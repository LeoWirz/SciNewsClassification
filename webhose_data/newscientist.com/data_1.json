Elmehed. \u00a9 Nobel Media 2017 By Andy Coghlan \nJust two years after their discovery, gravitational waves have earned a Nobel prize for Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne, the three leaders of the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration that found the waves on 14 September 2015. The discovery, which was announced publicly in 2016 , confirmed predictions made 100 years ago by Albert Einstein. \nHalf of the $1.1 million prize went to Weiss, the remainder shared between Barish and Thorne. \u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful, but I view this more as recognition of around 1000 people who contributed and a result of dedicated efforts over 40 years,\u201d said Weiss, reacting to the announcement. \n\u201cThe discovery, the first ever observation of gravity waves, is a milestone opening a new window into the universe,\u201d said Olga Botner of Uppsala University in Sweden, and a member of the Nobel committee for Physics that awarded the prize. \u201cEinstein was obviously right again, and the prize goes to the leaders of the international team for the discovery that shook the world.\u201d Advertisement Read more: Gravitational waves could show hints of extra dimensions \nBotner, co-announcing the award by the Swedish Academy of Sciences, explained that the waves originated 1.3 billion years ago, from the collision between two distant black holes. \nThey were detected within 69 milliseconds apart at LIGO\u2019s major detectors. The first trace at Hanford, Washington state, matched almost exactly the second at Livingston, Louisiana, 3000 kilometres away. Their perfect overlap allowed the team to rule out a false signal, said Botner. Laser discovery \nLIGO used a pair of laser interferometers to measure a change thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus as the wave passed through the Earth. \u201cThe detectors are amazingly sensitive,\u201d said Botner. \nWeiss\u2019s major contribution back in the 1970s at MIT was to find ways of cancelling out sources of background noise that could be mistaken for gravitational waves. \u201cA passing truck or waves lapping against the ocean shore had to be excluded,\u201d said Botner. Weiss pioneered ingenious ways of suspending mirrors that would capture the tiny movements caused by gravitational waves without any worldly disturbances. \nThorne, based at Caltech in Los Angeles, joined forces with Weiss to develop the interferometer itself, in collaboration with Scottish scientist, Ronald Drever, who passed away in March this year. \nBarish took over the reins in 1994 as leader of LIGO and transformed what was a small research group of 40 into a major international collaboration of 1000 scientists . \nResponding to the announcement today, Weiss said that the discovery would open new windows on sources of gravitational waves in the Universe. \u201cWe know about black holes and neutron stars, but we hope there are other phenomena we can see because of the gravitational waves they emit,\u201d he said.

The idea that beef from cows raised on bucolic pastures is good for the environment, and that we can therefore eat as much meat as we want, doesn\u2019t add up. New calculations suggest cattle pastures contribute to climate change. \n\u201cSadly, though it would be nice if the pro-grazers were right, they aren\u2019t,\u201d says lead author Tara Garnett of the University of Oxford\u2019s Food Climate Research Network. \u201cThe truth is, we cannot eat as much meat as we like and save the planet.\u201d \nMany meat eaters have long felt guilty that the beef steaks they love are bringing environmental disaster. Advertisement \nA key problem is that microorganisms in the guts of cattle emit millions of tonnes of methane every year. A typical cow releases 100 kilograms of methane a year and the world has about a billion of them. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, this exacerbates global warming. \nMeanwhile, feeding the beasts destroys forests by taking land for pasture or to grow feed \u2013 and this deforestation also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions . \nBut a counter-view has gained currency. First popularised by Zimbabwean ecologist and livestock farmer Allan Savory , and supported by organic farmers like Prince Charles , it argues that grazing cattle on pastures is actually good for the climate. \nThe idea is that plants on pastures capture carbon from the air, especially when fertilised by manure. Pastures should also reduce our need for food crops grown on land that releases carbon when ploughed. Doing the sums \nConfused by conflicting claims, Garnett and her colleagues calculated the flow of greenhouse gases into and out of pastures. She found that \u201cin some circumstances, you can get carbon capture, but not always and the effect is small. You cannot extrapolate from a nicely run Dorset farm to a global food strategy.\u201d \nAt best, carbon capture only offsets 20 to 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from grazing, mostly the methane from cattle. \u201cAnd the carbon capture stops after a few decades,\u201d says Garnett, when the carbon-enriched soils reach equilibrium with the air. \u201cMeanwhile, the cattle continue to belch methane.\u201d \nHer findings are published in a report, Grazed and Confused? \nThe analysis is more comprehensive than past studies, says Tim Benton at the University of Leeds, UK. \u201cIt asks, if we are to eat meat, is there a better way to grow it? The answer is: not really.\u201d Less meat \nSupporters of cattle grazing aren\u2019t giving up just yet, though. Some say cattle have simply replaced wild ruminants, which also release methane. But Garnett points out that many cattle, especially in the tropics, graze on former forest land. In places such as the Brazilian Amazon, clearing trees for cattle causes massive greenhouse gas emissions. \nAt low densities of around one animal per hectare, carbon capture in soils could still exceed methane emissions, says Richard Young of the Sustainable Food Trust in Bristol, UK, which supports cattle grazing. However, he concedes that this isn\u2019t true at higher densities. \nGarnett\u2019s conclusion is supported by a study published on 29 September, which found that methane emissions from cattle are 11 per cent larger than older methods would suggest, and thus a bigger contributor to global warming ( Carbon Balance and Management, doi.org/cdpz ). \n\u201cWe need to reduce emissions from livestock,\u201d says Benton. \u201cThat needs to come from dietary change.\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "garnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim benton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince charles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allan savory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred pearce  prince charles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tara garnett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sustainable food trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford\u2019s food climate research network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dorset", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:59:37.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d4f0b4fd20df34db1458521caaed5a6ee1cbb1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLamt2rTbPJa3qlEj7E7hegGG2GOJyE1XK2rEfuA5C_J_29qwiYXW3Y1nFjQEr5PJ9XOL_gmYY1npOueBaSxXifCji8GNLX6VJgA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Build an AI god?

Advertisement \nIn 2016, Macchiarini, who held an honorary professorship at UCL, was fired from the Karolinska Institute for multiple violations. \nThe inquiry highlighted several cases of misconduct, including that involving a 36-year-old Eritrean man living in Iceland , who had a slow growing tumour in his trachea. Macchiarini made the clinical decision to remove the tumour and replace the affected segment of trachea with a synthetic graft. This graft was provided by Alexander Seifalian, who no longer works at UCL.

Elmehed. \u00a9 Nobel Media 2017 By Clare Wilson \nThe discovery of a way to see complex biological molecules in atomic resolution has won this year\u2019s Nobel prize in Chemistry. The award has gone to Richard Henderson, Jacques Dubochet and Joachim Frank for developing cryo-electron microscopy, which cools down substances to liquid nitrogen temperatures. \nTheir techniques have recently let us see in unprecedented detail the surface of the Zika virus, bacterial proteins that cause antibiotic resistance, and tumour cell proteins that let cancers become resistant to chemotherapy. \nPrevious electron microscopes were less useful, partly because they need the sample to be placed in a vacuum. This causes surrounding water to evaporate, and the molecules being studied collapse and lose their normal structure. Electron microscopes were also too damaging, because they work by firing a beam of electrons at the sample. Advertisement \nRichard Henderson of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, found a way to protect biomolecules by coating their surface with a glucose solution that stopped it from drying out in the vacuum.

Lepp/Corbis/Getty By Chris Baraniuk \nThere are always better restaurants in the city, and that could be making the town mice of New York genetically distinct from their country cousins. \nStephen Harris at the State University of New York and Jason Munshi-South of Fordham University in New York City caught 48 white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) from three New York parks and three nearby rural areas. The mice are native to this part of North America, so the pair wanted to find out whether some had begun to evolve for city living. \nThey examined the mice\u2019s RNA to see if the rural and urban populations expressed different genes. Ultimately, they homed in on 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): places in the genome where a single letter varies from mouse to mouse. Advertisement \nSeveral SNPs were in genes associated with digestion and other metabolic processes. One highlighted gene was used to produce omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. A version of this gene appears to have been selected for in humans as we moved from hunter-gathering to agriculture. \nThe work is \u201cat the forefront of biology\u201d, says Jonathan Richardson at Providence College in Rhode Island. The cheeseburger hypothesis \nThe survey also highlighted genes linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which may result from having to process a lot of fatty acids. This could be due to a diet rich in fast foods. \u201cThe first thing that we thought of was the \u2018cheeseburger hypothesis\u2019: urban mice subsidising their diet on human food waste,\u201d says Harris. If so, the mice may be like \u201cPizza Rat\u201d, a New York rodent videoed carrying a whole slice of pizza. \nIn line with this, city mice had larger livers with more scar tissue, says Harris, who was at the City University of New York when most of the work was done. However, the sample size was too small to be sure. \nBesides, New York offers other foods, like seeds, nuts and berries in its parks. Such resources are more plentiful than in rural areas, where there is more competition from other species. \nThe mice may be enjoying an eclectic mix of urban food resources, says Richardson, occasionally boosting their calorie intake by dining on human food waste. \nThe next step will be to examine the function of these genes more closely to assess their impact on fitness and selection, says Hopi Hoekstra at Harvard University. \nHoekstra says the work is part of a wave of studies investigating examples of rapid adaptation. \u201cThat provides us with a really cool way to study evolutionary change, sort of as it\u2019s happening,\u201d she says.

A road map will be launched today that describes how the partners plan to cut deaths from the water-borne bacteria \u2013 now running at 95,000 a year \u2013 by 90 per cent by 2030 . \nThat will mean eliminating cholera from 20 of the 47 countries that have it, and enabling the rest to detect and stop outbreaks before they get out of control, according to this Global Task Force on Cholera Control. \nThe challenge is daunting. Three million people get cholera every year, in Asia, Africa and Haiti, and increasing urbanisation and temperatures will put more people at risk. In Yemen, the biggest epidemic in modern times is now approaching 800,000 cases, and is growing. Emergency experts say a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d outbreak looms in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.

Rich countries banished it a century ago, not with vaccines, but with toilets and hygiene. Falling funding \nIn poor countries, 2 billion people drink from water sources contaminated with faeces and 2.4 billion have no toilets, according to the WHO. Yet aid from rich countries to build sewage systems has fallen. \nThe WHO says spending on sanitation must prioritise \u201chotspots\u201d where cholera lurks all the time. Spending on cholera goes mostly to contain outbreaks in new places, leaving hotspots as continued sources of disease. \nThe task force\u2019s road map calls for coordinated investments \u2013 and for deployment of the real game changer, an oral cholera vaccine that has proved over the past few years that it can quickly contain outbreaks. Nearly a million doses are already en route for Bangladesh. \n\u201cThis disease doesn\u2019t deserve to be in this century,\u201d says Seth Berkley , head of the vaccine agency Gavi in Geneva. \u201cWe can make this a reality.\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "seth berkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter salama", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty by debora mackenzie  the world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "haiti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T15:31:46.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a1aed0c5fc19605fdb38888e869a1ba03fde179", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo7y.uyMPCA4BYkPdVMOUxGsf96tdL1RdVHe0e8YiFLSdRaGyJtplLR0FcSDBfDjbqWphqO4nTdN746NNZHk1DsIIDEwWqQZETQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "We\u2019ve finally seen how the sleeping brain stores memories", "title_full": "We\u2019ve finally seen how the sleeping brain stores memories", "published": "2017-10-04T18:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04141000/z220_168_new.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a1aed0c5fc19605fdb38888e869a1ba03fde179", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo7y.uyMPCA4BYkPdVMOUxGsf96tdL1RdVHe0e8YiFLSdRaGyJtplLR0FcSDBfDjbqWphqO4nTdN746NNZHk1DsIIDEwWqQZETQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T18:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "We\u2019ve finally seen how the sleeping brain stores memories", "text": "We\u2019ve finally seen how the sleeping brain stores memories Rest well to remember Elke Meitzel/Millennium Images, UK By Jessica Hamzelou \nAT LAST, we\u2019ve seen how the brain memories when we sleep. By scanning slumbering people, researchers have watched how the \u201ctrace\u201d of a memory moves from one region of the brain to another. \n\u201cThe initial memory trace kind of disappears, and at the same time, another emerges,\u201d says Shahab Vahdat at Stanford University in California. It is the first time memories have been observed being filed away in humans during sleep, he says. \nVahdat and his colleagues did this by finding people who were able to fall asleep in the confined, noisy space of an fMRI scanner, which is no easy undertaking. \u201cWe screened more than 50 people in a mock scanner, and only 13 made it through to the study,\u201d says Vahdat. Advertisement \nThe team then taught this group of volunteers to press a set of keys in a specific sequence \u2013 in the same way that a pianist might learn to play a tune. It took each person between about 10 and 20 minutes to master a sequence involving five presses. \u201cThey had to learn to play it as quickly and as accurately as possible,\u201d says Vahdat. \nOnce they had learned the sequence, each volunteer put on a cap of EEG electrodes to monitor the electrical activity of their brain, and entered an fMRI scanner \u2013 which detects which regions of the brain are active. \nThe team saw a specific pattern of brain activity while the volunteers performed the key-pressing task. Once they had stopped, this pattern kept replaying, as if each person was subconsciously revising what they had learned. \nThe volunteers were then asked to go to sleep, while the team monitored each of them for two-and-a-half hours. At first, the pattern of brain activity continued to replay in the outer region of the brain called the cortex, which is involved in higher thought. \nWhen the volunteers entered non-REM sleep \u2013 known as the stage when we have relatively mundane dreams \u2013 the pattern started to fade in the cortex, but a similar pattern of activity started in the putamen, a region deep within the brain ( eLife , doi.org/cdsz ). \u201cThe memory trace evolved during sleep,\u201d says Vahdat. \nHis team thinks that movement-related memories are transferred to deeper brain regions for long-term storage. This chimes with the hypothesis that the brain\u2019s cortex must free up space so that it can continue to learn new information, says Christoph Nissen at University Psychiatric Services in Bern, Switzerland. \nNon-REM sleep happens within a few hours of dozing off, says Vahdat. If you\u2019re hoping for some night-time learning, it\u2019s important to make sure that those first few hours are uninterrupted , he says. \nNissen hopes a better understanding of how memories are consolidated during sleep could lead to treatments for people with insomnia and similar sleep disorders. Such individuals tend to be treated with drugs that send them to sleep, but Nissen has found that this sleep doesn\u2019t seem to be as good at consolidating memories as natural sleep. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cHow our sleeping brain stores away memories\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elke meitzel/millenn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vahdat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nissen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica hamzelou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shahab vahdat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christoph nissen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stanford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university psychiatric services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T18:26:55.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ea5b48b50b9cc97c9e21ff5fb0cd81fe4ab1d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaprq8LYPcarJZdXI5PNtMRX9cTVqI9w2UjKvVEnTAkXBDbeVgamG_pDHcmuOOzMjGOlFzW1zpzwLqy85zX9ObO_eN_23JclEYg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/essays", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Phone calls can be beamed right into your central nervous system", "title_full": "Phone calls can be beamed right into your central nervous system", "published": "2017-10-04T19:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04150654/60_year_old-female_cards_1_cmyk1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ea5b48b50b9cc97c9e21ff5fb0cd81fe4ab1d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaprq8LYPcarJZdXI5PNtMRX9cTVqI9w2UjKvVEnTAkXBDbeVgamG_pDHcmuOOzMjGOlFzW1zpzwLqy85zX9ObO_eN_23JclEYg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T19:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Phone calls can be beamed right into your central nervous system", "text": "Phone calls can be beamed right into your central nervous system Direct to brain communication Edelman By Frank Swain \nJust what you need in the age of ubiquitous surveillance: the latest cochlear implants will allow users stream audio directly from their iPhone into their cochlear nerve. Apple and implant manufacturer Cochlear have made \u201cMade for iPhone\u201d connectivity available for any hearing implants that use the next-generation Nucleus 7 sound processor. The advance means that these implants can also stream music and Netflix shows. \nThe technology was first unveiled in 2014 when it was added to hearing aids such as the Starkey Halo and ReSound LiNX. But this is the first time it\u2019s been linked into the central nervous system. \nWhile some cochlear implants already offer Bluetooth connectivity, these often require users to wear extra dongles or other intermediary devices to pick up digital signals, and then rebroadcast them to the hearing aid as radio. This technology simply beams the signal right into the brain. Advertisement \nIt\u2019s also a better way to use Bluetooth. Bluetooth headsets have been commonplace since the early 2000s, but the energy-sapping technology has meant they are typically clunky devices with poor battery life. \nIn 2014, Apple technicians developed a way to stream audio over the low energy Bluetooth format used by wearables such as FitBits. Now, tiny devices like hearing aids \u2013 and Apple\u2019s Airpods \u2014 can stream audio signals for up to a week on a battery the size of an aspirin. \nThere is a small cost \u2013 the audio signal is highly compressed, and can sound much flatter than sounds from typical Bluetooth headsets. That\u2019s unlikely to be a problem for cochlear implant users, as these devices can only stimulate a limited number of frequencies in the ear anyway \u2014 because of this low sound quality, cochlear implants are reserved for those with profound hearing loss . \nHowever, the technology behind the new audio streaming models is likely to be adopted by consumer audio devices. Technology giants are betting heavily on audio interfaces becoming the norm in the future , all the better to further integrate voice-activated assistants such as Siri, OK Google, Cortana and Alexa into our daily routines. \nIt\u2019s likely that in the future most of us will wear discreet, \u201ctransparent\u201d ear buds that allow us to hear the world around us while also allowing us to field calls, texts, emails, and hear updates and directions directly from our phone . \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "edelm", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "frank swain  just", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cortana", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "starkey halo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T19:23:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a65884319f7b14a0f40bf41d62c6d106f3a936b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo7y.uyMPCA4BnNk_DFZEuTzvRvQASCnLSP1.so5Gd_RY37qElMuNePSf5gRCB7opUqrR8_9lxkBKLinmk5z.r8_RjTndM7h7gxPzbIWeiMQE", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/exploring-mars", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Our braininess may have evolved thanks to less sticky neurons", "title_full": "Our braininess may have evolved thanks to less sticky neurons", "published": "2017-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04150000/gettyimages-548000055_new.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a65884319f7b14a0f40bf41d62c6d106f3a936b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo7y.uyMPCA4BnNk_DFZEuTzvRvQASCnLSP1.so5Gd_RY37qElMuNePSf5gRCB7opUqrR8_9lxkBKLinmk5z.r8_RjTndM7h7gxPzbIWeiMQE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Our braininess may have evolved thanks to less sticky neurons", "text": "Our braininess may have evolved thanks to less sticky neurons Non-stick brain Zephyr/Science Photo Library By Clare Wilson \nOUR braininess may have evolved thanks to gene changes that made our brain cells less sticky. \nThe cortex is the thin, highly folded outer layer of our brains and it is home to some of our most sophisticated mental abilities, such as planning, language and complex thoughts. \nAround three millimetres thick, this layer is folded into an intricate pattern of ridges and valleys, which allows the cortex to be large, but still fit into a relatively small space. Many larger mammals, such as primates, dolphins and horses, have various patterns of folds in their cortex, but folds are rarer in smaller animals like mice. Advertisement \nSo far, we have only identified a few genetic mutations that contributed to the evolution of the human brain, including ones that boosted the number of cells in the cortex. One theory about how the cortex came to be folded is that it buckled as the layer of cells expanded . \nDaniel del Toro at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Munich, Germany, and colleagues wondered if some of the genetic changes in our brain\u2019s evolution might have been about more than just an increasing number of cells. They investigated the genes for two molecules \u2013 FLRT1 and FLRT3 \u2013 which make developing brain cells stick to each other more. \u201cIf brain cells are less sticky, they may form more complex structures within the cortex\u201d \nHuman brain cells produce only a small amount of these compounds, while mice brain cells make lots. Del Toro\u2019s team created mice embryos that lacked functioning FLRT1 and FLRT3 genes, which meant their cortex cells were only loosely attached to each other, like those of humans. \nWhen the genetically altered mice were born and grew into adults, they had more folded brains. This finding was presented at the Cortex Evolution and Development conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, last month. But it is still unclear if these mice are smarter \u2013 that is what the team plans to study next. \nWhy would less sticky brain cells lead to a folded cortex? As a human fetus develops, new brain cells are produced in the middle of the head, and then move outwards until they reach the surface and become the cortex. Del Toro speculates that the stickier cells in normal mice might make the cortex layer too rigid to deform into wrinkles. \u201cImagine a line of people running together holding hands,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end, they all arrive at the same time.\u201d \nThe looser bonding of human brain cells might also allow them to migrate at different speeds and so form more complex structures within the cortex, says del Toro. \nBut it is too soon to conclude that this was a key change in our evolutionary history, says Todd Preuss at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University, Georgia, because the study only compared humans and mice. \u201cIt would be interesting to see what these genes are doing in other primates and mammals.\u201d \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cHow we got our folded brains?\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "todd preuss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "del toro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clare wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel del toro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yerkes national primate research center of emory university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max planck institute of neurobiology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "copenhagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T19:35:09.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "736787ad18a8bc800156956275ca9db02271ec22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLarpeScQjBtKZIvGrJfR1iJWturCtDV.xKmGOujzkE.WEOpAxcAwcGKv5lpqBeb8R.cD7X.d4eujaEFRdEaIZf88jG3psWr2fqQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/energy-fuels", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "The US will not ban guns so must learn how to live with them", "title_full": "The US will not ban guns so must learn how to live with them", "published": "2017-10-04T19:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04164617/gettyimages-91474106.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "736787ad18a8bc800156956275ca9db02271ec22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLarpeScQjBtKZIvGrJfR1iJWturCtDV.xKmGOujzkE.WEOpAxcAwcGKv5lpqBeb8R.cD7X.d4eujaEFRdEaIZf88jG3psWr2fqQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T19:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "The US will not ban guns so must learn how to live with them", "text": "4 October 2017 The US will not ban guns so must learn how to live with them The political reality is that the US will never be rid of its weapons.

So say scientists who have analysed sediment from the South China Sea \u2013 but not everyone is convinced. \nSeveral early civilisations hit a crisis point about 4000 years ago . The global climate cooled, and this has been linked to the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in ancient Mesopotamia, the end of the Indus valley civilisation of South Asia and the fall of the Liangzhu culture in what is now eastern China. \nCooling was also felt on Hainan island off China\u2019s southern coast, according to Fangjian Xu at the China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, Bangqi Hu at the Qingdao Institute of Marine Geology, and their colleagues. The cooling led to an increase in heavy metal pollution in the South China Sea. Advertisement \nXu and his colleagues looked at two sediment cores from just south-east of Hainan. They calculated \u201cenrichment factors\u201d for several metals. A value of 1 or below indicates no enrichment, while values between 1 and 3 suggest \u201cminor enrichment\u201d . Farms not fish \nThe enrichment factors of cadmium and lead hovered around 1 before the 4000-year mark, but afterwards increased to about 1.5. In other words, human activity on Hainan 4000 years ago led to a subtle but detectable uptick in heavy metal pollution in the South China Sea, says the team. \nThe group suggests that the change was linked to the global cooling at the time, when Hainan would have cooled and dried. Lower monsoon activity would have triggered a reduction in coastal upwelling, lowering marine productivity and encouraging Hainan\u2019s inhabitants to focus on farming rather than fishing. \nRun-off into the sea from farms would have included heavy metals, which were accumulating in soil because of the use of metal tools. \nSamuel Toucanne at the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea in Plouzan\u00e9 was involved in a 2015 analysis of South China Sea sediment from further west , derived from the Red River that runs through China and Vietnam. There, the evidence of human-related pollution from lead, copper and arsenic began only 1800 years ago. Questionable link \nToucanne says the uptick in pollution 4000 years ago is gradual rather than clear-cut. \u201cBut they use this precise age to discuss global climate and the relationship with human activities,\u201d he says. It is questionable whether there is a direct link between the climate cooling 4000 years ago and the increase in pollution off Hainan. \nThere is also evidence of increased precipitation on some parts of Hainan in response to the climate change , says James Innes at Durham University, UK. \u201cSo increased aridity at Hainan around this time isn\u2019t for certain.\u201d \nStill, Innes thinks the proposed scenario is plausible. \u201cDeclining productivity offshore could have led to increased agriculture on Hainan island,\u201d he says. \nHowever, Peter Clift at Louisiana State University is unconvinced. He says other evidence suggests pollution from metalworking on the mainland only began to affect the South China Sea about 2000 years ago . \u201cI find it difficult to believe that little Hainan island was much more developed 4000 years ago.\u201d \nHowever, there is precedent for significant pollution that long ago. In 2013, Francisco Jim\u00e9nez-Espejo at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology in Yokosuka found lead pollution in the Iberian peninsula about 4000 years ago . He has since found evidence that archaic humans like Neanderthals caused localised heavy metal pollution . \u201cBut the amount we are talking is so low that it is not considered harmful or dangerous for human [health],\u201d says Jim\u00e9nez-Espejo.

We are used to getting lots of warning before an earthquake \u2013 and this time, we didn\u2019t. \nSince 1993, Mexico City has had a fully operational earthquake early warning system. When a magnitude 8.1 quake struck on 8 September, the city got over a minute of warning. \nBut 19 September\u2019s quake showed that the system can\u2019t handle all types of events. The limited warning it gave holds lessons for all countries working to give their citizens a head start. Advertisement \n\u201cThis event in Mexico City is critical,\u201d says Richard Allen at the University of California, Berkeley. \nMexico\u2019s warning system was born after a 1985 earthquake that levelled parts of the city and claimed thousands of lives. Mexico\u2019s unique quakes meant the system was particularly viable. \nThe quakes are generated by two continental plates that meet along much of Mexico\u2019s west coast. Mexico City lies hundreds of kilometres away, so it ought to be safe. But the city was built on a loose lakebed topped with looser landfill. This soil picks up tremors from far away. In 1985, shifting soil went on toppling buildings long after the quake had petered out. \nHowever, with such a long distance between the epicentre and the city, scientists could create a warning system. Today, a 1985-style quake on the coast will trigger alarms in Mexico City 60 to 90 seconds before it arrives. \n\u201cIf you have minutes, you can empty any school practically anywhere,\u201d says Gerardo Suarez at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. \nBut the warning on 19 September was more like 0 to 5 seconds. That\u2019s because the quake began elsewhere in the plate boundary, deeper and closer to the city. It was more the sort of tremor that could strike California. \u201cIn my house, the warning arrived at the same time as the first shocks. Others slipped down the stairwell\u201d \nFor decades, Allen pushed California to build a warning system. In 2014, he got federal funding and in 2018 a prototype will start issuing limited alerts. Unlike Mexico\u2019s system, it will only give about 10 seconds of warning. \nThere are many pitfalls. What if it gives too many false alarms, so people ignore them and are caught out by quakes? What if the system misses the big one? And what if 10 seconds just isn\u2019t enough time? Understanding what Mexicans did in such a short window might help the US. \nIt won\u2019t be easy. In my house, the warning arrived at the same time as the first shocks. Others say they ended up in a pile of people slipping and falling down the stairwell. \n\u201cWhat are you going to do with a 5, 8, 10-second warning?\u201d Suarez wonders. His wife was able to leave the store she was shopping in and get to the street, but she was lucky. He says most people won\u2019t be able to do much except duck under their desks. \nHowever, even if people cannot do much in mere seconds, computers can do plenty. Suarez says many responses could be automated. Computers could halt trains, stop elevators at the next floor and warn surgeons. He also suggests broadcasting a countdown so people know how long they have. \nThere are limits to warning systems. A recent study found no way to tell if a brewing quake will be huge until it\u2019s too late (Science, doi.org/cdd6 ). So it will always be a matter of seconds. The trick will be to make the best use of those seconds to save lives. \n\u201cI personally believe that no children should die below the rubble of their own school,\u201d Suarez says. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cEven a few seconds\u2019 warning can save lives\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alejan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "richard allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suarez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerardo suarez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik vance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of california, berkeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national autonomous university of mexico", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico city 60", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T21:14:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41b62e1711604050d8a99806473084e5bd4afea4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_yUDNQThcAv6W_lqoyAnNzBqtvkNgnPO0X0FzqOHcX72OHPPROJDSd_dFWuLaBcqjYbHPyNgNIE72fZ6yAGNTuwycDUUPySc4dVFXodjzy_", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/60-seconds", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "DNA testing firms are cashing in our genes.

What if your accountant likes to go base jumping at the weekend \u2013 might she be more likely to take risks with your money than someone who relaxes by playing golf instead? \nThe answer to both seems to be yes. The most comprehensive study yet into how people respond to risk has found there is a common component that drives all types of risk-taking. \nHow eager we are to engage in risky activities is known as our risk preference. Psychologists consider this a key component of human behaviour because its impact on our decision-making has consequences \u2013 often dramatic ones \u2013 for so many aspects of our lives. Advertisement \nDespite its importance, there is a lack of consensus over whether people\u2019s tendency to take risks is consistent or whether it varies depending on the type of risk. To find out, Renato Frey at the University of Basel in Switzerland and his colleagues asked 1500 adults to complete 39 tests commonly used to measure risk preference in different scenarios. \nControlling for age and gender, they found that 61 per cent of the variation in an individual\u2019s scores across the tests could be explained by a single component, with the rest of the variation explained by factors specific to the different types of risk. G whizz \nThis is similar to how we understand intelligence. Because people who excel at one cognitive test tend to do so on them all, psychologists often talk about a general factor of intelligence , known as g, to explain this across-the-board performance. If you have a high g score, you are likely to do well on any type of cognitive test. But how well you do on any one test will also depend on other factors, such as you possessing abilities that are helpful for that specific test. \nFrey and his team\u2019s results suggest that people\u2019s risk preference scores can be explained by both a general component they call R, and seven specific components that relate to different types of risk. The general component could be driven by mechanisms such as a person\u2019s risk perception, their genetic disposition or level of understanding of risk \u2013 common factors that would apply no matter what the situation. \nSpecific factors such as recreational risk-taking could be explained by things like an individual\u2019s desire for thrilling experiences, or problems with disinhibition could underlie risky health behaviours such as smoking or drinking to excess. \nThe existence of the general component, plus the finding that people\u2019s R value was fairly consistent when the team retested participants after six months, suggests that risk preference should be considered an enduring psychological trait like intelligence, says Frey. \n\u201cRisk preference seems to have a core, stable component, like other personality traits, and is not something which is entirely \u2018created\u2019 in the moment as a function of external stimuli, the context or the environment,\u201d says Matteo Galizzi at the London School of Economics. \nThis means we could start to explore the biological foundations of risky behaviour and use it to help people. \u201cIf you could identify someone from their genes or neural anatomy who was likely to be highly prone to taking risks in adolescence or later in life, you could teach that person to be aware of risks and the potential dangers involved,\u201d says Frey.

Just like physical exercise, the kind of improvements you get depends on exactly how you train \u2013 and most of us are doing it all wrong. \nThat the brain changes physically when we learn a new skill, like juggling or playing a musical instrument, has been known for over a decade. Previous studies had suggested that meditation does something similar for parts of the brain involved in focused attention. \nTwo new studies published in Science Advances suggest that certain kinds of meditation can change social and emotional circuitry, too. The research comes out of the ReSource Project at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, and looked at the effects of three different meditation techniques on the brains and bodies of more than 300 volunteers over 9 months. Advertisement \nOne technique was based on mindfulness meditation , and taught people to direct attention to the breath or body. A second type concentrated on compassion and emotional connection via loving kindness meditations and non-judgmental problem-sharing sessions with a partner. A final method encouraged people to think about issues from different points of view, also via a mix of partnered sessions and solo meditation. \nIn one study , MRI scans taken after each three-month course showed that parts of the cortex involved in the specific skill that was trained grew thicker in comparison with scans from a control group. \nMindfulness meditation increased thickness in the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobes, both linked to attention control, while compassion-based meditation showed increases in the limbic system, which processes emotions, and the anterior insula, which helps bring emotions into conscious awareness. Perspective-taking training boosted regions involved in theory of mind . \nAll of the brain changes were matched by improvements in tests of the relevant skills. Just like exercise \nTania Singer, a social neuroscientist and the lead researcher on the study, says that meditation courses should be better designed for specific outcomes, just as exercise programmes might target certain physical weaknesses. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking a sport expert \u2018what does sport do to your body\u2019. The expert would say, do you mean swimming or horse-riding? You can imagine mental training being as complex,\u201d she says. \nRoi Cohen Kadosh, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, thinks the findings are potentially important. \u201cWe still have to see how it affects everyday life. But if there are changes in real life, that could be pretty significant,\u201d he says. He also points out that all the volunteers first did mindfulness meditation, so it is an open question is whether any change depends on first having done some attention training. But, he says, \u201cit\u2019s progress\u201d. \nA second study looked at meditation\u2019s impact on stress levels in the same volunteers. Many studies have reported that meditation makes people feel calmer, but the effects on levels of the stress hormone cortisol have been mixed. The problem could be that meditation tends to be a solo activity. \nThe researchers found that mindfulness meditation alone made the volunteers feel calmer when asked to give a presentation at short notice, but their cortisol levels were no different from those in controls. \nAfter engaging in face-to-face sessions with a partner in addition to compassion or perspective-based meditation, however, volunteers showed up to a 51 per cent drop in cortisol levels compared with controls. \nSinger says this is important because most of the stress that we experience in modern life is social stress: the fear of being judged harshly or falling short of expectations. This kind of stress is linked to mental health problems and disease, and the new findings suggest that mindfulness meditation alone may not save us from it. \nWhen it does work, Singer says, it\u2019s probably down to the social aspect of attending a meditation group rather than the practice itself. \u201cIt\u2019s not just getting calm [that\u2019s responsible],\u201d she says.

Read on to discover how to take control of your wandering mind, and other simple ways to stay sharp when deadlines are looming. 1. Give your mind more to do \nGive your mind more to do: Research by Nilli Lavie at University College London has found that adding deliberate distractions \u2013 a jazzy border on a page or a bit of background noise \u2013 actually reduces distractibility . Her \u201cload theory\u201d proposes this works because attention is a limited resource, so if you fill all the attentional \u201cslots\u201d in your mind, it leaves no room for other distractions. 2. Bribe yourself \nThe prospect of a treat can keep people focused , but only when it is well-timed, studies show. Offering people small rewards throughout a boring task didn\u2019t stop them from losing focus, but the promise of a larger reward that they would receive at the end of the task kept them alert. This approach probably works best with an accomplice to keep you from caving early, says Michael Esterman , at the Boston Attention and Learning Laboratory, who did the research. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fool yourself.\u201d Daydreaming need not be the enemy of focus. Learn to do it right and you could reap the benefits from more successful revision to more motivation 3. Test yourself \nWe\u2019re currently finding that there\u2019s more than one way your mind can wander, and that knowing how to navigate your daydreams could save you come exam time. One trick is to make sure your mind is wandering about the stuff you need to learn . To do that, test yourself often. People retained more of a boring lecture if they paused to test what they remembered every 5 minutes. Their minds still wandered, but wandered on topic, rather than anything but . 4. Daydream during breaks \nStopping every now and again to give your mind a chance to wander can invigorate focus, says psychologist Paul Seli of Harvard University. \u201cIf you say to yourself, now I\u2019m going to think about something unrelated, maybe problem-solve something else that is on your mind, and then come back to your task. That can definitely be beneficial,\u201d he says. 5. De-stress \nYou might think that an adrenaline boost would focus the mind, but stress actually stimulates the release of hormones, including noradrenaline, which bind to receptors in the cognitive control circuits. This in turn makes it harder for them to keep tabs on mind wandering. 6. Get some zeds \nA lack of sleep hammers mental performance in general, and reduces our ability to resist both internal and external distractions. And there\u2019s an added bonus \u2013 sleep is also important for memory consolidation. In fact, recent research suggests that if you have an hour spare before an exam, a nap could be a more effective use of your time than spending it revising. 7.

We\u2019re finally working out how to fight it Robert Carter By Caroline Williams \nJOB, kids, mortgage, bills, groceries, housework\u2026 coping with modern life can sometimes feel like a remorseless treadmill. Many of us end up exhausted, with a vague feeling that all this pressure can\u2019t be doing us any good. But we do it anyway, driven by the notion that stress is for wimps. And there\u2019s always a glass of wine and a takeaway to look forward to at the end of the week. \nBig mistake. Far from being for wimps, physical and psychological stress are major triggers of a modern scourge that has been linked with every malady from heart disease, depression and chronic pain to neurodegenerative diseases. That scourge is inflammation. Until recently, we have known little about how what starts as a protective immune process in the body goes awry, and there have been frustratingly few evidence-based suggestions on what we should do about it. But now we are starting to learn more about how the process works, how it connects body and mind, and what we might do to keep it in check. This new understanding is leading to treatments that may finally let us douse this constant fire \u2013 not by stopping it from happening, but by turning it off when it is no longer useful. \nSuch treatments could benefit the millions of people around the world who have chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and coeliac disease. They could also assist those of us who want to have our cake, eat it and not end up inflamed .

Bates \nSnakes fed a diet of toxic toads become toxic too \u2014 and they seem to know it. \nWhile many snakes make their own toxins, not all do. Japan\u2019s tiger keelback snake ( Rhabdophis tigrinus ) is one of a handful of species that can store toxins it acquires from its food. \nTiger keelback snakes are usually less than a metre long, an ideal meal for many birds and mammals. But they eat toxic toads and store the toxins in specialised organs on the backs of their necks called nuchal glands . Advertisement \nIf a snake is threatened it arches its neck, making the nuchal gland area more prominent. A predator that bit the snake\u2019s neck would probably get a jet of fluid from the glands straight in the mouth or face, which would be distasteful or even painful. \nBut not all keelbacks exhibit this defensive behaviour. Snakes from a toad-free island flee when attacked, rather than standing their ground. Now it seems the snakes know whether or not they are armed with toxins. \nAkira Mori of Kyoto University, Japan, and Gordon Burghardt of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville reared hatchling snakes from toad-free and toad-rich Japanese islands. The snakes were fed controlled diets containing toxic toads \u2013 or not. \nWhen snakes from the toad-free island were fed toads, they started responding to threats with nuchal gland displays, rather than slithering away. Know thyself \n\u201cSo far as I know, this is the only example in terrestrial vertebrates where there is some indication that animals act as if they are aware of when they are toxic and when they are not,\u201d says Burghardt. \nApart from snakes, plenty of animals acquire toxins from what they eat, but Burghardt says there is no sign they change their behaviour depending on what they have eaten. \u201cPoison dart frogs in captivity are not fed the types of food that make them toxic, but their behaviour towards predators does not seem to have changed at all,\u201d he says. \n\u201cIt is remarkable that the researchers were able to demonstrate not only a difference in behaviour between these two populations, but that if you feed toads to toxin-free snakes, they are able to adjust their behaviour in a manner consistent with being chemically defended,\u201d says Alan Savitzky of Utah State University in Logan. \nHow they know is an open question. The snakes could somehow monitor the amount of toxin in their glands. Alternatively, they might detect changes in the microbial community living in their digestive system, which would be influenced by toxin levels. \nJournal reference: Journal of Comparative Psychology , DOI: 10.1037/com 75 \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T17:27:46.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18b40ed7d45a60ed82d41c6def1c42d52acebb5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLatGJqV0LSBX3Yb7j65LCWa1qPQs7WoajAKlfAou7YDB1gB7FUBBrlZoAmyRZogMbeir2KbM_laGk.HGO2oEv9zFCIMVCfqVUXQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/climate-change", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "The sun\u2019s energy could speed up dark matter so we can detect it", "title_full": "The sun\u2019s energy could speed up dark matter so we can detect it", "published": "2017-10-05T18:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/05151724/prom005.tif_.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18b40ed7d45a60ed82d41c6def1c42d52acebb5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLatGJqV0LSBX3Yb7j65LCWa1qPQs7WoajAKlfAou7YDB1gB7FUBBrlZoAmyRZogMbeir2KbM_laGk.HGO2oEv9zFCIMVCfqVUXQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T18:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "The sun\u2019s energy could speed up dark matter so we can detect it", "text": "The sun\u2019s energy could speed up dark matter so we can detect it Dark matter accelerator? SOHO/NASA By Lean Crane \nWe don\u2019t yet know what dark matter is made of, but the sun might help us find out. If dark matter particles are extremely light, they could bounce off atomic nuclei within the sun and gain enough energy in the process that we could detect them. \nChris Kouvaris at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense and his colleagues calculate that particles of this \u201csub-GeV\u201d dark matter could be accelerated to speeds in excess of 600 kilometres per second in this way. \nDark matter permeates the cosmos, so if these sub-GeV particles exist some of them should be hitting the sun all the time. As they bounce around within the sun, some would gain enough speed to escape towards Earth. Advertisement \nFaster particles are easier to detect because they have more energy, so this solar boost could be the key to making dark matter visible to us. \nBut the sub-GeV dark matter particles will need to interact with the normal matter in our detectors. For this to happen, they will need a helper particle to mediate that interaction. For example, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), another leading contender for dark matter, interact with ordinary matter by exchanging subatomic particles called W and Z bosons. \n\u201cThere are basically two particles that are needed: you need the dark matter particles, and you need some other particle for them to interact through,\u201d says Daniel McKinsey at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cSome of my more sceptical colleagues would say that it\u2019s like believing in two tooth fairies. I say, if you believe in one tooth fairy, why not two?\u201d \nMcKinsey says this idea is still a \u201cbig deal\u201d, because it gives us an entirely new way to look for dark matter after decades of fruitless searching. Need for speed \nThe upper speed limit for particles to remain inside our galaxy is 544 kilometres per second. If they go any faster than that, gravity won\u2019t be able to keep them within the Milky Way. \n\u201cIf it has a larger velocity than the escape velocity of the galaxy, then it\u2019ll go out of the galaxy and we\u2019ll never be able to detect it,\u201d says Kouvaris. Unless, that is, Earth gets in the way \u2013 a prospect that is much more likely if the particles are accelerated to such high speeds by our sun. \nCurrent detectors aren\u2019t sensitive enough to see any of these particles that happen to hit our planet after getting a boost from the sun. But upcoming instruments like the upgraded CRESST-III detector in Italy may be able to detect them. \nDark matter makes up over 80 per cent of the universe\u2019s mass, so if the new detectors do find these particles, Kouvaris and McKinsey agree, it\u2019ll be the biggest discovery in modern physics. And if they don\u2019t, researchers will simply have to find new ways to look.

Burton/Getty By Douglas Heaven \nThe internet has a personality problem . Abusive behaviour is a scourge in most corners of the internet, from website comments sections to social media to chat sessions in online games. Attempts to clamp down have yielded frustrating results \u2013 the concept is just too slippery. But a new way of automatically identifying the subtle linguistic fingerprints of true hate speech \u2013 and separating it from more benign uses of similar words \u2013 could finally help crack down on the worst offenders. \n\u201cHate speech is notoriously difficult to detect,\u201d says Dana Warmsley at Cornell University in New York. Simply using offensive language does not make someone abusive. People swear for all sorts of reasons. Friends call each other names for fun. Advertisement \nMost platforms rely on their users to report abuse. But human moderators cannot keep up with the torrent of objectionable content. \nAnother option is to detect hate speech automatically. Earlier this year, Google tried to assign comments a \u201ctoxic\u201d score based on how similar they were to other phrases people had previously deemed offensive. However, the shortcomings overwhelmed the positive effects. \u201cyou\u2019re pretty smart for a girl\u201d was deemed 18 per cent similar to comments people had deemed toxic, whereas \u201ci love Fuhrer\u201d was 2 per cent similar. \nSo Haji Mohammad Saleem at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and his colleagues went for a different approach. Instead of focusing on isolated words and phrases, they taught machine learning software to spot hate speech by learning how members of hateful communities speak . They trained their system on a data dump that contains most of the posts made to Reddit between 2006 and 2016. They focused on three groups who are often the target of abuse: African Americans, overweight people and women. For each of these, they chose the most active support and abuse groups on Reddit to train their software. They also took comments from Voat \u2013 a forum site similar to Reddit \u2013 as well as individual websites dedicated to hate speech. Offensive speech \nThe team found that their approach contained fewer false positives than a keyword-based detector. For example, it was able to flag comments that contained no offensive keyword, such as \u201cI don\u2019t see the problem here. Animals attack other animals all the time,\u201d in which the term \u201canimals\u201d was being used as a racist slur. \n\u201cComparing hateful and non-hateful communities to find the language that distinguishes them is a clever solution,\u201d says Thomas Davidson at Cornell University, who \u2013 together with Warmsley \u2013 has trained machine learning software to tell the difference between offensive and inoffensive speech by feeding it hand-picked examples of both. \nBut he is not convinced the solution is as widely applicable as Saleem and his colleagues suggest. The team tested their system on Reddit comments but they have not shown that it will catch targeted abuse on Twitter or Facebook, for example. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a sensible approach but it won\u2019t catch everything,\u201d says Joanna Bryson at the University of Bath, UK. The system still missed clearly offensive speech, such as \u201cBlack people are terrible\u201d and others that are clearly racist, or fat-shaming. Bryson points out that a keyword-based approach would have caught these comments. \nBut it could be yet another tool in the hands of competent moderators. Despite the difficulties, there may be no way to avoid keeping humans in the loop. \u201cUltimately, hate speech is a subjective phenomenon that requires human judgment to identify,\u201d says Davidson.

Lee Grismer By Michael Le Page \nThe number of known species of geckos has just jumped upwards, with 15 new species being formally described this week. \n\u201cAnd if you count the four I\u2019m looking at right now it\u2019s 19,\u201d says Lee Grismer of La Sierra University in California. \u201cWhen you called I was in the process of describing them.\u201d \nThis is a big increase, as there are only around 1500 known species of these lizards, famed for the sticking power of their feet . Advertisement \nThe 19 species all live in a small area of Myanmar just 90 by 50 kilometres in size. \u201cThat\u2019s the really amazing thing about it,\u201d says Grismer. \u201cThey all come from such a small area.\u201d \nIt\u2019s common to find lots of closely-related species of invertebrates like snails or insects in such a small area, but it is unprecedented for a backboned animal, say Grismer. \u201cFor lizards, it is remarkable.\u201d Another new Cyrtodactylus gecko L. Lee Grismer \nThe reason is likely to do with the unusual landscape. In an otherwise-flat lowland area, great blocks of limestone rise up to 400 metres high. Their surfaces are highly corrugated and sculpted by erosion, and sometimes riddled with caves. \nThese limestone blocks, some just a kilometre across, are evolutionary islands where isolated geckos have evolved into separate species. The limestone-dwelling geckos tend to have longer legs and toes, and more slender bodies, than their lowland kin. \nGrismer\u2019s team was asked to explore the area in Myanmar by the charity Fauna & Flora International , which is campaigning to preserve the unusual limestone habitat. The new geckos all lived in the same small area L. Lee Grismer \nIn their first trip in 2016, the team found the first 15 geckos, as well as new snakes and frogs. \u201cIt was fricking crazy, man,\u201d says Grismer. \u201cIn 19 days we found 23 new species.\u201d \nIn a later trip, they found the four geckos yet to be formally described. \nWhile the newly found geckos are restricted to tiny areas, they are abundant there, maybe because they are safe from many of the predators on the surrounding plains. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re the only one who occupies a 7-Eleven,\u201d says Grismer. \u201cIt may not be a Wal-Mart, but it\u2019s all yours.\u201d Hemiphyllodactylus montawaensis L. Lee Grismer \nSome of the blocks are being mined for limestone, and there were explosions nearby as the team worked, says Grismer. But other blocks have caves regarded as sacred by Buddhists, and these are fiercely guarded by monks. \nMost of the new species of gecko belong to a large genus collectively known as bent-toed geckos . But to Grismer\u2019s surprise, the team also found three species of dwarf gecko, which are usually found only on cloudy mountaintops .

Edward Marti/JILA By Aylin Woodward \nIt\u2019s about time. The most precise atomic clock ever made has been created by arranging strontium atoms in a grid-like pattern and then stacking those grids like pancakes. \nMost atomic clocks use atoms of the isotope caesium-133. The ticking of time is measured through microwaves emitted by the electrons around those atoms jumping from a lower to higher orbit as they absorb and then lose energy from a laser. \nBut these clocks are constrained in how precisely they can divide time because caesium electrons have a speed limit: they can only jump back and forth 9 billion times per second. The electrons in strontium atoms can transition nearly 1 million billion times per second. Advertisement \n\u201cIn 2014, the world\u2019s most accurate optical clock wouldn\u2019t lose or gain one second in the entire age of the universe ,\u201d says Jun Ye at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Previous caesium clocks kept time accurately to within a second over the course of 300 million years. \nNow, Ye\u2019s group has built a strontium clock that is so precise, out of every 10 quintillion ticks only 3.5 would be out of sync \u2013 the first atomic clock ever to reach that level of precision. Controlling the atoms \nTo build a more precise clock, Ye and his team designed a 3D structure that let them measure signals from more atoms at once within the width of the laser beam. But if you pack in too many, the signal can get blurred by collisions between atoms. \nThe latticework enabled the researchers to survey atoms that were much more densely packed together \u2013 10 trillion atoms per cubic centimetre compared with previous clocks with 10 billion atoms per cubic centimetre \u2013 and have better control of those atoms\u2019 interactions, minimising how often they crash into each other. \nThey cooled the atoms to -273\u02daC and trapped each one in its own spot to control the interactions between them. \u201cImagine a scenario where you have single-person housing in a city block. One person lives in each house and neighbours are never allowed in,\u201d says Ye. \u201cEach atom fits in one particular site.\u201d \nYe says the ultracold temperatures turn the atoms into what is known as a quantum gas. \u201cWhen atoms in the gaseous phase are very hot, they\u2019re moving apart and colliding with each other,\u201d he says. \u201cThis changes when you lower the temperature of the gas so much that these particles start to move like waves \u2013 they start to avoid each other.\u201d Time will tell \nMore precise clocks will allow us to test theories like Einstein\u2019s general relativity \u2013 which says clocks run differently should they experience different gravitational forces \u2013 and search for gravitational waves that alter the passage of time in deep space. \nAlthough it is the most precise atomic clock ever made, it hasn\u2019t run long enough to confirm how accurate it will remain over time, Ye says. \nChristian Lisdat at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Germany is interested in how the 3D-lattice arrangement will influence the clock\u2019s accuracy, but he is convinced the results are sound. \u201cIt is an impressive demonstration of what one can do,\u201d Lisdat says.

Now it seems the problem isn\u2019t limited to Europe and North America, where the alarm was first sounded. It\u2019s everywhere. \nIn 2013 the EU temporarily banned neonicotinoid s on crops that attract bees, such as oilseed rape. In November, the European Food Safety Authority will decide if the evidence warrants a total ban . France has already announced one . A sweet selection Blaise Mulhauser, Botanical Garden Neuch\u00e2tel (Switzerland) Advertisement \nStarting in 2012, a team led by Alex Aebi of the University of Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland, asked travelling colleagues, friends and relatives to bring back honey when they went abroad. In three years they amassed 198 samples from every continent except Antarctica, and tested them for neonicotinoids. \nThey found that three-quarters of the samples contained at least one of the five neonicotinoid pesticides. Of those, nearly half contained between two and five different neonicotinoids. \nMost worryingly, in 48 per cent of the contaminated samples, the neonicotinoids were at levels that exceeded the minimum dose known to cause \u201cmarked detrimental effects\u201d in pollinators. \u201cThe situation is indeed bad for pollinators,\u201d says Aebi. It\u2019s all around us \n\u201cFinding neonicotinoids in honey is perhaps not surprising,\u201d says Christopher Connolly of the University of Dundee, UK. After all, the pesticides are widely used. \u201cBut to find neuroactive levels, in so many samples at many global sites, is shocking.\u201d \nBees survive the winter by eating honey, so the results imply they are chronically exposed to neonicotinoids. \u201cRecent scientific evidence showed an increased sensitivity to neonicotinoids after frequent or long-term exposure,\u201d says Aebi. \nThe fact that the honey contained cocktails of neonicotinoids may also be a problem. They all act on different receptor proteins in the nervous systems of the insects. Some chemicals can boost each others\u2019 toxic effects over time, says Connolly. However, there is only indirect evidence of this happening with the neonicotinoids so far. \nFrustratingly, we have the data to figure out how real-world levels of the pesticides affect bees , but not in a useful form. Farmers in Europe and North America record their use of neonicotinoids, says Connolly, but this data needs to be gathered into geographical databases. Such databases could reveal local correlations between pesticide use and insect health. Aebi and his team are now urging governments to start collecting the data.

Photodsotiroff/Getty By Mallory Locklear \nWatch the cost. People are more likely to experience stronger side effects when a treatment appears to be more expensive, according to a study of the nocebo effect . \nWhile the placebo effect means that some people feel better when they have unknowingly been given a sham or control treatment, the nocebo works the opposite way. Researchers frequently observe nocebo effects in clinical trials, when people who receive a placebo experience negative side effects as if they had been given an actual drug. \nPlacebos are known to have stronger positive effects the more expensive the person receiving them believes them to be. Alexandra Tinnermann , at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, and her colleagues wondered if price might also affect the strength of the nocebo effect. Advertisement \nThe team created two packages for fake creams and told volunteers that they are used to treat itchy skin. One package looked like an expensive pharmaceutical brand name, while the other looked like a cheaper, generic medication. \nThe participants were shown one of the two creams and told that it was believed to increase a person\u2019s sensitivity to pain as a side effect. Pain sensitivity \nThe team then applied creams to participants\u2019 arms, and exposed their limbs to increasing levels of heat. Each person was asked to rank the discomfort they felt. \nThe participants given the more expensive-looking cream reported more pain than those given the cheaper-looking cream. Relative to a control cream that was described as having no active ingredients, the generic-looking cream raised pain on average by around 3 per cent, while the expensive-looking cream increased pain by nearly 30 per cent. \nThe finding confirms that the price of a treatment effects not only placebo strength, but nocebo power too. \nDuring the pain test, the team collected fMRI images of the brain, brainstem and spinal cord. They found that activity in a particular area of the prefrontal cortex and a region called the periaqueductal gray varied depending on what cream had been given. Both these areas are part of the neural pain pathway, and have also been implicated in mediating placebo effects. \nThe findings may help refine how doctors nurses and pharmacists talk to patients about medications, enabling them to try to minimize the nocebo effect, says Tinnermann. \nJournal reference: Science , DOI: 10.1126/science.aan1221", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:01:30.549+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6974f00c9b0e3c2fb3659a401e8ea1fff2cac493", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaoH1i.o5xyO3sb0JIUnROHNlzjpv8PKLrhE6xY3pUYFeHJUssRbpK1RQUgtV3gFc37HwNSA3eCiGyimqXXpzvDjc2qotNsIdKg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "", "title": "Side effects are worse when we think medication looks expensive", "title_full": "Side effects are worse when we think medication looks expensive", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.214, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/05152843/gettyimages-460900717.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6974f00c9b0e3c2fb3659a401e8ea1fff2cac493", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaoH1i.o5xyO3sb0JIUnROHNlzjpv8PKLrhE6xY3pUYFeHJUssRbpK1RQUgtV3gFc37HwNSA3eCiGyimqXXpzvDjc2qotNsIdKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Side effects are worse when we think medication looks expensive", "text": "5 Side effects are worse when we think medication looks expensive \nPeople have been found to experience stronger side effects when a treatment looks more expensive, according to a study of the nocebo effect ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T13:02:04.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be5f52d0d0fa9e589ecd8a6cb5112bb297e9bb3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaiN18l6HH_BJB6Syr55hEpQoBNvkKcsoiZ.YNUL6guFhAYxRZZRvfiG9JZHgEpHgcMr8uOIstL2LMPiC7d3vkkPFFOIPSTyAVQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/aviation", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Protein injection could prevent hair loss during chemotherapy", "title_full": "Protein injection could prevent hair loss during chemotherapy", "published": "2017-10-06T14:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/06104504/gettyimages-853406782.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be5f52d0d0fa9e589ecd8a6cb5112bb297e9bb3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaiN18l6HH_BJB6Syr55hEpQoBNvkKcsoiZ.YNUL6guFhAYxRZZRvfiG9JZHgEpHgcMr8uOIstL2LMPiC7d3vkkPFFOIPSTyAVQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T14:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Protein injection could prevent hair loss during chemotherapy", "text": "Protein injection could prevent hair loss during chemotherapy Hair-promoting hormone could work with all types of chemotherapy GeraldMercier/Getty By Alice Klein \nMice injected with a hair-promoting protein did not lose their hair during chemotherapy. The finding raises the hope that people undergoing cancer treatment can one day avoid this distressing side effect. \nHair loss is one of the most feared side effect s of chemotherapy. One study of women with breast cancer found that around 8 per cent had considered refusing treatment to save their locks. \nThere are few options for people receiving treatment. Scalp-cooling caps freeze and constrict blood vessels to stop chemo drugs from flowing into hair follicles. But they are expensive, work for only 50 per cent of people , extend treatment by two hours and cause discomfort and headaches. Advertisement \nOther people have experimented with using the hair loss treatment minoxidil during chemo, but a randomised controlled trial found no benefit . \nPart of the problem is our limited understanding of how chemotherapy damages hair follicles, says Sung-Jan Lin at National Taiwan University. \nTo address this, his team looked at the role of a protein called p53. This protein is activated during chemo and helps to suppress tumour growth, but may also suppress hair growth, since hair cells rapidly divide like tumour cells. A previous study found that mice missing the p53 protein did not shed their fur during chemo. Hair-promoting protein \nStudying p53, Lin and his colleagues have found that it blocks the activity of a hair-promoting protein called WNT3a. This gave them an idea: if you inject WNT3a directly into the scalp when administering chemo, will it stop hair loss? \nTo test this, they dosed mice with a common chemotherapy agent. Straight afterwards, they injected WNT3a-soaked beads under the surface of their skin. The microscopic beads \u2013 which were coloured blue \u2013 helped to keep the protein in a small area so the team could study its effects. \nSure enough, areas injected with the WNT3a-soaked beads were still coated with thick fur five days after chemo. In contrast, areas injected with untreated beads went bald. \nWhen the researchers examined patches of skin under the microscope, they found the protein treatment doubled the number of stem cells in the base of the hair follicles within the first day of injection, allowing more hairs to sprout. \nThe team is now working on adapting the treatment for use in people. It would not be practical or safe to inject the hair-promoting protein into the scalp in bead form, says Lin. \u201cWe might need to inject it into the scalp using arrays of fine needles so that many of the hair follicles can be covered,\u201d he says. His team is also testing compounds they have designed for activating WNT3a that could be spread over the scalp in cream or gel form. \nRichard de Boer, a medical oncologist at Epworth Centre in Melbourne, Australia, says the treatment could be a big help. While scalp cooling has led to many success stories, it doesn\u2019t work well for some types of chemotherapy, he says. \u201cNew hair-saving options that work with all chemotherapy regimens would be very welcome.\u201d Journal reference: Cancer Research , DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0667 \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T14:34:39.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b630372df18eb6ee7c8c890a1081d5212ee1d862", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_vBYbGbNk_OkABlzm5UMJC9cJlh83VpEKQcUj57tcaMgdsQt8MJ210-", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/climate-change", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "How to be Human: The reason we are so scarily hairy", "title_full": "How to be Human: The reason we are so scarily hairy", "published": "2017-10-06T15:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04180000/gettyimages-518337815.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b630372df18eb6ee7c8c890a1081d5212ee1d862", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_vBYbGbNk_OkABlzm5UMJC9cJlh83VpEKQcUj57tcaMgdsQt8MJ210-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T15:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to be Human: The reason we are so scarily hairy", "text": "4 October 2017 How to be Human : The reason we are so scarily hairy We might seem less hirsute than other beasts, but we\u2019re not, and this extract from New Scientist \u2019s book How to be Human reveals why our locks are so strange Hair everywhere Getty Images/Hero Images \nGood God, you\u2019re a hairy beast. You may not think you are, and compared with, say, a chimpanzee , you appear distinctly bald. But in fact your entire body (with the exception of the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet) is covered in hair. All told you have about 5 million follicles, about the same as chimps and other primates. \nBut the similarities stop there. Human hair is decidedly strange . Most of our body hair is so wispy and short as to be almost invisible, though in some places it is coarse and curly. Our head hair is almost uniquely long and flamboyant. We are pretty much the only animal to have hair that grows continuously for many years, and also to suffer the indignity of going bald. No wonder our relationship with our hair is a tangled one. A duet of hairs \nHuman hair comes in two basic types: terminal hair, which grows on the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes, and vellus hair, which is found everywhere else. Beyond that, the main difference between hair types is how long they grow for before the follicle runs out of steam. This is what determines their length and thickness. Advertisement \nHair follicles go through cycles of growth and dormancy . During the growth phase the hair grows continuously at about 0.4 millimetres per day, getting longer and thicker in the process. But at some point the hair-producing cells die off and growth stops. The hair falls out and the follicle goes dormant for around six months before sprouting new hair-producing cells and entering a new growth phase. \nThe length of the growth phase is controlled by hormones . Leg hairs grow for about two months, which is why they are short and fine. Armpit hairs make it to six months, but head hairs grow non-stop for six years or more. That means head hair can theoretically grow to almost a metre in length. \nIdeas abound as to why evolution has endowed us with such a unique combination of hair types. The leading one is that when our bipedal ancestors moved out of the forests and onto the searing heat of the savannah, they needed to keep their bodies cool while also sheltering their big brains from the sun. Body hair receded, removing an unnecessary insulating layer and also allowing the skin to be cooled by sweating. Hair loss was also presumably aided by technological innovations such as clothes, fire and cave-dwelling, which lessened the importance of fur for keeping warm at night. Head hair, meanwhile, became thicker and more luxuriant, protecting our ancestors\u2019 brains from the midday sun, and also retaining heat in the cold. \nGenetic evidence suggests that we became furless around 1.7 million years ago. Around this time our ancestor Homo erectus was living on the baking savannah, which supports the thermoregulation hypothesis. Look! No parasites \nBut it is not the only possibility. We may also have lost body hair to improve our ability to identify others and to make communication easier, or to resist disease, since fur is a prime habitat for parasites. There\u2019s also sexual selection, which was Charles Darwin \u2018s preferred explanation. For whatever reason, the least hairy of our ancestors were considered the most attractive and so produced more offspring. Hair-free skin may have been a billboard to advertise good health and hence attract mates \u2013 a sexual come-on saying, \u201cLook how unblemished and parasite-free I am.\u201d \nSexual selection could also explain our head hair. Most people find a strong, healthy head of hair attractive. Indeed, precisely because our head hair needs so much care, it makes a perfect hoarding upon which to advertise social and sexual status. Grooming is time-consuming, and so having well-groomed hair shows you are resourceful and have good social contacts. If this is correct, then the main function of head hair is to be cut and styled for maximum impact. This might explain why lank, unkempt locks are the mark of the social pariah. Prehistoric styling \nSome of the most ancient figurines do have coiffed hair. The oldest known three-dimensional representation of a human, the 25,000-year-old ivory Venus of Brassempouy, has elegant shoulder-length hair. And hair products are nothing new either. The 2300-year-old Clonycavan Man, discovered in a bog in County Meath, Ireland, was wearing hair gel made of plant oils and pine resin. \nHair may also have been used to signal group identity. Throughout the ages and across cultures, we have used hairstyles as a mark of membership: think Roundheads, Rastafarians and rockabillies. \nEnough about the hair on your head. Pubic hair is possibly even more unusual. Most primates have finer hair around their genitals than on the rest of their body, but adult humans are the exact opposite. \nThere\u2019s no accepted explanation. One possibility is that since thicker hair coincides with regions where we have apocrine (scent) glands, it may serve to concentrate or waft odours that signal sexual maturity. Pubic hair may also protect the genitals during sex and at other times \u2013 reducing chafing while walking, for example \u2013 and also helps keep our most sensitive regions warm and free of draughts. \nWhatever it evolved for, many people now subject the hair in their pubic regions to as much grooming as the hair on their heads, while ruthlessly removing it from the rest of their bodies. Hairless we ain\u2019t \u2013 but not for lack of trying. Baldylocks \nPity the human male: along with the stump-tailed macaque, he is the only primate to routinely suffer the indignity of a receding hairline. \nBy age 30, a quarter of men have started to go bald, and by 45, half have. Male pattern baldness has a predictable trajectory: hair begins to disappear on the temples, then on the top of the head, before staging a general retreat that leaves the entire pate hairless. \nExcept that it doesn\u2019t. Baldness is not about having no hair; it is about having the wrong sort of hair. Bald heads have just as many follicles as any other \u2013 about 100,000 \u2013 but the follicles have ceased to function properly and only produce colourless and wispy hairs. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cWhy are humans so hairy?\u201d \n\u2022 This is an extract from How To Be Human , our new illustrated book about the most amazing species on the planet (John Murray) \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T15:16:36.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d81fdc7017035d6ab9fe3e1b8a3114d21d883d32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLauSPph2fSS_FNCYr1OP5t7jY0Z4L27YTC0yDXcqLC5CojPFd._652kFe8Hb0fNuRJDnvQLIrPTVNtz55gOvhrhFEiOzQzbEHmA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/food-drink", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "We can\u2019t ever know whether or not our universe is a simulation", "title_full": "We can\u2019t ever know whether or not our universe is a simulation", "published": "2017-10-06T16:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/06131144/z1069_007.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d81fdc7017035d6ab9fe3e1b8a3114d21d883d32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLauSPph2fSS_FNCYr1OP5t7jY0Z4L27YTC0yDXcqLC5CojPFd._652kFe8Hb0fNuRJDnvQLIrPTVNtz55gOvhrhFEiOzQzbEHmA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T16:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "We can\u2019t ever know whether or not our universe is a simulation", "text": "We can\u2019t ever know whether or not our universe is a simulation Millennium Images, UK/Brighitta Moser-Clark \nAre we living in a simulation?

But even the fittest among us suffer in thin air: the lower oxygen content at altitude can lead to cognitive effects, including memory loss and attention difficulties. \nThere is little you can do to prevent these symptoms other than acclimatise \u2013 but this takes time and doesn\u2019t always work. A drug called oxiracetam might be the answer. Advertisement Up and down \nShengLi Hu at the Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China, and her colleagues took men from the military up to 4000 metres above sea level. \nAll of the men lived in towns around 1800 metres above sea level. During the study, they spent eight days at this altitude, before climbing for three days to reach 4000 metres, where they stayed for up to a month. \nTwenty participants took 800mg of oxiracetam three times per day for the first 15 days of the study, while another 20 men received no intervention. The men performed tests of attention and memory at the start and end of the study and 20 days in, by which time they had been at 4000 metres for nine days. \nWhile all participants experienced a drop in cognitive ability at 4000 metres, those who took oxiracetam showed a much smaller decline than the control group. \nUsing a technique that measures the brain\u2019s response to sounds, the team found that those who took the drug also showed less of a decline in the speed at which they could process sensory information. Going with the flow \nBlood flow measurements indicated that at high altitudes, certain parts of the cerebral circulatory system contracted and dilated in a way that promoted blood flow to the brain stem. This isn\u2019t surprising, since the brain stem plays a critical role in the maintenance of basic vital signs. \nThe team also found that the brain stem received blood at the expense of brain areas responsible for more advanced cognitive functions. But in people who took oxiracetam, more arteries dilated, so blood flow throughout the brain was increased. This may be how the drug seems to lessen cognitive problems associated with low oxygen. It is yet to be seen whether diverting the blood in this way could have any negative effects in the long run. \n\u201cThe results are striking and imply that oxiracetam may be beneficial for helping to mitigate cognitive deficits caused by altitude,\u201d says Timothy Hales at the University of Dundee, UK. \nDespite a wealth of people admitting to taking numerous kinds of smart drugs to improve their memory or focus , there is little research on oxiracetam in healthy people. In a single study in older adults with dementia , the drug appeared to help improve performance in some memory-associated tasks. \nOxiracetam is not licensed for medical use in the UK, but the drug is known to be a mild stimulant, says Hales. \u201cCoca leaves have been used by native Andeans for centuries to overcome altitude sickness and this is attributed to their modest cocaine content. So perhaps it is not surprising that benefit can be derived from another, albeit mild, stimulant.\u201d Journal reference: Brain and Behaviour , DOI: 10.1002/brb3.762 \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T18:58:21.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75dfb95720aa66141c45d8dbc744910c797ee798", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLajSZl6._CchIUni_8gTMBIPbDWRDVCUg97Wq3Z66FZ4VVCsOV4vI8SZpRtB17kd2fX0vS6sg4WKDzBrng7T6rMpCb.r6C5xFHw--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Lunar volcanoes and lava lakes gave the early moon an atmosphere", "title_full": "Lunar volcanoes and lava lakes gave the early moon an atmosphere", "published": "2017-10-06T20:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/06171934/a17_m_2444.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75dfb95720aa66141c45d8dbc744910c797ee798", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLajSZl6._CchIUni_8gTMBIPbDWRDVCUg97Wq3Z66FZ4VVCsOV4vI8SZpRtB17kd2fX0vS6sg4WKDzBrng7T6rMpCb.r6C5xFHw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T20:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lunar volcanoes and lava lakes gave the early moon an atmosphere", "text": "Lunar volcanoes and lava lakes gave the early moon an atmosphere Atmosphere is long gone NASA By Jeff Hecht \nIf you travelled back in time 3.5 billion years and looked up at the night sky, you would have seen an atmosphere around the moon. Though today it retains only a few tenuous wisps of atmosphere, new calculations show that massive volcanic eruptions released enough hot gas to create one that took 70 million years to leak away. \nAstronomers had thought the moon was dry as a bone, yet we recently learned that the magma ocean covering the newborn moon 4.5 billion years ago released hot vapours of sodium and silica that formed a short-lived atmosphere . Now it seems a second lunar atmosphere developed 3.5 billion years ago as a result of eruptions flooding a large crater to form Mare Imbrium, a lava plain on the near side of the moon. \nStarting nearly a decade ago, studies using sensitive new instruments revealed volatile material embedded in lunar volcanic glass collected by Apollo astronauts . The glass came from the dark lunar basins and hinted that the large volcanic eruptions that formed them between 3.8 and 3.1 billion years ago also emitted vast amounts of gas. Advertisement Dune on the moon \nNow Debra Needham and David Kring at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, have calculated these emissions based on the estimated volumes of the lava flows. The largest emission was the roughly 10 trillion tonnes of gas that erupted along with the 5.3 million cubic kilometres of lava that filled the Imbrium basin. That would have raised lunar air pressure to about 1 per cent that of modern Earth, or 1.5 times the density of today\u2019s Martian atmosphere. \n\u201cIf you had any temperature gradient on the lunar surface, there would have been wind,\u201d Needham says. With dust on the surface and enough wind to transport it, she adds, it could have been like \u201c Dune on the moon\u201d. But within 70 million years, all the atmospheric gas escaped or froze out in the polar regions, and because it all happened so long ago, no evidence of these winds would remain. \nJames Day at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California says this atmosphere formation process could account for the distribution of water and other volatiles on the surface of the moon and their loss from its interior. It could also help us understand how planetary atmospheres form, he says.

Any disturbance that leads to the mothers separating from the pups is \u201cbad news\u201d for the baby seals. \nGoodman with Sue Wilson and colleagues gathered data from observers who travelled on 39 icebreaker trips from 2006 to 2013 in the northern Caspian Sea. This sea is a major oil and gas drilling site. Advertisement \nIt is also the only home of the Caspian seals , which are found nowhere else. Caspian seal mothers give birth late in January on the open ice, and suckle their pups for about five weeks. The pups are born with white coats similar to ringed seals, and are vulnerable while still dependent on their mothers for nutrition. The mothers often choose thick, solid ice, with features like ice folds to protect the pups from wind. \nGoodman identified 184 occasions on which icebreakers came within 10 metres of a mother and pup. The mother typically fled and tried to take her pup with her, but sometimes left it behind. In one case, a mother temporarily abandoned a newborn pup. Because the icebreakers were moving, it was not always possible to tell what eventually happened. However, in at least two cases mother and pup ended up a long way apart, and may have lost each other. \nIf the pups get knocked into the water by icebreakers or the waves they create, they can get hypothermic, says Goodman. Their coats aren\u2019t yet heavy enough to withstand the cold water. \u201cThat can be very costly in terms of energy, or in the worst case it can lead to the death of the pup,\u201d he says. Save the baby seals \nGoodman says the best way to avoid such problems is to send fewer icebreakers through seal habitats during breeding season. When such transits are unavoidable, ships might avoid seal hotspots. Finally, ships could carry trained observers to advise the crew on how to avoid seals. \nUnfortunately, icebreakers don\u2019t always have a lot of flexibility in their movement, says Erin Moreland at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The problem is compounded by low visibility at night. \nInstead, Moreland says drones might offer more advance warning of what\u2019s ahead. She has also seen ships equipped with thermal imaging. \nIt\u2019s unclear how significant the effects of icebreakers are for Caspian seal populations, Goodman says. He has since briefed the Kazakh company that operates the icebreakers. \u201cThey responded well to the advice that was given to them.\u201d \nCaspian seals are considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature \u2013 mainly because they get caught up in sturgeon nets from illegal fishing operations, which have proliferated since the collapse of the Soviet Union. \u201cIf you ask me what to do to protect Caspian seals, it would be to sort out the by-catch problem first and foremost,\u201d says Goodman. \nThe study implies that related species, like ring seals in the Arctic, could also be affected by icebreakers, says Dan Costa at the University of California, Santa Cruz. But the risk is likely to be lower for these species. \u201cThe difference in the Arctic is that the species are just much more numerous,\u201d he says. \nHowever, shipping traffic in the Arctic is increasing and viable habitat for Arctic seals will shrink due to issues like climate change. That means the icebreakers might ultimately pose a problem for those seals too, says Costa.

The discovery that our characters change is unnerving, but embrace it and it can be empowering Daniel Stolle By Emma Young \nAS A child, Wendy Johnson was extremely shy. \u201cOne of my report cards said: \u2018Wendy is so shy, it\u2019s painful to watch!\u201d She\u2019s not like that now. \u201cI am definitely a person who learned to overcome overt shyness,\u201d says Johnson, a psychologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK. She says shyness is an indicator of a low level of extroversion, a key measure of personality, which she studies. So does this mean Johnson has changed her personality? Undoubtedly, she says. \nThat answer might surprise you. Most of us consider our personality to be an integral and unchanging part of who we are \u2013 perhaps the essence of that thing we call the self. In 1887, psychologist William James went so far as to argue that it becomes \u201cset like plaster\u201d by the age of 30. His idea stuck. Psychologists have long debated how to measure personality, settling eventually on the \u201cbig five\u201d traits (see \u201c What are you like? \u201c). But at least they were able to agree on a definition: personality refers to an individual\u2019s thought patterns and behaviours, which tend to persist over time. Now mounting evidence is undermining that notion. Personality is far more mutable than we thought. That may be a little unsettling. But it\u2019s also good news for the almost 90 per cent of us who wish our personalities were at least a little different . \nThere\u2019s no doubt that personality is partly genetic. What\u2019s less certain is how much is down to our genes and how much to nurture .

A recent closed-door colloquium held at a top British university brought together two dozen leading AI researchers and a group of illustrious humanities scholars to address philosophical questions raised by AI. \nIn the event, however, the two contingents struggled to find common ground. The engineers described their work in precise, dense terms, mostly skipping over its implications. The scholars, too, critiqued the descriptions rather than tackling the implications; some seemed affronted by the very idea of thinking machines. Advertisement \nThat\u2019s a pity, because we really need fresh thinking on AI. Public discussion is dominated by scary stories about the elimination of human workers \u2013 or of humans, full stop. Meanwhile, machine learning applications are quietly becoming integral to our daily lives, with little consideration of the consequences (see \u201c How scaremongering steps us asking the right questions about AI \u201c). \nThose consequences are myriad, poorly understood, and evolving rapidly. AIs are now involved in many decisions that significantly affect our lives. But there is also growing evidence that they aren\u2019t necessarily ready to shoulder all the responsibilities they are being given. \nMachine learning alone may be fine when it comes to optimising, say, your power usage. But in less clear-cut tasks, such as healthcare, the combination of human and machine can be more effective.

Visualisation by Andrey Kravtsov By Leah Crane \nThe missing links between galaxies have finally been found. This is the first detection of the roughly half of the normal matter in our universe \u2013 protons, neutrons and electrons \u2013 unaccounted for by previous observations of stars, galaxies and other bright objects in space. \nYou have probably heard about the hunt for dark matter , a mysterious substance thought to permeate the universe, the effects of which we can see through its gravitational pull. But our models of the universe also say there should be about twice as much ordinary matter out there, compared with what we have observed so far. \nTwo separate teams found the missing matter \u2013 made of particles called baryons rather than dark matter \u2013 linking galaxies together through filaments of hot, diffuse gas . Advertisement \n\u201cThe missing baryon problem is solved,\u201d says Hideki Tanimura at the Institute of Space Astrophysics in Orsay, France, leader of one of the groups. The other team was led by Anna de Graaff at the University of Edinburgh, UK. Read more: Strangely familiar \u2013 Is dark matter normal stuff in disguise? \nBecause the gas is so tenuous and not quite hot enough for X-ray telescopes to pick up, nobody had been able to see it before. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no sweet spot \u2013 no sweet instrument that we\u2019ve invented yet that can directly observe this gas,\u201d says Richard Ellis at University College London. \u201cIt\u2019s been purely speculation until now.\u201d \nSo the two groups had to find another way to definitively show that these threads of gas are really there. \nBoth teams took advantage of a phenomenon called the Sunyaev-Zel\u2019dovich effect that occurs when light left over from the big bang passes through hot gas. As the light travels, some of it scatters off the electrons in the gas, leaving a dim patch in the cosmic microwave background \u2013 our snapshot of the remnants from the birth of the cosmos. Stack \u2018em up \nIn 2015, the Planck satellite created a map of this effect throughout the observable universe. Because the tendrils of gas between galaxies are so diffuse, the dim blotches they cause are far too slight to be seen directly on Planck\u2019s map. \nBoth teams selected pairs of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that were expected to be connected by a strand of baryons. They stacked the Planck signals for the areas between the galaxies, making the individually faint strands detectable en masse. \nTanimura\u2019s team stacked data on 260,000 pairs of galaxies , and de Graaff\u2019s group used over a million pairs. Both teams found definitive evidence of gas filaments between the galaxies. Tanimura\u2019s group found they were almost three times denser than the mean for normal matter in the universe, and de Graaf\u2019s group found they were six times denser \u2013 confirmation that the gas in these areas is dense enough to form filaments. \n\u201cWe expect some differences because we are looking at filaments at different distances,\u201d says Tanimura. \u201cIf this factor is included, our findings are very consistent with the other group.\u201d Read more: Missing matter \u2013 Where did half the universe go? \nFinally finding the extra baryons that have been predicted by decades of simulations validates some of our assumptions about the universe. \n\u201cEverybody sort of knows that it has to be there, but this is the first time that somebody \u2013 two different groups, no less \u2013 has come up with a definitive detection,\u201d says Ralph Kraft at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. \n\u201cThis goes a long way toward showing that many of our ideas of how galaxies form and how structures form over the history of the universe are pretty much correct,\u201d he says.

A high-tech paint that actually cools when exposed to sunlight can provide a better way to chill buildings \u2013 and perhaps even solve the long-standing problem of cooling things in space. \nIn hot weather, electricity consumption soars as people turn on the air conditioning, pushing the grid to its limits and raising energy bills. Now Yaron Shenhav and his colleagues from SolCold, a firm based in Herzliya, Israel, have come up with an alternative that doesn\u2019t require electricity. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting a layer of ice on your rooftop which is thicker when there is more sun,\u201d he says. \nThe technology is based on the counterintuitive principle of laser cooling, in which hitting specially designed materials with a laser can cool them by up to 150\u00b0C. It works because molecules in these materials absorb photons whose light is of one frequency while spontaneously re-emitting higher-frequency photons, which also carry more energy. Since energy is lost, the temperature of the material is reduced in the process. Advertisement \nMounting lasers on your roof wouldn\u2019t be very practical, though, so Shenhav wanted to see if he could tweak the technique to make it work with sunlight instead. \u201cHeat from a building could be absorbed and re-emitted as light,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as the sun is shining on it, it would be continuously cooled.\u201d \nThe problem is that the sun\u2019s spectrum is much broader than that of laser light \u2013 a focused beam with a narrow range of frequencies. So the team had to create a material that could do the same trick using several frequencies of scattered light. They came up with a paint made up of two layers: an outer layer that filters out some of the sun\u2019s rays and an inner one that does the heat-to-light conversion, cooling itself below the ambient temperature. \nSo far, the material has been successfully tested in the lab, where the researchers have found that the effect is more pronounced on metal roofs than on concrete, and works best over rooms with low ceilings. Simulations show that a room on the top floor will feel up to 10\u00b0C cooler than with the paint applied if applied to a roof of a house than without the coating . The team will conduct pilot tests on buildings within two years. \nPeople already use white cooling paints to scatter and reduce the amount of heat buildings absorb. However, they can\u2019t actively reduce the temperature in the building, whereas SolCold\u2019s paint can, says Eran Zahavy at the Israel Institute of Biological Research, who was not involved in the research. Cut the air conditioning \nThe new paint isn\u2019t cheap, costing about $300 to coat 100 square metres. Shenhav and his team think the early adopters will be large commercial buildings like shopping malls and stadiums. There, the coating could lower energy consumption by up to 60 per cent, massively reducing bills and carbon emissions. \nIt could have other knock-on environmental benefits as well. The continuous use of air conditioning in already hot areas like Phoenix, Arizona , creates urban heat islands which have been linked to steadily rising temperatures in such cities. With the new paint, \u201cbuildings would be able to install much smaller air-conditioning units,\u201d says Shenav. \nThe paint\u2019s use isn\u2019t limited to this planet: it could solve the significant challenge of how to cool objects in space. That might seem counterintuitive given the frigid temperatures there, but the problem is that there is no air to carry heat away from an object. Currently, the ISS uses reflective fabric to ward off radiation from the sun, and internal heat exchangers to get rid of excess heat produced by equipment. \u201cWith our technology, heat is transferred through light,\u201d says Shenhav. \u201cSpace applications are a big market for us.\u201d \nThe team will be presenting their work later this month at the Hello Tomorrow technology summit in Paris. \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yaron shenhav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eran zahavy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandrine ceurstemont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shenav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shenhav", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "israel institute of biological research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solcold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iss", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "herzliya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T15:26:46.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fce67cd69c628a8ccc66b8f833855c84abbb246", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLat3_cHReQM6jF7h38VfxWOAQDEnf5AWgqqJZbPPF8RRzP..q2HmZHRLqW8w.7i91I8uZV_PoLLCUm8hfRyNd5WBgKfgqGuwOMQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/climate-change", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Exploding stars could have kick-started our ancestors\u2019 evolution", "title_full": "Exploding stars could have kick-started our ancestors\u2019 evolution", "published": "2017-10-09T16:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09135717/gettyimages-158411811.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 169, "comments": 0, "shares": 169}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5fce67cd69c628a8ccc66b8f833855c84abbb246", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLat3_cHReQM6jF7h38VfxWOAQDEnf5AWgqqJZbPPF8RRzP..q2HmZHRLqW8w.7i91I8uZV_PoLLCUm8hfRyNd5WBgKfgqGuwOMQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-09T16:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Exploding stars could have kick-started our ancestors\u2019 evolution", "text": "Exploding stars could have kick-started our ancestors\u2019 evolution Great news for grasses Frans Lanting/Mint Images/Getty By Colin Barras \nWas the rise of humankind written in the stars? A nearby star exploding 8 million years ago might have triggered more frequent lightning on Earth. Wildfires ignited by that lightning could help explain the rise of east African savannahs \u2013 which many researchers think provided a vital backdrop for the early evolution of hominins. \nThe rise of African savannahs, beginning about 8 million years ago, has long been a mystery to biologists. They are dominated by plants called C4 grasses \u2013 but those grasses appeared 20 million years ago, long before they rose to dominance. Some botanists now wonder whether the trigger was a spate of wildfires 8 million years ago . Grasses bounce back quickly after a wildfire while trees are slower to recover, so frequent wildfires would have favoured the expansion of savannahs . \nNow researchers led by Brian Thomas at Washburn University in Kansas, Georg Feulner at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and Adrian Melott at the University of Kansas have provided a possible explanation for the surge in wildfires 8 million years ago. \nDeep-sea sediments of that age contain a lot of iron-60, which is produced in massive stars. Its presence strongly suggests there was at least one nearby supernova at the time . \nThe team says a pulse of high-energy cosmic rays from the supernova must have swept across Earth.

The World Anti-Doping Agency has extended its 2003 ban on \u201cgene doping\u201d to include all forms of gene editing \u2013 but it is not clear the agency has the means to enforce this ban. \nWADA already bans the use of genetically modified cells and gene therapy if they have \u201cthe potential to enhance sport performance\u201d. From 2018 , the list will also include \u201cgene editing agents designed to alter genome sequences and/or the transcriptional or epigenetic regulation of gene expression\u201d. \nGene editing involves tweaking existing genes, rather than adding whole new ones to a person\u2019s body. The field is advancing incredibly fast thanks to the development in 2012 of an easy editing method called CRISPR. The first human trials of the method are already underway . Advertisement \nWhether people who have medical treatment involving such methods will be able to later compete in sports depends on the nature of the treatment, says WADA spokesperson Maggie Durand. \n\u201cGenerally, performance enhancement implies enhancement beyond a return to normal, although you may appreciate that this is not always easy to prove definitively,\u201d she says. \nIn cases where a treatment is specifically banned by WADA, athletes will be able to apply for an exemption when gene editing is used for therapeutic use. Detection problem \nBut how will WADA be able to detect people who have tried using gene editing to get a competitive advantage? \nThe agency did not answer New Scientist \u2019s question about whether it has the technical capacity to detect any cheats who resort to gene editing. \nIt certainly won\u2019t be easy. The agency first started developing ways to detect gene doping more than a decade ago, but only began testing for one kind of gene therapy last year. \nBlood samples from athletes who competed in the 2016 Rio Olympics are now being tested for added copies of a gene coding for EPO, a hormone that boost red blood cell levels . No positive results have yet been announced. \nGene editing should be even harder to detect than conventional gene therapies like this. Gene editing should make it possible to make tiny alterations to DNA in existing genes, or to just temporarily boost or switch off the activity of particular genes. What\u2019s more, these tweaks can be restricted to specific tissues such as muscle, meaning the changes may not show up in blood tests. \nIn theory, the \u201cbiological passports\u201d introduced by WADA in 2009 should reveal any unexpected changes in an athlete\u2019s body, even if gene doping itself cannot be detected. But any would-be cheats smart enough to resort to gene editing may be able to find ways round this. \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael le page", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maggie durand", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world anti-doping agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T17:31:23.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05bb73189948d928e233204495d945913729b54a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaq0lzAfCN1eTyVMFxpiC1TexoQz.doSnbK_LZUbgyWOHapSkeK5c9Q0tde49h021CDcZY.f8mcpvJll2rct0DMK10SpGMYJxXw--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/climate-change", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Nanoflares in the sun\u2019s plasma may cause its scalding atmosphere", "title_full": "Nanoflares in the sun\u2019s plasma may cause its scalding atmosphere", "published": "2017-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09112143/c0374673-total_solar_eclipse_2017.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 83, "comments": 0, "shares": 83}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 10}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05bb73189948d928e233204495d945913729b54a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaq0lzAfCN1eTyVMFxpiC1TexoQz.doSnbK_LZUbgyWOHapSkeK5c9Q0tde49h021CDcZY.f8mcpvJll2rct0DMK10SpGMYJxXw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nanoflares in the sun\u2019s plasma may cause its scalding atmosphere", "text": "Nanoflares in the sun\u2019s plasma may cause its scalding atmosphere Tiny eruptions may heat up the solar corona DR JUERG ALEAN/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY \nPopcorn blasts of fire in the sun\u2019s atmosphere may solve a longstanding mystery. New observations show parts of the solar corona at scalding temperatures with no visible heat sources \u2013 suggesting that lots of small explosions may be hotting things up. \nThe state of the corona has been a source of mystery since 1869, when astronomers detected an unknown material during a solar eclipse. When the material was later identified as iron that reached more than a million degrees centigrade, it posed a problem: the sun\u2019s surface can only reach 5500\u00b0C, so how could the plasma above be so much hotter ? \nThe excess heat may come from nanoflares \u2013 small, staccato eruptions of plasma released by kinks in the sun\u2019s magnetic field, says Lindsay Glesener at the University of Minnesota in Twin Cities and her colleagues, including team leader Shin-nosuke Ishikawa at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in Kanagawa. Advertisement \nIndividually, nanoflares would be beyond the vision of current technology, but Glesener\u2019s team may have detected them in aggregate. \n\u201cMaybe you can see the total effects of a [small] flare and all of its friends added together,\u201d says Glesener . \nThe team\u2019s data comes from FOXSI-2, the second flight of a rocket called the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager. The craft launched from New Mexico on 11 December 2014, and spent just 6.5 minutes staring at different regions of the sun before returning to Earth. During the mission, the team made decisions on where to point its instruments in real time. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hectic,\u201d Glesener says. \nOver an active region of the sun with no obvious flares , the team saw 15 high-energy X-ray photons that were likely produced by material at 10 million degrees. If the corona had a uniform, steady heat source \u2013 as alternative theories suggest, with magnetic waves carrying the heat up from below \u2013 plasma would not get that warm. \n\u201cI was really excited to see this,\u201d says Amy Winebarger at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \nBoth Winebarger and Glesener count this as strong evidence that nanoflares exist, but think that more study is needed to close the case on coronal heating. \u201cThe next step is we have to confront the models with this,\u201d Winebarger says. \nThe next FOXSI flight in August 2018 may also help by finding more hot pockets of coronal plasma, as could the existing NuSTAR X-ray satellite, Glesener says. \nJournal Reference: Nature Astronomy , DOI: 10.1038/s41550-017-0269-z \nRead more: Sun \u2018smoke rings\u2019 give clue to solar wind mystery \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amy winebarger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsay glesener", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shin-nosuke ishikawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juerg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glesener", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winebarger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "japan aerospace exploration agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall space flight center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kanagawa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T19:22:03.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45058939bf4cdb534a3d8437a3840394d525d3fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLavWohkVHGmpGeMYW53Osd2wUNzoepEqL5wDqlxWhtUtq6dJtnKnKoIrNlBAxDy7uVOhx3qn3rX094Ly2cztRXIvyBBq89m5N4g--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/news", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Kuwait\u2019s plans for mandatory DNA database have been cancelled", "title_full": "Kuwait\u2019s plans for mandatory DNA database have been cancelled", "published": "2017-10-09T19:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09161936/gettyimages-464366916.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 100, "comments": 0, "shares": 100}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 25}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45058939bf4cdb534a3d8437a3840394d525d3fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLavWohkVHGmpGeMYW53Osd2wUNzoepEqL5wDqlxWhtUtq6dJtnKnKoIrNlBAxDy7uVOhx3qn3rX094Ly2cztRXIvyBBq89m5N4g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-09T19:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kuwait\u2019s plans for mandatory DNA database have been cancelled", "text": "Kuwait\u2019s plans for mandatory DNA database have been cancelled Personal liberty at stake YASSER AL-ZAYYAT/AFP/Getty Images By Andy Coghlan \nKuwait has revoked the world\u2019s first law requiring all citizens and visitors to submit samples of their DNA. \nPassed in 2015, the law was challenged last year by lawyers in Kuwait.

This convergence suggests that it may someday be possible to predict how many species live in a particular habitat, and even to identify the holes left by missing species. \nFor more than half a century, ecologists have tended to describe ecological roles, or \u201cniches\u201d, as though they were properties of individual species. For example, chameleons are camouflaged, tree-dwelling lizards that ambush insects, while horned lizards are ground-dwelling desert creatures that eat ants and bear protective spines. The diversity can seem overwhelming. \nBut Eric Pianka , an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Texas in Austin, has long wondered whether there might only be a certain, limited set of niches. Advertisement \nTo test the idea, Pianka and his colleague Laurie Vitt at the University of Oklahoma decided to pool their decades of experience studying lizards in the field. \u201cOur entire life, basically, has been going out and collecting data on lizards,\u201d says Vitt. \u201cSo we have a huge data set.\u201d \nThe pair looked at 134 species on four continents. For each one, they examined more than 50 features of their niches, such as habitat type, hunting style, reproductive output and defences against predators. Then, with colleagues, they crunched the numbers. \nOver and over, they saw pairs of unrelated lizards converge on similar niches. Out of the 134 species, 100 belonged to a convergent pair, far more than could have happened by chance. For example, African chameleons have ecological equivalents in the Americas called bush anoles , and Australia\u2019s thorny devil fills almost precisely the same niche as North America\u2019s horned lizards. \nIf lizards could evolve into an unlimited number of niches, this convergence would be unlikely. Instead, their result suggests that lizards are constrained to live particular lifestyles. For instance, there are no marine lizards or lizards that behave like elephants. \u201cThere\u2019s only a certain number of ways to be a lizard,\u201d says Pianka. Laws of nature \n\u201cThis is beautiful,\u201d says evolutionary biologist George McGhee at Rutgers University in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing the number of species that have converged into ecological roles.\u201d \nEcologists could apply the same approach to other groups, like birds or rodents. However, each group is likely to have its own unique set of niche features \u2013 for example, many birds make long migrations, and some rodents hibernate \u2013 which would complicate the analysis, says Pianka. \nThe limited number of niches implies that ecologists may someday be able to construct a \u201ctable of niches\u201d, somewhat analogous to chemistry\u2019s periodic table of elements. \u201cIf we constructed this table, and we thought it was fairly complete, then we could go into places and look at the structure of the habitat, the temperatures and so on, and say \u2018this place ought to be able to support 10 species of lizards\u2019,\u201d says Vitt. Ecologists could then predict far more about the natural world than they can today. \nMoreover, such a table would highlight \u201cempty\u201d niches where species ought to occur but do not. These gaps could point to niches that were once filled by a species that has died out, but so recently that evolution has not yet refilled the niche, says Vitt. \nHowever, the findings do not necessarily mean that extinct species can be easily replaced by their ecological equivalents, says Vitt. Such \u201cplug and play\u201d replacements have been attempted on Indian Ocean islands, where giant tortoises wiped out by human activity have been substituted by tortoises from other islands . The problem is, even if the new species fills the same niche, it may respond differently to competitors, predators and prey \u2013 leading to unpredictable changes in the ecosystem.

Nudging relies on subtle psychological ploys to guide consumers to make choices that are more beneficial for themselves or for society. Advertisement \nOne example of nudging is redrafting the default choice for organ donation , so that people have to consciously opt out of donating rather than taking the trouble to opt in. \nAnother is making pension contributions the default option for employees, subtly encouraging them to save for the future rather than squander their salaries on instant gratification. \nThe potential for nudging has proved so great that some governments, including those of the UK and the USA, have set up \u201cNudge Units\u201d to help push pro-environment, pro-saving and pro-health agendas. \nThaler\u2019s other major contribution was his studies of the limits to people\u2019s rationality. \n\u201cBy exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences and lack of self-control, [Thaler] has shown how these human traits systematically affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes,\u201d says the Royal Swedish Academy . \nAs an example of limited rationality, the academy cites the case of a taxi driver who stops working daily once a pre-set target for income is reached. According to Thaler, the driver could earn considerably more by working beyond the target on days when the target is met early, as there is more custom available, and stopping work early if demand is slack, even if the target isn\u2019t met. \nThaler\u2019s work also showed that people often take fairness into account when making economic decisions, even if it means paying more or suffering a personal cost for punishing others perceived as acting unfairly. For instance, consumers may decide against buying umbrellas even when it\u2019s raining hard if they can see that umbrella sellers have raised the price during rainy spells. \nThaler also coined the \u201cendowment effect\u201d, a phenomenon whereby people tend to value things they already own , or created, more highly than matching objects on open sale. \nAnd to help resolve the internal tension in everyone between short-term gratification and long-term planning, Thaler theorised that we all have a \u201cplanning\u201d self, and a \u201cdoing\u201d self, calling it the planner-doer phenomenon. Thaler realised, for example, that people would be more willing to contribute to occupational pensions if employees commit to allocating a portion of future salary increases to the pot, rather than from their existing salaries, another example of the \u201cnudge\u201d phenomenon.

Anton Petrus/Getty By Lakshmi Supriya \nAncient humans may have trekked out of Africa to escape arid climes. This is the result suggested by a record of climate in East Africa spanning the past 200,000 years. \n\u201cIt raises the possibility that drought, rather than rainy conditions, prompted early humans to migrate,\u201d says lead author Jessica Tierney at the University of Arizona. \nModern humans are widely agreed to have evolved in Africa and are thought to have migrated out 65,000 to 55,000 years ago. They may have left via East Africa and headed to Arabia, although this isn\u2019t settled. Advertisement \nPrevious studies showed that many parts of Africa, like the Sahara, have had many wet and dry periods. A marine core, collected from the Gulf of Aden off Africa\u2019s east coast in 1965, has sediments dating to 200,000 years ago. Analysing this allowed Tierney and her colleagues to construct an extended timeline of climate shifts in north-east Africa. \nThey focused on a chemical called alkenone that is made by marine algae, whose composition changes as the temperature of the sea surface alters. In this way, they determined temperatures every 1600 years, going back 200,000 years. \nThe team also created a rainfall record by analysing the wax of leaves blown out to sea and buried in the sediment. Plants make subtly different leaf wax depending on rainfall. Changing climes \nBetween 130,000 and 80,000 years ago, the team found that north-east Africa was warm and wet, in line with previous evidence . At this time, humans were expanding throughout Africa, leading some to suggest that the green Sahara made it easier for people to move out into Europe and Asia. \nBut between 75,000 and 55,000 years ago, the climate turned dry and cold \u2013 and genetic studies suggest this is when the major out-of-Africa migration happened . So instead of a comfortable climate making it easy to leave Africa, Tierney says, maybe the difficult climate made the move necessary. \nThe study successfully ties together all the disparate lines of evidence about past Saharan climates, says Nicholas Drake of King\u2019s College London. \nHowever, the interpretation is less clear because the date of the out-of-Africa migration is highly contentious. Two recent studies found evidence that modern humans were in Sumatra at least 63,000 years ago and in Australia by 65,000 years ago , which implies an earlier exit. Other studies hint at multiple waves of dispersa l dating back 130,000 years. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can really say that dispersal coincided with North Africa becoming drier and colder,\u201d says archaeologist Huw Groucutt at the University of Oxford.

This is the first time astronomers have caught one in the act and it could help us better understand odd cosmic objects known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). \nAGN occur when an enormous black hole \u2013 often with the mass of a billion suns \u2013 finds itself in the centre of a galaxy. As large clouds of gas and dust fall into the black hole, they spin around its edge and experience extreme forces and friction. Heated to millions of degrees, the material can shine brighter than all the other stars in the galaxy combined. But once the gas and dust get used up, the black hole goes dark. \nInactive AGNs sometimes show evidence of past meals \u2013 clouds of material that were shot out of the galactic centre along with the intense radiation, lingering for hundreds of thousands of years until they dissipate. Advertisement \nNow Julie Comerford of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and her colleagues have spotted two separate outbursts in a galaxy called J1354+1327, located about 900 million light years away. \nThe earlier eruption resulted in a patch of bright dust south of the galactic center that has spread into a feathery cone approximately 30,000 light years long. A later explosion generated a compact dome of material located about 1300 light years north of the black hole. \n\u201cIt solidifies the way we thought AGN flickering works,\u201d says Comerford. J1354+1327 and its smaller companion galaxy may have previously collided, a long-suspected trigger for AGN activity Comerford et al \nBecause all they see are snapshots of activity, astronomers have wondered if AGN events occur in long blasts that last tens of millions of years, or if they are more rapid fire. Comerford and her team estimate that the two outbursts happened roughly 100,000 years apart, relatively fast for cosmic processes, confirming results seen in some computer models. \nThe work fits with our simulations, says Travis Fischer of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who was not part of the study. \u201cHaving an actual set of data points of what are possible reignition times is very valuable.\u201d \nJ1354+1327\u2019s double snack attack was spotted because material from the later eruption is currently pummeling into interstellar gas and dust, generating bright shockwaves. Knowing how to now find this signature, the team hopes to discover other reigniting AGN. \nJ1354+1327 also has a smaller companion galaxy located about 40,000 light years from it. The two galaxies appear to be connected by a bridge of stars, suggesting that they previously collided, a long-suspected trigger for AGN activity. The interaction could have thrown material at the central black hole, powering one or more of its feeding periods. \nSuch results have significance closer to home. Our own Milky Way possesses a central supermassive black hole and enormous clouds of gas and dust extending far above and below its plane. \nKnown as Fermi bubbles , these structures were likely created by the black hole feeding at some point in the past. When the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy crashes into us in about 4 billion years, \u201cmaybe we\u2019ll get lit up as an AGN again\u201d, says Comerford. \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "comerford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam mann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie comerford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "travis fischer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goddard space flight center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "boulder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenbelt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T21:14:54.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "463da79262dfe879dfdf6e6eb565c06646a6ae0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLasK2G5d8rA_2pL6gefEg1VKC8pl6Z6Rq0MIN_BqgWHQQJbnFTZLONNXQkmQqKh.zLH41YIgixcp0ZfEKqdwU3HaJRpMcHbUykg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Smartphone lets you see round corners by light flicker on floor", "title_full": "Smartphone lets you see round corners by light flicker on floor", "published": "2017-10-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09144256/gettyimages-172256190.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 152, "comments": 0, "shares": 152}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "463da79262dfe879dfdf6e6eb565c06646a6ae0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLasK2G5d8rA_2pL6gefEg1VKC8pl6Z6Rq0MIN_BqgWHQQJbnFTZLONNXQkmQqKh.zLH41YIgixcp0ZfEKqdwU3HaJRpMcHbUykg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Smartphone lets you see round corners by light flicker on floor", "text": "Smartphone lets you see round corners by light flicker on floor I can see you\u2026 even if you can\u2019t see me AndreasReh/Getty By Douglas Heaven \nThe walls may not have eyes \u2013 but you can turn them into cameras that let you see around corners. Armed with a smartphone and some straightforward optical analysis, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has shown that you can spot moving objects hidden from view around corners. By watching changes in the reflected light pooling on the floor at the base of a wall, they were able to trace the paths of people not visible through the open door. The technique could be used by vehicles to spot pedestrians in blind spots or let response teams see around corners in hostage situations . \n\u201cA lot of our work involves finding hidden signals you wouldn\u2019t think would be there,\u201d says team member Katie Bouman. For example, in a previous project Bouman and her colleagues turned a window into a kind of aperture on the outside world. By taking consecutive frames of the shifting light spilling through it, they were able to construct pictures of what was happening out of sight. But, counterintuitively, corners are even better than windows. \u201cThey\u2019re everywhere and allow us to see hidden things all the time,\u201d she says. \nThe trick is tracking tiny variations in the colour of light. A similar technique can let phone and web cameras detect someone\u2019s pulse by detecting fluctuations in skin tone. Bouman and her colleagues realised that variations in colour in a pool of light by a floor corner contained information about hidden objects reflecting that light. By analysing the patterns, they mapped the trajectory of the objects moving behind the wall. Advertisement Hiding in plain sight \nThey tested the system with people walking around a room with the door ajar. Using a single corner of the floor, they generated a video that showed how many people were hidden from view, and where they were walking. With two corners \u2013 such as in a doorway \u2013 the could also see where the people were in the room. The technique works with a variety of light sources \u2013 both indoors and out \u2013 and in different weather conditions, including rain. It also works on a range of surfaces, such as linoleum, carpet, tile and brick paving with weeds. The only thing that thwarts it is darkness. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty simple idea, really fast for processing,\u201d says Bouman. Since the video can be computed quickly, it could be used in cars or industrial vehicles to spot people just out of sight in a room. And because the system relies on ambient light your presence can be undetectable. The project is one of many funded by US defence technology agency DARPA , who are looking into similar techniques, says Bouman. \u201cLots of people are working on different methods to see around corners.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool work,\u201d says Fadel Adib at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, who has worked on a similar system using Wi-Fi. He is impressed that Bouban\u2019s team can analyse the light in real time using just a consumer camera. He also thinks that by refining the analysis it would be possible to extract even more information \u2013 perhaps helping to distinguish individuals wearing similar coloured clothes, for example. \u201cThis is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he says. \nIndeed, Bouman is now applying her tricks to imaging black holes . It\u2019s much the same thing, she says. \u201cTake the noise and extract something meaningful.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bouman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katie bouman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bouban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fadel adib", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "massachusetts institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darpa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "media lab", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T21:14:54.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "566d97df393b0cdd477850dde705ceeade3a671c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_yUDNQThcAvVjFOtBPxQ.6h0IULt38YbBYwixv7MVz1naMVe6idJ3p2QOoTSgyC7JTWjog6F85.Gt8YPZpmgfGBINbs5gvHTIf6Tm839SOl", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/health", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "The real roots of early city states may rip up the textbooks", "title_full": "The real roots of early city states may rip up the textbooks", "published": "2017-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04180000/nationalgeographic_1424819.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1201, "comments": 0, "shares": 1201}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "566d97df393b0cdd477850dde705ceeade3a671c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_yUDNQThcAvVjFOtBPxQ.6h0IULt38YbBYwixv7MVz1naMVe6idJ3p2QOoTSgyC7JTWjog6F85.Gt8YPZpmgfGBINbs5gvHTIf6Tm839SOl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The real roots of early city states may rip up the textbooks", "text": "The real roots of early city states may rip up the textbooks The 11,000-year-old G\u00f6bekli Tepe was an amazingly complex find Vincent J Musi/National Geographic Creative By Ben Collyer \nTHE emergence of state authority was a logical consequence of the move to settled agriculture, or so we thought. Until recently, we also assumed that ancient peoples welcomed the advantages of this way of life as well as the growth of state leadership, since it was key to the development of culture, crafts and civil order. \nOver the past 50 years, though, more and more cracks have appeared in this picture. We now know settled agriculture existed for several thousand years before the emergence of the city states of the Near East and Asia. In the past few years, archaeologists have been stunned to find 11,000-year-old structures such as those at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, in what is now southern Turkey. These were built by peoples who foraged, and who also developed specialised skills, both artistic and artisanal. \nThis is a surprise, and leaves researchers busily trying to get the story straight \u2013 something that really matters for a number of reasons. Traditional definitions of the state and its authority hinged on the right to raise taxes, and on its legal monopoly on coercing its people, from punishing and imprisoning them to waging formal war. \nBut as James Scott points out, roughly between 8000 BC and 4000 BC we find settled agricultural communities with developing craft skills \u2013 yet no evidence of anything much by way of state authority. \nThis also poses a key question, one which resonates in the 21st century, about whether there is a necessary link between state power and community life. \nScott is a political science researcher at Yale University who has stepped out of his academic comfort zone to grapple with the new archaeological reality. Against the Grain delivers not only a darker story, but also a broad understanding of the forces that shaped the formation of states and why they collapsed \u2013 right up to the industrial age. \nInterestingly, his conclusions find grim contemporary echoes in a new book about the San Bushmen of the Kalahari by anthropologist James Suzman, who spent 25 years with them. In Affluence without Abundance , Suzman, an African studies fellow at the University of Cambridge, documents what happened when pastoralists, encouraged by governments, enclosed the San\u2019s lands and took away their hunter-gatherer way of life. \nThe San\u2019s recent past is like a speeded-up version of Scott\u2019s tale. He teases out the elements of how states formed, especially in Mesopotamia \u2013 specifically what is now modern southern Iraq. It was here that the first small city states appeared, on the northern shore of the Gulf and on plains created and watered by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. San Bushmen are trying to cling on to their traditional way of life Jason Edwards/National Geographic Creative \nThere is some evidence for settlements among foragers in the Near East, often near wetlands, around 12,000 BC, and field agriculture from about 10,000 BC. But the earliest evidence of states dates from 4000 BC, with permanently settled towns. This is where Scott derives that figure of at least 4000 years between settlement-plus-agriculture (the two assumed prerequisites of state formation) and the first appearance of the state. \nAround 12,000 BC, the world\u2019s population stood at between two and four million; by 2000 BC, it was around 25 million. But the vast majority of people had no contact with states as late as the end of the 15th century \u2013 Europe\u2019s middle ages. These people survived on a mix of agriculture and foraging, much like the inhabitants of those early settlements on the plains of Mesopotamia before 4000 BC. \nScott describes the creation, from around 4000 BC, of what he calls \u201clate-Neolithic multispecies resettlement camps\u201d. Faced with a shortage of wild resources, these made use of domesticated animals and plants. Life in these settlements was much tougher than foraging, and the daily drudgery, chronic illness and epidemics brought on by increased reliance on domesticated species are apparent in skeletal remains and sudden collapses in population. \nAs the Danish agricultural economist Ester Boserup and some anthropologists have noted, there is little reason to imagine foragers would have adopted this way of life unless they were hungry, afraid or coerced. \nA combination of factors seems to have caused people to cluster in those Mesopotamian plains, including rising populations in areas where wild food was more abundant, a cold spell in the climate, and possibly a rise in sea level. The populations in Scott\u2019s camps developed even better craft skills and social cohesion. \nEarly state development around the world has another defining feature, a staple diet of cereals. By contrast, agricultures based on tubers or pulses have no fixed harvest period and create no stockpiles. As Scott remarks, there are no early states founded on manioc, yam or sweet potato. \nBut the annual grain harvest creates two problems: storage, which requires protection; and vulnerability to thieving supervisors or outside raiders. It also ties producers to their store in time and space \u2013 no wandering off with a bow and arrow. \nIt seems likely, says Scott, that at first there was a voluntary approach to collective labour in fields, and to grain being pooled for safekeeping and even redistribution to the needy. But this created all the technical and organisational know-how for an increasingly coercive state. Constrained to a relatively small area, people were dependent on central grain stores, and grew used to supervision of both food distribution and their labour \u2013 things that feature almost obsessively in early writing. \nBy 3000 BC, we have the first definitive evidence of city states, with kings, bureaucracies, compulsory labour, taxation and punishment for non-compliance. These early states were also very fragile, prone to epidemics, soil degradation and political collapse. \nPredictably, then, those early city states in Mesopotamia soon entered a long period of rivalry and shifting alliances. A key element was the struggle to dominate trade with hinterland peoples who had access to stone, timber and other resources not found on the alluvial plains. \nThis became a common theme among the emerging cereal states and was mirrored much later elsewhere, for example, in China\u2019s \u201cwarring states\u201d period, starting in the 5th century BC. Victors subjected conquered neighbours to tribute, bondage and forced resettlement, particularly to do unskilled work in erecting city walls and irrigation. Thousands of identical, crude, bevelled pottery bowls found around Mesopotamia suggest measured rations for gang labour. \u201cFor at least 4000 years, there were settled communities but no evidence of state power\u201d \nSlavery and severe punishment for escapees remained at the heart of subsequent regional kingdoms and empires. Each civilisation retained trade links with those in surrounding areas, the so-called barbarians. These were typically pastoralists who often kept some foraging component to their diets, and tended to be healthier and to have more personal freedoms. \nThis set up a dynamic that repeated into the last millennium, with people in the non-state periphery trading goods and slaves, and periodically raiding cereal-based cities. Tied together in this tense relationship, roaming pastoralists and urban states (Scott\u2019s \u201cdark twins\u201d of history) slowly captured or wiped out foragers and their way of life. \nThe same dark twins are in evidence in Suzman\u2019s affectionate and thoughtful book. Many of the San were compelled to work on cattle ranches in miserable and often violent conditions, while their foraging territories were fenced off by surrounding pastoralists or ranchers. Some still remember the \u201cold times\u201d, but knowledge of the wild food sources they once relied on is dwindling. Groups are resettled in remote camps with a few shops, useless to them without money. \nUnder these new conditions, the forager mindset, its distaste for authority, expectation of natural providence, and code of sharing and honour, is often utterly broken. Some turn to drink or give in to the inevitable by taking up low-paid menial work. \nIn this fashion, through neglect, abuse and misunderstanding, an ancient way of life is being finally extinguished by the imperatives of local agriculture and its state support, reducing biodiversity to dusty waste. Yet, Suzman argues, even now the Bushmen have much to teach us about a social order that, in many ways, offered a freer, fairer existence and a non-invasive adaptation to ecology. \nSuzman and Scott have both written excellent books, which could serve on reading lists for geography, history and politics, as well as in their natural homes of archaeology and anthropology.

box can survive outside the body Donated hearts will travel better Bettmann/Getty By Clare Wilson \nA new way of keeping hearts alive but \u201casleep\u201d in a box outside the body for a day or more could bring an end to people dying on the heart transplant waiting list. \nThe system was tested on the first patient in August, albeit with the heart kept in this state for just 3 hours, New Scientist can reveal. It will be tested on another five people for this same time and, if all goes well, the time will be gradually raised to 24 hours. Stig Steen at Lund University in Sweden, who developed the technique, says it could potentially be used for up to several days. \nAny ability to keep hearts alive for longer outside the body boosts the number available for transplants. There is a shortage of all organs for transplant, with over a thousand people in the UK dying every year for want of one. \nIn England, the shortfall may be eased by the forthcoming switch to an \u201copt-out\u201d system of organ donation, announced last week. But it won\u2019t disappear, partly because only a fraction of people who die in hospital have organs suitable for donation, and families will still be able to override their relatives\u2019 wishes. \nWith hearts, a particular problem is distance between the donor and the patient, because hearts can only be kept alive outside the body for a few hours before weakening. \u201cNow we say no to a lot of good hearts,\u201d says Steen. \u201cWith the new way, we can take hearts from theoretically the whole world.

But Abdessattar Abdelkefi and his team at New Mexico State University did just that while trying to devise better drones. \nMany large soaring birds like the albatross have wings that are white underneath and black on top. Previous explanations focused on camouflage, says Graham Martin at the University of Birmingham, UK. Advertisement \nBut does that colouring really boost endurance in flight? Most soaring needs no flapping of wings; instead, the bird exploits air currents to glide. \nAbdelkefi\u2019s team discovered that a wing\u2019s black upper surface absorbs sunlight very efficiently, causing it to be around 10\u00b0C warmer than the lower surface. That effectively lowers air pressure on the upper surface, lowering drag and generating extra lift ( Journal of Thermal Biology , doi.org/f96ggw ). \nSvana Rogalla at the University of Ghent, Belgium, says thermography has proved that the dark upper wing gets hotter in sunlight , but it is too early to pin down its effect on drag. The impact of colour on flight could be a further inducement for birds to make costly melanin pigment to darken feathers, she says. \nThe team hopes the findings will help them design more efficient and durable drones for use at sea. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cAlbatross teaches drones new tricks\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frans lanting/national geographic cre", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "svana rogalla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdessattar abdelkefi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdelkefi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graham martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of ghent", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T15:27:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5af8ab906841f2da87e12c25175515f8c9a4b06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLau1Fe8sJGfbth5Zvobs0UtVUlu3Vh3SqIMi3o.Hwh12WEd08wgXJHZ.gbBDaipZ2DRrtz2mdVSHfHOFkdM2gqtg-", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/mental-health", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Will Alphabet\u2019s internet balloons really help Puerto Rico?", "title_full": "Will Alphabet\u2019s internet balloons really help Puerto Rico?", "published": "2017-10-10T15:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10124300/rtsf2cb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 99, "comments": 0, "shares": 99}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d5af8ab906841f2da87e12c25175515f8c9a4b06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLau1Fe8sJGfbth5Zvobs0UtVUlu3Vh3SqIMi3o.Hwh12WEd08wgXJHZ.gbBDaipZ2DRrtz2mdVSHfHOFkdM2gqtg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T15:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will Alphabet\u2019s internet balloons really help Puerto Rico?", "text": "Will Alphabet\u2019s internet balloons really help Puerto Rico?

New York Times/Redux/Eyevine By Matt Reynolds \nPREDICTIVE policing that aims to work out when and where a crime will take place promises a future of data-driven law enforcement. But a flaw found in the design of the software used suggests that instead of fixing biases in policing, predictive algorithms are to blame for a whole new set of problems. \nPre-crime tech is catching on in the US. PredPol \u2013 a market-leading system \u2013 is already used by police departments in places such as California, Florida and Maryland. Their hope is that such systems will bring down crime rates while simultaneously reducing human bias in policing. \nBut when researchers in the US examined how PredPol predicts crime, they found something disturbing. Their study suggests that the software merely sparks a \u201cfeedback loop\u201d that leads to officers being repeatedly sent to certain neighbourhoods \u2013 typically ones with a high number of racial minorities \u2013 regardless of the true crime rate in that area ( arxiv.org/abs/1706.09847 ). Advertisement \nThe problem stems from the logic that PredPol uses to decide where officers should be sent. If an officer is sent to a neighbourhood and then makes an arrest, the software takes this as indicating a good chance of more crimes in that area in future. \nWhat this means, says Matt Kusner at the Alan Turing Institute in London, is that the PredPol system seems to be learning from arrest rates \u2013 which are higher in areas where there are more police \u2013 rather than from underlying crime rates. \n\u201cThat\u2019s how dangerous feedback loops are,\u201d says Joshua Loftus at New York University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Although these loops are only part of how PredPol makes its predictions, he says they may explain why predictive policing algorithms have sometimes seemed to recreate exactly the kind of racial biases their creators say they overcome. \u201cA \u2018feedback loop\u2019 in software leads to officers being repeatedly sent to certain neighbourhoods\u201d \nTo better understand how the system comes to its conclusions, the study team created a simplified mathematical model of the PredPol software. The algorithm chooses how to distribute a certain number of officers between two locations. If more are sent to one location, they tend to make more arrests there. The team found that this feeds back into the system and leads it to send even more officers to that same place. \nThat means the software ends up overestimating the crime rate in one neighbourhood, without taking into account the possibility that more crime is observed there simply because more officers have been sent there \u2013 like a computerised version of confirmation bias. \nThere might be a way to stop the feedback loop. The authors also modelled a different system, in which the algorithm only sent more officers to a neighbourhood if the area\u2019s crime rate was higher than expected. This led it to distribute officers in a way that much more closely matched the true crime rate. \nLoftus says that many more problems need to be solved before policing algorithms can be truly called fair. \u201cHuman decisions affect every aspect of the design of the system,\u201d he says. The algorithm could be thrown off if officers are more likely to arrest racial minorities, for example. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cA flaw in the pre-crime system\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loftus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joshua loftus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt kusner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan turing institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T16:09:20.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea885503c18198708609faa06c1ac7800988cd2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX5UJKWOD5x8yKnGqzJDErACdnk64MAZrEVD_F9M30VRSqRBo2EDISqoWtA.8YSvudrYRy3yssc5rz..7IY5xbIjjiTiTPkbm.Q--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/energy-fuels", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "The dearth of women in tech is nothing to do with testosterone", "title_full": "The dearth of women in tech is nothing to do with testosterone", "published": "2017-10-10T16:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10133516/gettyimages-107070353.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 499, "comments": 0, "shares": 499}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea885503c18198708609faa06c1ac7800988cd2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX5UJKWOD5x8yKnGqzJDErACdnk64MAZrEVD_F9M30VRSqRBo2EDISqoWtA.8YSvudrYRy3yssc5rz..7IY5xbIjjiTiTPkbm.Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T16:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "The dearth of women in tech is nothing to do with testosterone", "text": "10 October 2017 The dearth of women in tech is nothing to do with testosterone Arguments over the causes of the gender gap in STEM jobs rage on.

Someone next to me used the word \u201cCommonwealth\u201d without irony. Would there have been such a spirit without Brexit? Probably not: this is a show about the genius of another country that very much wants to project Britain\u2019s own global aspirations. Any historian of Anglo-British relations will give a sardonic smile at this. \nWhen you visit (and you should), try to look around the smaller, artefacts-driven gallery first. Advertisement \nThis room tells the stories of Indian science \u2013 stories plural because there can never be one, linear account of how such dissimilar and contesting cultures struggled and more or less succeeded in understanding and exploiting a space of such extraordinary complexity. \nNaturally, since India has a past to boast of, pride of place goes to its indigenous cultures. It was the Indus valley civilisation, after all, whose peoples fashioned standardised weights around 4000 years ago: items that indicate high levels of arithmetical literacy, communication and trade. Ancient surgery \nAnd there are reconstructions of Ayurvedic surgical instruments described in records dating back to around 500 BC. Also on show is a 1800-year-old document containing the first example of the use of zero. Wonderfully, radiocarbon dating pushed the document\u2019s age back by 500 years just before the exhibition opened. \nIt is a measure of the wisdom of the curators that such an illustrious past isn\u2019t allowed to overshadow India\u2019s more recent achievements. For example, Jagadish Chandra Bose\u2019s early-20th-century crescograph, designed to observe plant growth at a magnification of 10,000 times, reminds us why he is often called the father of modern Indian science. Replica Ayurvedic tool Science Museum Group \nAnother winning object is Chandrasekhara Raman\u2019s spectrometer. Raman was the first Indian to win a Nobel prize, for physics, in 1930. \nAnd what of that other great empire far to the north? Well, there is a map of George Everest\u2019s career-defining Great Trigonometrical Survey of India \u2013 the teamwork of 70 years distilled on a single, meticulously drawn map. And nearby are details of a recent collaboration between Surrey Satellite Technology in the UK and the Indian Space Research Organisation on the Earth-surveying NovaSAR satellite. \nSome of the deeper, darker questions about Anglo-Indian relations are posed in the second, photographic half of the exhibition. Split nature \nThere, the anthropometric photographs of Maurice Portman make a depressingly silly impression next to the respectful, revealing and entirely unlicentious photographs Ram Singh took of the women of his own harem: powerful political players all, who shaped the country through marriage and allied treaties. \nIt is hard to say why the split nature of Illuminating India works as well as it does. It has something to do with the way the rooms handle political power. \nIndia\u2019s science, from its ancient stepwells that gathered monsoon waters to the bureaucratic and algorithmic marvel that is today\u2019s tiffin tin-based lunch delivery system, has been driven by the complex needs of a massive population making a living. \nSimilarly, its doing-more-with-less style of innovation is reflected in everything from the world\u2019s cheapest artificial leg (the Jaipur leg , made of rubber, plastic and wood) to the world\u2019s cheapest Mars-orbiting camera. \nVisitors to Illuminating India will leave thinking that technology may, after all, be making the world a better place, and that what people do is ultimately more influential than who they are. \nIlluminating India: 5000 years of science and innovation and Illuminating India: Photography 1857 \u2013 2017 are at the Science Museum, London, until 31 March 2018 \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chandrasekhara raman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george everest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ram singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chila burman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurice portman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jagadish chandra bose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon ings  one", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "science museum group  another", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "science museum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian space research organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey satellite technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "science museum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaipur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T18:35:21.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f16b3f312e4b5d0f397c20668622b0b946486c93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX8vR7xAAreDAE5ScA4nJq7ju9d7i.GfYDXILTun8xzYhswZx5_JV.PGlX0qqnIy8.PANu.j78dmZjmuhBPhbAYUZJjCG8n44jw--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/books-art", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "It was always mad to shoot for Mars before colonising the moon", "title_full": "It was always mad to shoot for Mars before colonising the moon", "published": "2017-10-10T18:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10152621/comment-moon.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f16b3f312e4b5d0f397c20668622b0b946486c93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX8vR7xAAreDAE5ScA4nJq7ju9d7i.GfYDXILTun8xzYhswZx5_JV.PGlX0qqnIy8.PANu.j78dmZjmuhBPhbAYUZJjCG8n44jw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T18:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "It was always mad to shoot for Mars before colonising the moon", "text": "It was always mad to shoot for Mars before colonising the moon More moon bases needed ESA \nThe good news is that this apparently kicks the fashionable but faintly absurd idea of attempting to colonise Mars ahead of the moon into the long grass.

Female bottlenose dolphins can control the paternity of their offspring Flip Nicklin/Minden Pictures/FLPA By Josh Gabbatiss \nSome female dolphins have evolved a secret weapon in their sexual arms race with males: vaginas that protect them from fertilisation by unwelcome partners. \nPenises come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, especially in dolphins and other cetaceans. That seems to imply a similar diversity in vaginas, but Dara Orbach of Dalhousie University, Canada, says there is \u201ca huge lag\u201d in our understanding of female genitalia. \nThat is partly because it is tricky to visualise vaginal structure. To overcome this problem, Orbach has created silicone moulds of cetaceans\u2019 vaginas, revealing complex folds and spirals. Advertisement \n\u201cThere\u2019s this unparalleled level of vaginal diversity that we had no idea existed before,\u201d Orbach says. \nSimilarly complex vaginal structures are found in several species of duck. Orbach\u2019s collaborator Patricia Brennan of Mount Holyoke College, Massachusetts, has previously found evidence that duck vaginas have evolved to make it harder for males to force copulation . So Orbach wondered if female cetaceans\u2019 unusual vaginas had also evolved to keep out unwanted sperm. \nOrbach, Brennan and their colleagues obtained genitals from marine mammals that had died of natural causes: common and bottlenose dolphins, common porpoises and common seals . They inflated the males\u2019 penises with saline to see how they looked when they were erect, and compared them with the vaginal moulds. They also took CT scans of penises inserted into the corresponding vaginas, to determine whether they fitted in easily and the best positions. Take back control \nThe vaginas of the common dolphin and common seal seemed amenable to penetration, suggesting their genitalia had evolved to allow males access. But the common porpoise and bottlenose dolphin had extensive vaginal folds that obstructed penis entry. \nMale bottlenose dolphins form alliances two to four strong to keep competitors away from females. When confronted by such an alliance, a female has little choice in who mates with her, and may mate with everyone. \nHowever, vaginal folds could grant her some agency, says Janet Mann of Georgetown University in Washington DC. \u201cShe may not choose who she mates with, but might be able to choose which male or, more precisely, which sperm, fertilises her egg.\u201d \nIn all four species studied, the ideal position for successful fertilisation appeared to be the male on top with his penis hooked underneath the female. Any deviation from this tended to result in unsuccessful penetration. That is consistent with Orbach and Mann\u2019s observations of wild porpoises and dolphins mating. \nThis combination of precise positioning and complex vaginal structures means that subtle mid-copulation movements by females could send the penis the wrong way in their vaginas, preventing fertilisation. \n\u201cIt might appear behaviourally that females are very passive,\u201d says Orbach. \u201cBut looking at the reproductive anatomy, we\u2019re learning that they have all sorts of cryptic ways to control paternity.\u201d \nJournal reference: Proceedings of the Royal Society B , DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2017.1265 \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh gabbatiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dara orbach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orbach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brennan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet mann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patricia brennan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dalhousie university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount holyoke college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T03:33:55.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1af8230a2d49f27568b3f2249f828d56449e6ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowfhq5t83Dr.WcY_iuSQsbMd5Pfoldd9eDSVxoAuF8Eck87Uq5JIU.x28LHCYzEcVVc3_xyUG39K", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "", "title": "We urgently need to broaden the conversation on AI", "title_full": "We urgently need to broaden the conversation on AI", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04180000/gettyimages-505451906.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1af8230a2d49f27568b3f2249f828d56449e6ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowfhq5t83Dr.WcY_iuSQsbMd5Pfoldd9eDSVxoAuF8Eck87Uq5JIU.x28LHCYzEcVVc3_xyUG39K", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "We urgently need to broaden the conversation on AI", "text": "5 We urgently need to broaden the conversation on AI \nIt\u2019s time to get past the scare stories and start discussing the real uses and abuses of machine learning ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T05:20:04.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a983129eb6e3266f138c9181cc391a15cf934654", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_HxUAMrUmNSlqeg4Efv4ZUbnTo.PcQi9WwfaFumQdIUGCr0whk4FCh5DX8rtUlNDyKXSRJkQL8RBD4yxqqgPSpeUWNkd3EV7g--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist -

Are you getting enough shut-eye, asks sleep scientist Matthew Walker Julia Yellow By Matthew Walker \nI DON\u2019T mean to pry, but how much sleep did you get last night? What about over the past week? I ask because the answer could have serious consequences for your future mental health. \nMore than 44 million people worldwide currently have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, including members of my own family. The health, economic and personal impact is staggering. There has been a marked acceleration in the number being diagnosed with the disease as the human lifespan has increased, but importantly, as total sleep time has decreased . Read more: Top tips to get a better night\u2019s sleep and improve your health \nAs a sleep scientist, I became interested in this connection some years ago. What I have found is striking. Not only does sleep disruption play a role in the declining mental abilities that typify Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but getting enough sleep is one of the most important factors determining whether you will develop the condition in the future. \nThe implications are huge. We are quickly filling in missing pieces of the Alzheimer\u2019s puzzle, and now we also recognise that sleep offers a route for diagnosis, therapy and even prevention. \nAs we age, our sleep gets worse . This is especially true for the quality of our deep, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (see chart ). Unfortunately, this is the very type of sleep that we now know helps fix new memories into the architecture of the brain , preventing you from forgetting. \nBut if you assess a patient with Alzheimer\u2019s disease , the disruption of deep sleep is exaggerated.

Michael Arrington, founder of tech news site TechCrunch, used real estate start-up Propy to help him snap up the home without setting foot in the country. The transaction took place entirely via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain using cryptocurrency. \nBlockchains are cryptographically secure ledgers that store every transaction made in a system across many different computers, protecting them from fraud. Originally designed to support digital currencies, they promise to revolutionise far more than monetary transactions. The tech has already allowed people to trade things like excess energy from their solar panels , and to participate in a form of direct voting called liquid democracy . Little wonder \u201cdisrupting\u201d real estate has been a long-standing promise of blockchains. \nMoving international property transactions onto a blockchain should speed up the process of conveyancing and exchanging of paper contracts. It also should make transactions more transparent and properties easier to sell to overseas buyers. Advertisement \nSan Francisco-based Propy is not the first to try to use the blockchain. Global real estate outfit REX is creating a global property listing service to connect sellers, buyers and agents across multiple countries. ATLANT, based in New York, is experimenting with a form of blockchain-supported property ownership where many people can co-own a property in much the same way shareholders jointly own a company. \nBut Propy is the first to understand that transactions need government involvement. \u201cPeople can do property swaps all they want but without a government to enforce them, it\u2019s meaningless,\u201d says Paul Madore, who writes reports on blockchain start-ups for investors. \nReal estate transactions need to be recorded in an official ledger that is legally binding and recognised by all parties. In the UK, this is the government-controlled Land Registry. Propy envisions that different jurisdictions will adopt the Propy registry as their official ledger. This would mean that simply transferring property via Propy would count as a legal transfer of ownership. \u201cMaking a traditionally bureaucratic process simpler and more transparent is a short-term win,\u201d says Nina Jankowicz, a Fulbright-Clinton public policy fellow in Ukraine. \nPropy is working with Ukraine\u2019s e-government agency and ministry of justice. CEO Natalia Karayaneva says the company is also in talks with officials in Vermont, California and Dubai. \u201cThey are figuring out which laws they need to change,\u201d she says. \nBlockchain technology will inevitably power property transactions in the near future, says Madore. But companies like Propy may not be running the show. \u201cPropy expects the governments of the world to bend to its will,\u201d he says. Governments are slow to change, but most will want to develop their own blockchain platforms, he says. \nIf you read Propy\u2019s small print, the company knows this too, says Madore. If something goes wrong, it can\u2019t help you, he says. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cNeed a home?

They gave these cells a cocktail of chemicals to prevent them from maturing, trapping them in a very young, primordial state. \nThe team has named them \u201cexpanded-potential stem cells\u201d (EPSCs), because \u2013 unlike any other stem cells in the lab \u2013 they are able to create placenta and yolk sac tissue.

This means that researchers should be able to turn embryonic stem cells (which are taken from older embryos) and induced pluripotent stem cells (which are created from mature cells from skin or elsewhere) into EPSCs. \u201cWe can erase all memories in these cells and take them back to the equivalent of a blank piece of paper,\u201d says Liu. \n\u201cThis is very exciting research that lays the foundation for generating EPSCs from human embryos,\u201d says Jan Brosens of the University of Warwick. \u201cSuch a resource would enable us to study how the developing embryo could be protected from an adverse womb environment and potentially lead to new treatments to prevent recurrent miscarriage.\u201d Journal reference: Nature , DOI: 10.1038/nature24052", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pentao liu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy coghlan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jan brosens", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sanger institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of warwick", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T21:15:52.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64ac9dfda62fcf812737a853987ec871cee1eb66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX9vf8evXVPDNYTpWNGj3oCQLpnq3YtaoIhFmNso2Fc5nhc1d9HVgFxho0WvOdlLi7nvd9C9_kPo945Hm_JXpj0P9Np7STl.9Hg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Distant dwarf planet near Pluto has a ring that no one expected", "title_full": "Distant dwarf planet near Pluto has a ring that no one expected", "published": "2017-10-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/11170731/haumea.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 927, "comments": 0, "shares": 927}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 34}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64ac9dfda62fcf812737a853987ec871cee1eb66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX9vf8evXVPDNYTpWNGj3oCQLpnq3YtaoIhFmNso2Fc5nhc1d9HVgFxho0WvOdlLi7nvd9C9_kPo945Hm_JXpj0P9Np7STl.9Hg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Distant dwarf planet near Pluto has a ring that no one expected", "text": "Distant dwarf planet near Pluto has a ring that no one expected Haumea: egg-shaped and ringed IAA-CSIC/UHU By Ken Croswell \nA ring has been found around Haumea, a world more than 2 billion kilometres beyond Pluto. The ring is the most distant ever seen in our solar system. \n\u201cThis is a landmark discovery,\u201d says Alan Stern at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting.\u201d \nUntil recently, the only known rings circled giant planets such as Saturn. In 2013, however, astronomers found two rings around Chariklo , an odd little rock about 250 kilometres across between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. Chiron, one of Chariklo\u2019s neighbours, may also have a ring. Advertisement \nNow astronomers have found a ring beyond Neptune. Jos\u00e9-Luis Ortiz and Pablo Santos-Sanz at the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Granada, Spain, and their colleagues watched the dwarf planet Haumea pass in front of a dim red star in the constellation Bo\u00f6tes on 21 January this year. A total of 12 telescopes in six European countries tracked the eclipse. \nThe duration of the eclipse revealed Haumea\u2019s size and shape. But before and after it moved completely in front of the star, a ring around Haumea\u2019s equator blocked some of the starlight. \u201cIt was really an amazing surprise,\u201d says Santos-Sanz. The ring is 70 kilometres wide and about 2290 kilometres from Haumea\u2019s centre. Spinning like a top \n\u201cThis is fabulous. It\u2019s a really great discovery,\u201d says William McKinnon at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. \nHe says that Haumea\u2019s many odd properties may provide clues on how it came to have a ring in the first place. The far-off world is shaped like an egg, which may result from its whirlwind rotation. Haumea completes a full spin every 3 hours and 55 minutes, whereas the dwarf planet Pluto, which is almost perfectly round, rotates every 6.4 Earth days. Every 24 hours, a resident on Haumea\u2019s equator would see six sunrises and six sunsets. It also has two small moons. \nMcKinnon suspects that all these traits are linked. He thinks a large object may have hit Haumea, causing it to spin and eject debris that created both the ring and the moons. \nThis impact would also explain another phenomenon: several other bodies travel on almost the same path around the sun as Haumea and share its composition, having water ice on their surfaces. They could all have been born during the same initial smash-up. Shiny new worlds \nOrtiz and Santos-Sanz also found that Haumea is slightly larger than once thought: at its widest, it is nearly the diameter of Pluto, the largest-known object orbiting the sun beyond Neptune. It is, however, only about 1025 kilometres across at its narrowest point, less than half Pluto\u2019s diameter. \nIt is also much less dense than previously thought and has a make-up similar to Pluto\u2019s. Both worlds are mostly rock, surrounded by water ice. And both are shiny, reflecting about half the light that strikes them. \nStern says all these interesting properties could make Haumea a good candidate for an exploratory visit from a spacecraft such as NASA\u2019s New Horizons probe , which sped past Pluto in 2015. \nIn fact, New Horizons has just begun its own search for rings around dozens of distant worlds. \u201cWhat we want to know is, are these rings rare or routine?\u201d says Stern, who is principal investigator for New Horizons. \nThe spacecraft is heading in the wrong direction to study Haumea, but Stern says we could launch a probe its way. \u201cGiven the object\u2019s egg shape, two satellites and ring, it would be a really amazing place to go visit,\u201d he says. \nJournal reference: Nature , DOI: 10.1038/nature24051 Article amended on 11 October 2017 \nWe have corrected Haumea\u2019s dimensions \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "haumea", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ken croswell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santos-sanz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pablo santos-sanz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mckinnon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william mckinnon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jos\u00e9-luis ortiz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ortiz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan stern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chariklo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "chiron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new horizons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute of astrophysics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pluto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neptune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boulder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haumea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andalusia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "granada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chariklo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st louis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T21:15:54.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ccdaf31520cca7a94bc43338b87162174bcb99dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXoyulmdUVOSCWEx7EiIXZdXJD_LrG97TL0RhAtIF_zpXI49nMqbfl75wKCG26T5Ca7jUsV6UyU_0Sf1ew.DeR.WUfMve3GyO72g--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/exploring-mars", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Google\u2019s new earbuds act as two-way translators in your ear", "title_full": "Google\u2019s new earbuds act as two-way translators in your ear", "published": "2017-10-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/11180000/gettyimages-857590720.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1378, "comments": 0, "shares": 1378}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 1}}}, "uuid": "ccdaf31520cca7a94bc43338b87162174bcb99dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXoyulmdUVOSCWEx7EiIXZdXJD_LrG97TL0RhAtIF_zpXI49nMqbfl75wKCG26T5Ca7jUsV6UyU_0Sf1ew.DeR.WUfMve3GyO72g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google\u2019s new earbuds act as two-way translators in your ear", "text": "Google\u2019s new earbuds act as two-way translators in your ear Let me talk marketing-speak Elijah Nouvelle/AFP/Getty \nIF YOU have a Google Pixel phone, you will soon be able to speak 40 languages.

Luca Trovato/The Image Bank/Getty By Jessica Hamzelou \nFor the first time, researchers have shown that being born by C-section can contribute to obesity in mice. This probably happens because the procedure disrupts a newborn\u2019s microbiome. \nUntil fairly recently, babies were thought to be born with sterile guts free from bacteria. But we now know that babies are born with a gutful of microbes , and that at least some of these come from a mother\u2019s vaginal canal during birth. \nBabies born by C-section are thought to miss out on these bacteria, which could explain why their microbiomes look different . The ecosystem of microbes that live inside us has been implicated in a range of health issues, so this may explain why babies born by C-section are more likely to grow up overweight, and to develop allergies and asthma in later life. \nTo test if C-sections really do lead to heavier babies, Maria Dominguez-Bello at New York University and her colleagues performed C-sections on 34 pregnant mice, and compared the resulting pups to 35 that were born vaginally. By the time the mice had grown into adults 15 weeks later, there were stark difference in body weight between the two groups. The mice born by C-section were, on average, 33 per cent heavier than those born vaginally. Heavier females \nFemales seemed particularly affected, says Dominguez-Bello. While the C-section males were around 20 per cent heavier than their vaginally-born counterparts, the females were 70 per cent heavier, she says. \u201cWe were very surprised to see this,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have no idea why it\u2019s happening.\u201d \nThe microbiomes of the C-section mice also looked different to those born vaginally. By the time they were four weeks old, the C-section mice had lower levels of some bacterial species and more of others. The team don\u2019t know whether these changes might impact the mice\u2019s health. \nWhile the C-section mice are heavier, it isn\u2019t clear whether they are actually unhealthy. They don\u2019t have a higher proportion of body fat \u2013 rather, it seems that their bones, fat and tissues just grow much more than vaginally-born mice. Vaginal swabbing \nThe team think that being deprived of the bacteria in the vaginal canal could somehow prime pups \u2013 and possibly human babies \u2013 for obesity later in life. \nPhillip Bennett of Imperial College London isn\u2019t convinced the findings apply to humans. Mice have a diverse range of vaginal bacteria, while in people, the vaginal microbiome is largely dominated by a single strain . \nAt any rate, C-section births don\u2019t hugely increase the risk of obesity in human children, says Bennett. \u201cYou\u2019re 1.3 times more likely to be obese if you\u2019re delivered by Caesarean section than vaginally,\u201d he says. But this statistic might be warped by the fact that obese mothers are more likely to require the surgery, as are women who are pregnant with larger babies. \nDominguez-Bello and her colleagues have been swabbing newborn C-section babies with vaginal fluids from their mothers to see if this has a beneficial effect. She doesn\u2019t recommend the practice though, because she doesn\u2019t know yet if it works, and there is a risk that the procedure could cause infections.

They then repeated the experiment but had their partners stimulate them. Advertisement \nWise\u2019s custom-fitted head stabiliser allowed the team to follow brain activity in 20 second intervals to see what happens just before, during, and after an orgasm . Pain relief \nBack in 1985, Wise\u2019s colleagues Beverly Whipple and Barry Komisaruk , both at Rutgers, discovered that, during self-stimulation and orgasm, women are less likely to notice painful squeezing of a finger, and can tolerate more of this pain. They found that women\u2019s ability to withstand pain increased by 75 per cent during stimulation, while the level of squeezing at which women noticed the pain more than doubled. \nNow Wise\u2019s team has explained why. At the point of orgasm, the dorsal raphe nucleus area of the brain becomes more active. This region plays a role in controlling the release of the brain chemical serotonin, which can act as an analgesic, dampening the sensation of pain. \nHer team also saw a burst of activity in the nucleus cuneiformis, which is a part of brainstem systems that are thought to help us control pain through thought alone. \n\u201cTogether, this activity \u2013 at least in part \u2013 seems to account for the pain attenuating effect of the female orgasm,\u201d says Wise. Turn on, not off \nWise\u2019s team also found evidence that overturns the assumption that the female brain \u201cswitches off\u201d during orgasm . \nIn 2005, Gert Holstege at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands used a PET scanner to analyse brain activity in 13 women while they were resting, faking an orgasm and being stimulated by their partner to orgasm. While activity in sensory regions of the brain increased during orgasm, activity fell in large number of regions \u2013 including those involved in emotion \u2013 compared with their brain at rest. \nBased on this finding, it was suggested that women have to be free from worries and distractions in order to climax. From an evolutionary point of view, the brain might switch off its emotional areas because the chance to produce offspring is more important than the immediate survival to the individual. \nBut the new study saw the opposite: brain activity in regions responsible for movement, senses, memory and emotions all gradually increased during the lead-up to orgasm, when activity then peaked and lowered again. \u201cWe found no evidence of deactivation of brain regions during orgasm,\u201d says Wise. \nThe difference between the two studies may be because PET can only get a small snapshot of brain activity over a short period of time, unlike fMRI scanners. Better understanding \nIt\u2019s not yet clear why pain sensation decreases during orgasm, or if men experience the same phenomenon. It may be that, in order to feel pleasure in the brain, the neural circuits that process pain have to be dampened down. \nWhipple suggests that the pain-dampening effects of the female orgasm could be related to child birth. Her research suggests that pain sensitivity is reduced when the baby\u2019s head emerges through the birth canal. Vaginal stimulation may therefore reduce pain in order to help mothers cope with the final stages of birth, and promote initial bonding with the baby. \nThe ability to study what happens during stimulation and orgasm could be used to better understand and treat those who have mood disorders like anhedonia \u2013 the inability to experience pleasure, says Wise. \u201cWe know so little about pleasure in the brain, we are just now learning the basics.\u201d \nYou might wonder what it\u2019s like to participate in such experiments. Wise says people often think her participants must be exhibitionists, but it\u2019s not the case, she says. \u201cSome women do like that aspect, but most are doing it because it\u2019s empowering to them. Some find it difficult to orgasm, others don\u2019t. One of our participants in this experiment was a 74-year-old lady who had two fabulous orgasms in the machine.

From an evolutionary point of view, the brain might switch off its emotional areas because the chance to produce offspring is more important than the immediate survival to the individual. \nBut the new study saw the opposite: brain activity in regions responsible for movement, senses, memory and emotions all gradually increased during the lead-up to orgasm, when activity then peaked and lowered again. \u201cWe found no evidence of deactivation of brain regions during orgasm,\u201d says Wise. \nThe difference between the two studies may be because PET can only get a small snapshot of brain activity over a short period of time, unlike fMRI scanners. Better understanding \nIt\u2019s not yet clear why pain sensation decreases during orgasm, or if men experience the same phenomenon. It may be that, in order to feel pleasure in the brain, the neural circuits that process pain have to be dampened down. \nWhipple suggests that the pain-dampening effects of the female orgasm could be related to child birth. Her research suggests that pain sensitivity is reduced when the baby\u2019s head emerges through the birth canal. Vaginal stimulation may therefore reduce pain in order to help mothers cope with the final stages of birth, and promote initial bonding with the baby. \nThe ability to study what happens during stimulation and orgasm could be used to better understand and treat those who have mood disorders like anhedonia \u2013 the inability to experience pleasure, says Wise. \u201cWe know so little about pleasure in the brain, we are just now learning the basics.\u201d \nYou might wonder what it\u2019s like to participate in such experiments. Wise says people often think her participants must be exhibitionists, but it\u2019s not the case, she says. \u201cSome women do like that aspect, but most are doing it because it\u2019s empowering to them. Some find it difficult to orgasm, others don\u2019t. One of our participants in this experiment was a 74-year-old lady who had two fabulous orgasms in the machine.

The Atlantic and Pacific oceans are swallowed. Where once there were beaches, great mountain ranges judder into the skies, fusing together a scatter of separate land masses into one mighty new supercontinent. Call it\u2026 Aurica. \nThat\u2019s what Jo\u00e3o Duarte calls it, anyway. A geoscientist at the University of Lisbon, Portugal, he has his own distinct vision of how Earth may look 250 million years from now. He joins a band of fortune tellers gazing into the distant future, all with different ideas about how and where the next supercontinent will form, and what cataclysms might strike along the way. \nThe answer will determine Earth\u2019s future climate and prospects for sustaining life. But getting it right requires grappling with a machine whose workings we still understand only imperfectly: that of plate tectonics. \nEarth\u2019s surface is clad in rigid rock plates \u2013 together called the lithosphere \u2013 formed of surface crustal rock laminated on to hard cold mantle rocks. Given their rigidity, it is surprising that these plates don\u2019t simply lock together, unmoving. And indeed, until about 50 years ago geologists thought that Earth\u2019s land masses were fixed, despite German geophysicist Alfred Wegener having proposed the idea of continental drift in 1915. \nThe creation and destruction of ocean basins makes plate motion possible. Plates move apart at mid-ocean ridges, where molten rock rises and cools to form hard, dense basalt. They move together at subduction zones, where old ocean lithosphere plunges under a neighbouring plate . As it penetrates the warmer, softer mantle beneath, it causes earthquakes and feeds volcanoes. \nMagnetic signals recorded in sea-floor rocks, To continue reading this premium article, subscribe for unlimited access.

Here\u2019s his advice on how to sleep better and reap the benefits. Read more: Wake-up call \u2013 How a lack of sleep can cause Alzheimer\u2019s \nWhat\u2019s worse, fragmented sleep or shorter \u2013 but unbroken \u2013 sleep? \nWe have discovered that fragmented sleep, even if it is of a standard duration (for instance, 8 hours), can be damaging to emotional and cognitive functions . For example, a recent report demonstrated that disrupted sleep significantly lowers your mood . \nThat\u2019s because when your sleep is interrupted, you don\u2019t have time to go through all the restorative sleep stages. In particular, we are learning that deep, non-REM sleep is especially important in clearing plaques involved in Alzheimer\u2019s disease from the brain (see \u201c Wake-up call: How a lack of sleep can cause Alzheimer\u2019s \u201c). \nAs for shorter durations, just one night of insufficient sleep can have immediate effects. For example, a study limited healthy young adults to 4-hours of sleep for one night. The next day there was a measurable effect on their immune system. Specifically, participants had a 70 per cent decrease in critical anti-cancer immune cells, called natural killer cells. \nCan you undo the damage if you change your behaviour now?

So says a report on air quality from the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen, Denmark. \n\u201cAir pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe,\u201d says the EEA. \nBy far the biggest killer was PM2.5, the soup of tiny particles measuring 2.5 micrometres across or less. These claimed an estimated 428,000 premature deaths across the 41 European countries tracked in 2014. The main source, contributing 57 per cent of PM2.5 emissions in 2015, was domestic wood burning , especially in eastern Europe. Advertisement \nNitrogen dioxide, mostly from vehicle exhausts, cut short an estimated 78,000 lives across the same 41 countries. Ground-level ozone was the other major killer, claiming an estimated 14,400 lives prematurely . \n\u201cHeart disease and stroke are the most common reasons for premature death attributable to air pollution, and are responsible for 80 per cent of cases,\u201d the report says. Air pollution also contributes to other respiratory diseases and cancer, and has non-lethal impacts on diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, pregnancy and brain development in children. Hotspots of bad air \nThe two worst hotspots for PM2.5 pollution were Poland and northern Italy, where dozens of cities exceeded the EU\u2019s annual mean limit of 25 micrograms of particles per cubic metre of air. \u201cPoland and the Po valley have very bad pollution,\u201d says Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez Ortiz, the report\u2019s lead author. \nThe worst offender was the city of Krakow in Poland, where the PM2.5 value was 44 micrograms. Levels also reached 40 micrograms in Macedonia. More than a dozen Polish cities exceeded 30 micrograms, as did cities in northern Italy including Milan, Padua, Cremona, Brescia, Venice and Turin. \nIn all, 7 to 8 per cent of Europe\u2019s urban population was exposed to PM2.5 concentrations that exceeded the EU limit. But when the World Health Organization\u2019s stricter limit of 10 micrograms was used as a benchmark, between 82 and 85 per cent of urban Europeans were exposed. \nThe UK saw an estimated 37,600 premature deaths from PM2.5 exposure in 2014. The worst hotspot was 16 micrograms, along London\u2019s Marylebone Road, followed by 15 micrograms on a roadside in Haringey, north London. \nBut the UK also saw many premature deaths from exposure to nitrogen dioxide : about 14,000. This was compounded by widespread use of diesel fuel in vehicles . In one part of London, the annual limit for nitrogen dioxide was exceeded as early as 6 January this year . In September, London mayor Sadiq Khan triggered the capital\u2019s seventh emergency air quality alert since he introduced the system a year ago . Impacts from nitrogen dioxide were also high in Germany, France and Spain. \nOverall, emissions are falling, but slowly, says Ortiz. He says the air would get cleaner faster if countries further limited their numbers of vehicles, burned cleaner fuels for heating and created more pedestrianised areas. Ortiz also recommends adapting infrastructure to suit cycling and promoting wider use of public transport. \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "beata zawre", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sadiq khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberto gonz\u00e1lez ortiz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy coghlan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ortiz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european environment agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cremona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haringey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copenhagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brescia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krakow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macedonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marylebone road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T18:04:43.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96cee2b5b989f8b2fe790d02a595d01fff34ac18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXxUvJtc8JQewCEW7G6Aad_BoGY2N4Y.lWH81TcaB7cTsF59PwwsEI5SUDgstPL4H_KANx71ka2mmd5W0zdNy32GnG.wtM6QneA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/mental-health", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Perfectly preserved fossil salamander even has last meal in gut", "title_full": "Perfectly preserved fossil salamander even has last meal in gut", "published": "2017-10-12T18:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/12145818/salamander.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 345, "comments": 0, "shares": 345}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96cee2b5b989f8b2fe790d02a595d01fff34ac18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXxUvJtc8JQewCEW7G6Aad_BoGY2N4Y.lWH81TcaB7cTsF59PwwsEI5SUDgstPL4H_KANx71ka2mmd5W0zdNy32GnG.wtM6QneA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T18:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Perfectly preserved fossil salamander even has last meal in gut", "text": "Perfectly preserved fossil salamander even has last meal in gut Preserved frog bones from an ancient salamander\u2019s stomach J\u00e9r\u00e9my Tissier CC BY By Richa Malhotra \nThe fossil of an extinct salamander is so exquisitely preserved that the remains of its last meal \u2013 a frog \u2013 can be seen in its gut. \nThe fossil comes from the site of the Quercy phosphorites in south-west France, which has thrown up many vertebrate fossils over the years. This is despite a large number of specimens probably being destroyed by phosphate mining in the 19th and 20th centuries. \nThe salamander fossil had remained largely forgotten in the French National Museum of Natural History for decades, until J\u00e9r\u00e9my Tissier of the JURASSICA Museum in Porrentruy, Switzerland, and his colleagues took a closer look. \nThey scanned the fossil using advanced imaging techniques, and named it Phosphotriton sigei after the phosphorus-rich sediments of Quercy. It is the only known fossil of this species, with a search in museums and sediment deposits coming up empty. \nThe salamander died 34 to 40 million years ago, yet aside from its skeleton, many of its soft tissues are preserved: an initial examination identified skin and a lung. These were protected by a process called permineralisation, sometimes loosely known as \u201cmummification\u201d. Under this mechanism, minerals from groundwater seep into a buried animal and fill any empty pockets, or even individual cells. \nThis type of soft tissue preservation is rare, says Dean Lomax at the University of Manchester, UK. Frog-muncher \nWhen Tissier and his colleagues revisited the scan, they spotted other tissues, including digestive tract, nerves, muscles and an unidentified organ. But the \u201cbig surprise\u201d came when they examined the digestive tract and found frog bones inside. \nThose bones comprised four vertebrae and a 5-millimetre-long limb bone. \u201cIt was clear that they didn\u2019t belong to the salamander, because they were in the wrong position and too small,\u201d Tissier says. He isn\u2019t sure whether the frog bones all belong to the same individual, but they do not come from any fully developed adults. \nRegardless, the finding makes P. sigei the only extinct salamander known to have consumed frogs. \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t expect frog bones,\u201d says Tissier, because modern salamanders rarely eat those animals. \n\u201cThe frog was really small, which may have made it easier for the salamander to catch it,\u201d he adds. The prey was just 18-20 millimetres long, whereas the salamander may have been 150 mm \u2013 although the fossil is only about 60mm long because it is missing its head and parts of its tail and neck. \nMost present-day salamanders feed on invertebrates, with their mouths too small to consume large vertebrates, says herpetologist Sara Viernum . \u201cBut if they can fit a vertebrate prey in their mouths, they typically will eat it.\u201d The frog\u2019s small relative size may have doomed it. \nJournal reference: PeerJ , DOI: 10.7717/peerj.3861 \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dean lomax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara viernum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tissier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j\u00e9r\u00e9my tissier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richa malhotra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of manchester", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "porrentruy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T18:17:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "baa4fc7d02f4af4f915730b40a247edb0f7ac90d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX04RCUqZbwZC1xkJJJ9SySXZCGgzQMNSmOM3ZZqAeAtBd1JhJgxmBU2iK50sKF2HW1sPfAMVC413cpfAavntMmb55Epdc9XvXw--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/exploring-mars", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Did blind cavefish evolve by breaking the laws of evolution?", "title_full": "Did blind cavefish evolve by breaking the laws of evolution?", "published": "2017-10-12T18:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/12153411/fx2mjy.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1296, "comments": 0, "shares": 1296}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "baa4fc7d02f4af4f915730b40a247edb0f7ac90d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX04RCUqZbwZC1xkJJJ9SySXZCGgzQMNSmOM3ZZqAeAtBd1JhJgxmBU2iK50sKF2HW1sPfAMVC413cpfAavntMmb55Epdc9XvXw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T18:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Did blind cavefish evolve by breaking the laws of evolution?", "text": "Did blind cavefish evolve by breaking the laws of evolution? Evolutionary insight VPC Animals Photo/Alamy Stock Photo By Michael Le Page \nWe\u2019ve found out why a Mexican cavefish has no eyes \u2013 and the surprising answer is likely to be seized upon by those who think the standard view of evolution needs revising. \nOver the past few million years, blind forms of the Mexican tetra ( Astyanax mexicanus ) have evolved in caves. Maintaining eyes and the visual parts of the brain uses lots of energy , so the loss of eyes is a big advantage for animals living in the dark. Instead the cavefish \u201csee\u201d by sucking . \nIt was assumed that these fish became blind because mutations disabled key genes involved in eye development. This has been shown to be the case for some other underground species that have lost their eyes. Advertisement \nBut Aniket Gore of the US\u2019s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and colleagues haven\u2019t found any disabling changes in the DNA sequences of eye development genes in the cavefish. \nInstead, the genes have been switched off by the addition of chemical tags called methyl groups. This is what is known as an epigenetic , rather than genetic, change. \n\u201cAlthough a central role for DNA methylation in development and disease has been well-documented, our results suggest that epigenetic processes can play an equally important role in adaptive evolution,\u201d the team writes. Faster evolution? \nThe researchers propose that this epigenetic mechanism allowed the cavefish to shed its eyes faster than if the change had happened via DNA mutations in eye genes. \nThat is a controversial suggestion, and one that will be music to the ears of those who think that evolution can occur via heritable epigenetic mechanisms, and that standard evolutionary theory needs to be broadened to include such processes . \n\u201cThis is a most interesting paper,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Douglas Futuyma of Stony Brook University in New York. But he doesn\u2019t think it poses any challenge to standard evolutionary theory as the epigenetic change is itself most likely a result of a genetic change. \nGore\u2019s team shows that the silencing of the eye genes is due to the increased activity of a specific gene involved in methylation, Futuyma points out. So the question then is, what is making this gene more active? \n\u201cI think it likely that there has been an alteration in DNA sequence of that gene,\u201d he says. \n\u201cYou cannot completely rule out genetic mutations,\u201d says Eva Jablonka of Tel Aviv University, Israel, who thinks evolution can occur via epigenetic changes and that we need a new evolutionary synthesis. \u201cMaybe there was genetic variation that contributed to the eye loss.\u201d Lamarckian evolution \nHowever, Jablonka thinks that heritable epigenetic changes alone could explain the loss of eyes. What is more, she even thinks it possible that the epigenetic changes were somehow triggered by the cave environment in the first place. That would be a form of Lamarckian evolution: the idea that characteristics acquired during an individual\u2019s lifetime can be passed on to descendants. \nDavid Shuker at the University of Edinburgh, UK, is unconvinced by this or any of the other proposed examples of evolution via epigenetic mechanisms. \nThere is no doubt that some animals respond to the environment via epigenetic mechanisms, he says, but these mechanisms have evolved via genetic changes. \u201cIt goes through genetically built systems,\u201d Shuker says. \nSo, like Futuyma, he thinks standard evolutionary processes such as mutation and natural selection still explain all we have discovered. \n\u201cWe are always finding new ways in which these processes manifest themselves,\u201d says Shuker. \u201cWe have found lots of amazing things.\u201d But the basic principles remain valid, he says. \nShuker is suspicious of some efforts to promote the idea of an \u201cextended evolutionary synthesis\u201d. He thinks some people are trying sneak religious ideas back into evolutionary theory. \n\u201cThey are trying to allow organisms to have agency not controlled by genes,\u201d he says.

It\u2019s an important step toward finally letting people take home supportive exosuits after injuries, rather than having to stay in hospital. \nRobotic exoskeletons are often used for rehabilitation: they do your walking for you. Typically, they do this using motors placed at the joints, which transmit forces to rigid components that move the wearer\u2019s legs. \nThere\u2019s just one problem: they can\u2019t turn. All they can do is walk you in a straight line. \u201cHelping people to turn is really important, yet has rarely been addressed,\u201d says Steve Collins at Stanford University in California. Advertisement \nNow, Stephen John at Panasonic Research in Japan and his colleagues have tackled the problem. Their design, made from snug-fitting soft robotics , looks a bit like Spanx with an outboard motor \u2013 a pack on the back contains eight motors, batteries and a control system. Instead of joint motors driving leg movement, it has four actuators at the hips to control criss-crossing soft plastic wires that mimic the action of human muscles, which contract to generate movement. \u201cOne of the unique aspects of this exosuit is the way the fabric is wrapped around the legs to allow different combinations of motors to turn a leg,\u201d says Collins. \nIn preliminary tests, five able-bodied people tried out the exosuit with their eyes closed and in each case the suit could change direction without them losing their balance. John plans to do larger tests with people with disabilities. \nThe ability to change direction while walking will be key for take-home exoskeletons. \u201cBeing able to turn is important for home use,\u201d says John. \nOnce people who have had a stroke, for example, have recovered enough function in the clinic, they could wear the suit to move more naturally at home. It could also be a boon for older people, allowing them to live independently. \u201cThey could put it on the morning and wear it all day,\u201d says John. \nThe next step is to make the suit easier for the user to control. John is working on a sensor system that will detect when a wearer makes a slight turning motion, and complete the motion for them. He is also working on a way for the suit to sit down and stand up. \u201cOur goal is to assist with all the important movements that people encounter in their daily lives,\u201d says John. \nThe system was presented last month at the IROS conference in Vancouver, Canada.

The most precise measurement yet of an object on the far side of the galaxy\u2019s centre is paving the way for a definitive map of the other side of the Milky Way . \nIt\u2019s difficult to observe anything on that side of the galaxy because of the dense, frenetic swarm of dust and gas at its centre. Thomas Dame at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts and his colleagues got around this by looking at a jet of radio waves that can outshine any emissions coming from that mess of stars. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a very bright source, indicative of a flamboyant region of star formation, and these regions are almost always located in the spiral arms of the galaxy,\u201d says Dame. He and his team pinned down the source\u2019s location to the Scutum-Centaurus arm of the galaxy, probably one of the Milky Way\u2019s two major arms . Advertisement \nTo do this, they used parallax measurements, which take into account differences in measurements from two points in space. If you hold a finger up at arm\u2019s length and close one eye, then the other, your finger will appear to move over slightly \u2013 that small discrepancy is called parallax. The closer the object is to the observer, and the further apart the two observing locations, the larger the parallax. Building a better map \nThe object that Dame and his colleagues measured is so far away that to determine its parallax, they had to measure it over the course of a whole year, taking observations at either side of Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun. \n\u201cThese angles that are being measured are mind-boggling,\u201d says Dame. \u201cIn this case it\u2019s about 50 arcseconds, which is smaller than the size of Neil Armstrong\u2019s footprint on the moon viewed from Earth.\u201d \nThat tiny parallax angle corresponds to a distance of 66,500 light years. It\u2019s the furthest distance ever measured via parallax, and the first time it\u2019s been used for an object on the other side of the galaxy. \nSince much of our understanding of structure that part of the Milky Way comes from assumptions based on knowledge of the near side, parallax measurements may allow us to build a more accurate map of our entire galaxy . \n\u201cThe idea that you could be doing this for more objects on the far side of the galaxy is really exciting,\u201d says Robert Benjamin at the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater. \u201cHow can you talk about the structure of our galaxy when you only have half of it?\u201d \nDame says with this technique we could have an accurate and complete map of the entire Milky Way within 10 years.

So concludes an analysis of the genetic variants associated with skin pigmentation in people from several regions of Africa. The latest findings suggest that some particularly dark skin tones evolved relatively recently from paler genetic variants, underlining how deeply flawed the racist concept of people with whiter skin being \u201cmore advanced\u201d really is. \nNicholas Crawford and Sarah Tishkoff at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia recruited around 1500 ethnically and genetically diverse volunteers living in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Botswana for their study. Each person agreed to provide a DNA sample and have their skin pigmentation measured (pictured above). \nThe combined data allowed the team to find eight sites in the human genome that are particularly associated with the level of skin pigmentation. Together, these sites account for about 30 per cent of the variation they found in skin pigmentation among the volunteers. \nFor each of the eight sites of variation, there existed a genetic variant associated with paler skin, and a variant linked to darker skin. Seven of the paler skin variants emerged at least 270,000 years ago. Four of these arose more than 900,000 years ago. Plenty of variation \nThe latest thinking is that Homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago . The new findings mean that relatively pale skin tone variants predate the appearance of our species and have been retained in some parts of Africa ever since. \nThis might surprise some geneticists, says Tishkoff. Previous studies of a skin pigmentation gene called MC1R had led many geneticists to think that dark skin colour \u2013 which is thought to protect against UV damage \u2013 is a fixed and consistent trait in all people of African descent. \n\u201cThey thought [ MC1R ] shows that there has been selection for dark skin in Africa and therefore there\u2019s no variation,\u201d says Tishkoff. \nBut in retrospect, it\u2019s obvious that the story of skin pigmentation in sub-Saharan Africa is more complicated than that, as there is huge variation in skin colour across the continent today. The San hunter-gatherer populations of southern Africa often have lightly pigmented skin, and belong to one of the most ancient branches of the Homo sapiens family tree . \n\u201cI think the most interesting observation is that some ancestral light skin alleles are shared between the San and archaic hominins such as Neanderthals and Denisovans,\u201d says Carles Lalueza-Fox at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, Spain. \u201cThis suggests a shared, common ancestry for this trait before the split of these three hominin lineages.\u201d \nOf the darker-skin gene variants, three appear to have evolved from less pigmented variants.

Maintaining eyes and the visual parts of the brain uses lots of energy , so the loss of eyes is a big advantage for animals living in the dark. Instead the cavefish \u201csee\u201d by sucking . \nIt was assumed that these fish became blind because mutations disabled key genes involved in eye development. This has been shown to be the case for some other underground species that have lost their eyes. Advertisement \nBut Aniket Gore of the US\u2019s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and colleagues haven\u2019t found any disabling changes in the DNA sequences of eye development genes in the cavefish. \nInstead, the genes have been switched off by the addition of chemical tags called methyl groups. This is what is known as an epigenetic , rather than genetic, change. \n\u201cAlthough a central role for DNA methylation in development and disease has been well-documented, our results suggest that epigenetic processes can play an equally important role in adaptive evolution,\u201d the team writes. Faster evolution? \nThe researchers propose that this epigenetic mechanism allowed the cavefish to shed its eyes faster than if the change had happened via DNA mutations in eye genes. \nThat is a controversial suggestion, and one that will be music to the ears of those who think that evolution can occur via heritable epigenetic mechanisms, and that standard evolutionary theory needs to be broadened to include such processes . \n\u201cThis is a most interesting paper,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Douglas Futuyma of Stony Brook University in New York. But he doesn\u2019t think it poses any challenge to standard evolutionary theory as the epigenetic change is itself most likely a result of a genetic change. \nGore\u2019s team shows that the silencing of the eye genes is due to the increased activity of a specific gene involved in methylation, Futuyma points out. So the question then is, what is making this gene more active? \n\u201cI think it likely that there has been an alteration in DNA sequence of that gene,\u201d he says. \n\u201cYou cannot completely rule out genetic mutations,\u201d says Eva Jablonka of Tel Aviv University, Israel, who thinks evolution can occur via epigenetic changes and that we need a new evolutionary synthesis. \u201cMaybe there was genetic variation that contributed to the eye loss.\u201d Lamarckian evolution \nHowever, Jablonka thinks that heritable epigenetic changes alone could explain the loss of eyes. What is more, she even thinks it possible that the epigenetic changes were somehow triggered by the cave environment in the first place. That would be a form of Lamarckian evolution: the idea that characteristics acquired during an individual\u2019s lifetime can be passed on to descendants. \nDavid Shuker at the University of Edinburgh, UK, is unconvinced by this or any of the other proposed examples of evolution via epigenetic mechanisms. \nThere is no doubt that some animals respond to the environment via epigenetic mechanisms, he says, but these mechanisms have evolved via genetic changes. \u201cIt goes through genetically built systems,\u201d Shuker says. \nSo, like Futuyma, he thinks standard evolutionary processes such as mutation and natural selection still explain all we have discovered. \n\u201cWe are always finding new ways in which these processes manifest themselves,\u201d says Shuker. \u201cWe have found lots of amazing things.\u201d But the basic principles remain valid, he says. \nShuker is suspicious of some efforts to promote the idea of an \u201cextended evolutionary synthesis\u201d. He thinks some people are trying sneak religious ideas back into evolutionary theory. \n\u201cThey are trying to allow organisms to have agency not controlled by genes,\u201d he says.

For more than a century, it has been depicted as a sluggish, belly-dragging beast with sprawling legs \u2013 but it might actually have held its legs in a more upright position and kept its stomach off the ground as it walked. \nOften mistaken for a dinosaur, Dimetrodon actually belonged to a group called the pelycosaurs that were more closely related to mammals . It lived between about 290 and 272 million years ago , with some species measuring more than 3 metres from nose to tail. Its most iconic feature was a gigantic sail on its back, the function of which is still debated . \nNineteenth Century artists drew Dimetrodon as a sluggish-looking animal with legs sprawled out to each side of its body, resting its weight on an enormous belly \u2013 and even in the 21st century nothing much has changed. Advertisement \n\u201cI was baffled as I was going through the literature how little this had been questioned,\u201d says Caroline Abbott at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. It\u2019s particularly surprising given that the fossil trackways left by Dimetrodon seem to tell a different story. The relatively narrow distance between left and right sets of footprints suggest Dimetrodon did not have sprawling legs. \n\u201cThat\u2019s where the real head-scratcher is,\u201d says Abbott. \u201cThe trackways are more narrow than you\u2019d expect and in a lot of cases they lack belly dragging marks.\u201d Modern moves \nWith her colleague Hans-Dieter Sues at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, Abbott measured Dimetrodon bones, and looked at the configuration of the skeleton at the shoulder and the hip. She then compared this information with data collected from 11 living mammals \u2013 including the short-beaked echidna \u2013 and 12 living reptiles, including the Komodo dragon , the savannah monitor and the spectacled caiman. \nWhen Abbott and Sues used software to run their data, they found that Dimetrodon seemed to most closely match the caiman, a crocodilian that can hold its legs vertically enough to raise its body off the ground \u2013 particularly when it runs. Dimetrodon might have held its body in a similar way. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the best I have right now,\u201d says Abbott, who will present her findings at a meeting of the Geological Society of America in Seattle later this month. \u201cBut I\u2019m hoping that as I broaden the modern analogues I look at, and do more complicated stats, I can pinpoint that a bit better.\u201d Sprawling logic \nSpencer Lucas at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque agrees that Dimetrodon \u2019s posture needs a reassessment. He suggested as much in the late 1990s , after he and his colleague Adrian Hunt studied Dimetrodon trackways. \n\u201cWhen we wrote that paper we were just throwing the gauntlet down and saying: look, the trackways are showing something really different than anybody has thought from the skeletons,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t try to resolve it.\u201d \nHe says some palaeontologists did offer an explanation \u2013 that Dimetrodon thrashed its spine from side to side so much as it walked that it could leave narrow sets of footprints despite having sprawled legs. Abbott and Sues are suggesting a different solution, he says. \nLucas thinks the debate could be resolved by returning to the Dimetrodon trackways and using them to assess how fast the animals were moving. The \u201cthrashing spine\u201d idea assumes they were lumbering along slowly, whereas Abbott and Sues\u2019s reconstruction would be more consistent with an animal moving at speed \u2013 some crocodiles can run at more than 10 miles per hour. \n\u201cIf this is a pelycosaur moving quickly in a crocodilian-like fashion that would support [Abbott\u2019s] argument,\u201d says Lucas. \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T15:25:37.437+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2bb0e4c156237eccba9df2b275d40001c7849eef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX0pCEwBVHhdv5b31ZxwHkXYmoc9LY_mPIzwTBsouN1Zk1xcnW9Hzu3e27QFhLQ7pwKTSb1_893dVHy1aWNvTNoLk52N21T9zlA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/interviews", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Male chimpanzee seen snatching seconds-old chimp and eating it", "title_full": "Male chimpanzee seen snatching seconds-old chimp and eating it", "published": "2017-10-13T16:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/12175820/unknown-1.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5016, "comments": 0, "shares": 5016}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2bb0e4c156237eccba9df2b275d40001c7849eef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX0pCEwBVHhdv5b31ZxwHkXYmoc9LY_mPIzwTBsouN1Zk1xcnW9Hzu3e27QFhLQ7pwKTSb1_893dVHy1aWNvTNoLk52N21T9zlA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T16:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Male chimpanzee seen snatching seconds-old chimp and eating it", "text": "Male chimpanzee seen snatching seconds-old chimp and eating it Michio Nakamura By Jessica Hamzelou \nA rare sighting of a chimpanzee giving birth in the wild came to a grisly conclusion. Within seconds of the birth, the baby was snatched away and eaten by a male of the same group. The observation explains why female chimpanzees tend to go into hiding for weeks or months when they have their babies. \nLittle is known about how chimpanzees give birth in the wild because only five births have ever been observed, says Hitonaru Nishie of Kyoto University in Japan. Nishie and his colleagues have been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania\u2019s Mahale mountains for the last few years. Advertisement \nOne of the reasons so few have been witnessed is that the soon-to-be mothers often leave the group when the baby is due, and don\u2019t return until the infant is weeks or months old. This absence has been described as a chimpanzee\u2019s \u201cmaternity leave\u201d. \nSo Nishie and his colleague Michio Nakamura were surprised when, at around 11 am one December day, a female member of the chimpanzee group they were observing began to give birth in front of the 20 other members. \nAs soon as the baby was out \u2013 and before the mother had even had a chance to touch it \u2013 the baby was snatched away by a male member of the group, who then disappeared into the bush. The researchers found him around 1\u00bd hours later, sitting up a tree and eating the infant from the lower half of its body. He ate the entire body within an hour. Rare event \nThis is the first time anyone has reported seeing a newborn chimpanzee cannibalised in this way, says Nishie. He says that his observation provides an obvious clue as to why chimpanzee mothers tend to hide away to give birth. \nIn this case, the mother may not yet have had a chance to learn about \u201cmaternity leave\u201d if it was her first pregnancy, says Tatyana Humle at the University of Kent, UK. \u201cI would predict that she would go on \u2018maternity leave\u2019 next time,\u201d she says. \nIn fact, when the female chimp did subsequently have another baby (pictured above), she disappeared for a month. \nMale animals of many other species are known to kill young infants that aren\u2019t related to them. This allows them to mate with the mother, and to have more of their own offspring in the group. And female chimpanzees have also been spotted killing the infants of other females when resources like food are scarce, says Humle. \nThe baby chimp may simply have been a source of nutrition to the adult that snatched it, says Nishie. \nAt any rate, infanticide and cannabilism are extremely rare among chimpanzees, says Hulme. \u201cI work with a chimp community in West Africa, and I have never witnessed any cases,\u201d she says. Humle thinks that such violence may be more likely to occur in larger groups, where there is more competition for resources.

Good news, you may have the skills to work in cybersecurity . An online training platform launching next week in the UK \u2013 with the backing of Robert Hannigan, the former director of the country\u2019s GCHQ intelligence agency \u2013 is designed to make cybersecurity roles tempting to people, whatever their background. \nCyberattacks now bring organisations to their knees with worrying frequency. Earlier this year the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomwares shut down multiple organisations around the world. And in the last few weeks, details emerged of two of the biggest data hacks ever: the US credit reporting agency Equifax revealed that tens of millions of people\u2019s personal data had been stolen from it, and Yahoo admitted that a large hack in 2013 had compromised all of its 3 billion users\u2019 accounts. \nThere simply are not enough people with the skills to fend off such attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fill roles just from computer science students,\u201d says James Hadley, CEO of Immersive Labs, the UK company behind the new platform \u2013 the Digital Cyber Academy . Advertisement \nThe problem isn\u2019t just that there is a shortage of people studying computer science. \u201cIndustry relies heavily on tech products to reduce risk,\u201d says Hadley, but new tech isn\u2019t always the solution. People from non-technical backgrounds could bring new perspectives to what is as much a people problem as a computer one. \nHadley, who used to be teach cybersecurity, thinks that students with a wider range of experience would inject fresh ideas. Anyone good at analysing a situation, troubleshooting and problem-solving \u2013 or simply with perseverance and curiosity \u2013 fits the bill, he says. \n\u201cA strong grasp of the technology is valuable, but it\u2019s by no means sufficient,\u201d says Andrew Martin, director of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security at the University of Oxford. \u201cDecades of vulnerabilities in popular software products tell us that good software engineers can screw things up quite badly.\u201d Jobs via a leaderboard \nMartin thinks the Digital Cyber Academy is a good idea. For now, the platform is aimed at UK students, who can sign up here . It will offer a range of training courses from complete beginner level to advanced. Scores for completing exercises will be posted to a leaderboard. Companies will then be able to invite candidates who have reached a certain level of competence to apply for roles. \nHadley says the platform will be constantly updated with the latest developments. For example, an existing training platform that Immersive Labs sells to firms for internal recruiting added an exercise about the NotPetya ransomware on the day it hit. \u201cPeople could read about it in the morning and get their hands dirty in the afternoon,\u201d says Hadley. \nUltimately, Immersive Labs hopes to address entrenched preconceptions about cybersecurity. When Equifax revealed in September that it had been the victim of an attack that exposed the names, addresses and social security numbers of nearly half the US population, critics pounced on the fact that its head of security had a music degree. \n\u201cThat was hugely frustrating,\u201d says Hadley. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to remove these misconceptions.\u201d He says that music has formal patterns and logic that align quite well with cybersecurity. \u201cMany in cybersecurity are self-taught,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to encourage that behaviour.\u201d \nMartin agrees. \u201cMany cybersecurity issues arise from the realities of human nature or the way we organise society,\u201d he says. Fixing them requires a diverse set of skills. \u201cThe ideal security director is a polymath.\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert hannigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james hadley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hadley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yahoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital cyber academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centre for doctoral training", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gchq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "immersive labs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T18:17:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1cdf50d993d8d63417ce7de409ade12ae134338", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXzuGF2CeLmJxO9271TaXxjNr8z6Yo8Qk5aCnWCPX3yX.Wed2Z1MUkpVDq.PY7gG6BZpUShmmzMedyL6dAuJGDrR_SdCo_BJhqQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/sport", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Sperm age calculator tells men how decrepit their sperm are", "title_full": "Sperm age calculator tells men how decrepit their sperm are", "published": "2017-10-13T18:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13153540/p6240100-coloured_sem_of_human_spermatozoa.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 976, "comments": 0, "shares": 976}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1cdf50d993d8d63417ce7de409ade12ae134338", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXzuGF2CeLmJxO9271TaXxjNr8z6Yo8Qk5aCnWCPX3yX.Wed2Z1MUkpVDq.PY7gG6BZpUShmmzMedyL6dAuJGDrR_SdCo_BJhqQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T18:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sperm age calculator tells men how decrepit their sperm are", "text": "13 October 2017, updated 16 October 2017 Sperm age calculator tells men how decrepit their sperm are Sometimes age does matter Juergen Berger/SPL By Jessica Hamzelou \nA sperm age calculator can tell men how \u201cold\u201d their sperm are, using clues from DNA analysis, and has revealed some of the effects of smoking on sperm. \nWhile a woman\u2019s age has long been known to affect the health of her offspring, we have only recently begun to understand how a father\u2019s age can have similar effects. Older fathers are now known to pass on more genetic mutations to their children than older mothers do. And children of older fathers are more likely to have autism and schizophrenia . \n\u201cThe hope is that we could potentially screen people and say, \u2018your sperm is really old\u2019, and identify risks for the offspring,\u201d says Tim Jenkins at the University of Utah. Advertisement \nGrowing evidence suggests that older dads might pass on health risks through epigenetic tags on the DNA in their sperm. These tags alter how active genes are, and lifestyle factors such as diet and smoking are known to make epigenetic changes that may affect the next generation . Read more \u2013 Testicular time bomb: Older dads\u2019 mutant sperm \nAgeing is also a factor. Jenkins and his colleagues have studied the sperm of 350 men, looking for these genetic switches. So far, the team have found changes at 147 points in the genome that seem to be linked to a man\u2019s age. \nUsing this information, the team have created a \u201ccalculator\u201d that assesses the state of the DNA of a man\u2019s sperm at these 147 sites. Their analysis can predict a man\u2019s age with approximately 95 per cent accuracy, and identify whether a man\u2019s sperm have aged prematurely. \nJenkins and his colleagues have found that smokers have much older-looking sperm. \u201cFor a 40-year-old man who smokes, our calculator would calculate him to be 44 or so,\u201d says Jenkins, who will present his findings at the end of the month at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas. \nThe researchers don\u2019t yet know if these changes are responsible for the increased risks of autism and schizophrenia in the children of older men, but Michael Carroll at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK, suspects this is the case. \n\u201cThe emphasis on smoking has always been on the mother\u2019s side,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cBut it\u2019s becoming more evident that exposures in men can alter health. It\u2019s not just about how sperm swim or what they look like \u2013 there are changes at the molecular level which can affect the offspring.\u201d \nBecause sperm is produced throughout a man\u2019s life, there\u2019s a chance that men with old sperm might be able to reverse some of the damage, says Carroll. \n\u201cIf you have a male in his 30s or 40s who has a sperm age in the 50s or 60s, you\u2019d have to look at why that is,\u201d says Carroll. \u201cIf you could change those factors, you could possibly reverse the clock.\u201d Article amended on 16 October 2017 \nWe corrected the accuracy of the analysis \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "juergen berger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tim jenkins   utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carroll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica hamzelou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael carroll", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "american society of reproductive medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester metropolitan university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san antonio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T18:57:14.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b436917e8ad508b4a62f9eb5768476b71085ca24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX.gOU2tEh3Lf7hZYtjUqrtXFxCGonavdsuihT8.oL7Ii8DxMDwM8w14wxKESvyZc4Mj6K7IPGFJ0qabRdMa11GzFbJK1OTez8Q--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/cancer", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Magic mushroom extract changes brains of people with depression", "title_full": "Magic mushroom extract changes brains of people with depression", "published": "2017-10-13T18:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13155252/rexfeatures_2284965a.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 9630, "comments": 0, "shares": 9630}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 21}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b436917e8ad508b4a62f9eb5768476b71085ca24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX.gOU2tEh3Lf7hZYtjUqrtXFxCGonavdsuihT8.oL7Ii8DxMDwM8w14wxKESvyZc4Mj6K7IPGFJ0qabRdMa11GzFbJK1OTez8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T18:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Magic mushroom extract changes brains of people with depression", "text": "Magic mushroom extract changes brains of people with depression Self-medication isn\u2019t recommended Photofusion/REX/Shutterstock By New Scientist staff and Press Association \nPsilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound found in magic mushrooms , may help re-set the activity of neural circuits in the brain that are involved in depression. \nMagic mushroom enthusiasts have long believed that the drug\u2019s ability to induce profound-feeling experiences could be therapeutically useful. Brain-imaging studies have shown that psilocybin targets areas of the brain overactive in depression. \nLast year, Robin Carhart-Harris of Imperial College London and his colleagues conducted the first clinical trial of using psilocybin to treat depression , and got some encouraging results. The trial only involved 12 people and no control group, but the team found that after two sessions of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, all of the volunteers had reduced symptoms.

The study involved 19 people who had depression that had not been helped by conventional treatments. Mood reset \nEach volunteer was given a 10 mg and 25 mg dose of psilocybin, seven days apart. Brain scans showed that, after taking the drug, activity in some regions of the brain reduced. These areas included the amygdala, which plays a role in processing stress and fear. The participants reported an immediate improvement in mood that lasted for up to five weeks. \n\u201cWe have shown for the first time clear changes in brain activity in depressed people treated with psilocybin after failing to respond to conventional treatments,\u201d says Carhart-Harris. \u201cSeveral of our patients described feeling \u2018reset\u2019 after the treatment.\u201d \n\u201cThis is further evidence that psilocybin may turn out to be effective for the most stubborn depression,\u201d says Paul Morrison , of King\u2019s College London. \u201cDevelopments in this area are a priority in psychiatry.

An \u201cethical knob\u201d could let the owners of self-driving cars choose their car\u2019s ethical setting. You could set the car to sacrifice you for the survival of others, or even to always sacrifice others to save you. \nThe dilemma of how self-driving cars should tackle moral decisions is one of the major problems facing manufacturers. When humans drive cars, instinct governs our reaction to danger. When fatal crashes occur, it is usually clear who is responsible. \nBut if cars are to drive themselves, they cannot rely on instinct, they must rely on code. And when the worst happens will it be the software engineers, the manufacturers or the car owner who is ultimately responsible? Advertisement \nPeople\u2019s attitudes to the issue are also complicated. A 2015 study found that most people think a driverless car should be utilitarian , taking actions to minimise the amount of overall harm, which might mean sacrificing its own passengers in certain situations. But while people agreed to this in principle, they also said they would never get in a car that was prepared to kill them. Go \u201cfull altruist\u201d \n\u201cWe wanted to explore what would happen if the control and the responsibility for a car\u2019s actions were given back to the driver,\u201d says Guiseppe Contissa at the University of Bologna in Italy, who along with his colleagues has come up with a solution. \nThe team have designed a dial that will switch a car\u2019s setting from \u201cfull altruist\u201d to \u201cfull egoist\u201d, with the middle setting being impartial. They think their ethical knob would work not only for self-driving cars, but for all areas of industry that are becoming increasingly autonomous. \n\u201cThe knob tells an autonomous car the value that the driver gives to his or her life relative to the lives of others,\u201d says Contissa. \u201cThe car would use this information to calculate the actions it will execute, taking in to account the probability that the passengers or other parties suffer harm as a consequence of the car\u2019s decision.\u201d Me, me, me \nBut there are issues with the idea. \u201cIf people have too much control over the relative risks the car makes, we could have a Tragedy of the Commons type scenario, in which everyone chooses the maximal self-protective mode,\u201d says Edmond Awad of the MIT Media Lab, lead researcher on the Moral Machine project there. \nAnother concern is that people may be unwilling to take on moral responsibility. If everybody were to choose the impartial option, the ethical knob will not help with the existing dilemma. \n\u201cIt is too early to decide whether this would be a good solution,\u201d says Awad. But he welcomes a new idea in an otherwise thorny debate.

Flore-Ael Surun/Tendance Floue By Shaoni Bhattacharya \nWELCOME to the neontocracy: a world that revolves around the needs of children far beyond the basics of food and material comfort. Here, it is considered vital to maintain children\u2019s happiness, status, self-esteem and protection, and for parents to do their own childcare and schedule life-enhancing activities for their kids, providing constant stimulation. \nThe neontocracy is increasingly the ideal for the WEIRD world of Western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic societies. For anthropologist David Lancy of Utah State University (who coined the term neontocracy), this aim is an outlier that bucks the historical and ethnographic record, and in Raising Children , he picks apart the good and bad in WEIRD parenting. \nAbandoning harsh practices (sending the kids into the forest in hard times, or enslaving them) is surely good, but progressive virtues carry their own risks. The new ways, says Lancy, can leave many as kidults, ill-prepared to enter a complicated, adult world. They can even feed rising levels of mental illness, stress and suicide. \u201cNew ways of child-rearing can leave many as kidults, ill-prepared to enter a complicated, adult world\u201d \nWhile Lancy is clear that he is an anthropologist, not a peddler of childcare manuals, readers who are parents will still feel uncomfortably nudged. Another book, Lifelong Kindergarten by Mitchel Resnick, also offers parents similar fodder. Luckily, both books draw on more than psychology or neurology. Lancy\u2019s book is based on decades of anthropological research, while Resnick, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, concentrates on the relationship between kids and coding. \nIn some ways, both writers offer relief to hard-working WEIRD parents, exhausted by catering for their offspring in the high-maintenance regimes demanded both by current parenting movements and by ever-more prescriptive, anxious societies. Newer research seems to back the idea that parenting doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Both Lancy and Resnick cite developmental psychologist and writer Alison Gopnik, whose 2016 book The Gardener and the Carpenter shares similar insights. \nBut Lancy\u2019s book in particular delivers a cultural context that Gopnik\u2019s book lacked. And while Gopnik gently challenged Western parents, Lancy will have them choking on their lattes. Take one cornerstone of child development, attachment parenting. A strong emotional and physical attachment to at least one primary caregiver (parent, aunt, adopter and so on) is said to be crucial. Yet for most of history, and across all cultures to varying extents, the emphasis was for the mother not to get too emotionally invested in a newborn or young infant who might die or sap her energy and health, and consequently the well-being of the family or community. \nIn many cultures, found Lancy, it could not be taken for granted that a baby would be considered a person. The idea of delayed personhood is, in fact, common. Among the Sikkimese Lepcha people, a baby is considered as being still in the uterus for three days after birth and referred to as a \u201crat-child\u201d rather than human, while the Punan Bah see a child as little more than a body while its soul gradually takes residence, making it human. \nAnd we should recall that centuries ago, high infant mortality gave Western societies a more utilitarian view of the cost-benefit of children. Lancy cites a 6th-century Frankish law which decreed that the fine for killing a young woman of childbearing age was 600 sous, compared with just 60 sous for a male baby and a mere 30 for a female one. \nLancy\u2019s point is that modern practices \u2013 such as co-sleeping, on-demand feeding and constant parent-child play \u2013 now associated with attachment parenting should serve both parties or be abandoned. \u201cWe must not let the pendulum swing so far that other family members, or even the very fabric of family life, must suffer to stave off the dubious threat of reactive attachment disorder,\u201d he cautions. \nLancy also dismantles another aspect of the neontocracy: the way the West hails the uniqueness of every child. That, alongside an \u201ceveryone\u2019s-a-winner\u201d mentality, says Lancy, is doing children, society and the economy no good. Obsessed with children\u2019s happiness, US parents, \u201ctolerate mediocre academic performance and rail against teachers who expose our children\u2019s failings\u201d. In Connecticut, he says, teachers are banned from marking pupils\u2019 work with red ink to avoid damaging their self-esteem. \nWhile parenting styles promoting achievement and compliance with social or family rules, like that of the \u201cTiger mother\u201d , are met with a backlash, Lancy notes there is no evidence that high-achieving children are at particular risk of harm. But this doesn\u2019t mean we need more schooling or formal education. As Lancy says, our forebears thought learning through observation, play and autonomy were critical. \nCultures such as the nomadic Maniq hunter-gatherers of Thailand and Amazonian Matsigenka and Parakan\u00e3 still encourage children to practise using tools, knives and machetes. In our quest to shield children from harm, we may be undermining their natural inclination to learn adult survival skills, social and practical, and so extending childhood and \u201cfailure-to-launch\u201d. \nHappily, Lancy\u2019s research is so thorough and his writing infused with such gentle humour that even his admonishments and one-liners to parents are a pleasure. For example, advocating \u201cbenign neglect\u201d in parenting, he urges: \u201cGo ahead; try it. They\u2019ll thank you later on.\u201d \nThis is a fascinating book and, unusually for an academic work, my only criticism is that it was not long enough. There is so much more to know, particularly on the consequences of WEIRD societies\u2019 penchant for history-bucking parenting, with Lancy as a trustworthy, readable authority. \nLifelong Kindergarten takes its title from the research group Resnick heads at MIT\u2019s Media Lab. It promises so much: to shed light on how children and adults can be creative throughout life by learning from the ethos and practices of the kindergarten. \nLancy\u2019s basic assertion \u2013 how to harness kids\u2019 passions through collaborative projects and play \u2013 is clear in its implications for creativity. Many of his examples draw on the interactions of children in online communities exploring what they can do with the programming language Scratch. \nLike Lancy, Resnick highlights the shortcomings of the formal classroom. But while the book is insightful, it feels limited by focusing so much on the MIT group\u2019s work, and on Scratch and its online communities. \nResnick does allude to Gopnik, Piaget and stalwarts of creative play like the Denmark-based LEGO Group and even the woes of the Singaporean government in nurturing creativity in its high-achieving students. But a still wider perspective is needed. \u201cIn Connecticut, teachers are banned from marking work with red ink to avoid damaging self-esteem\u201d Childhood should be seen in cultural context Jonas Bendiksen/Magnum Photos \nIn one section, Resnick explores dichotomies in teaching and learning styles: between the idea that adult intervention should be formal, and a more hands-off approach. For him, children need balance between freedom and structure to optimise their creativity. And then there is the Silicon Valley idea of \u201cplaypen versus playground\u201d. \nWhile some computer games are like playpens, requiring children to advance through levels, others inspire creativity through virtual playgrounds. In Minecraft , for example, children can build their own structures and games, not unlike playing with physical Lego bricks. \nPlay \u2013 and the freedoms it unlocks \u2013 are key to Resnick and Lancy. For the good of all and for maximum creativity, it is time to unwrap the seedlings from the cotton wool in which we have enwrapped them, plant them in rich soil and make sure they don\u2019t grow up into another generation of overprotected kids.
