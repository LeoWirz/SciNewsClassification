Howard Broadman wanted to give a kidney to his 4-year-old grandson Quinn Gerlach, whose chronic kidney disease means he is likely to need a transplant within the next decade or two. \nWhen somebody needs a new organ, they go on a transplant list, but organs are in short supply. There are currently more than 93,000 people in the US waiting for a kidney, and 12 of these die waiting every day. One way to get around this is to have a friend or relative choose to donate a kidney directly to you. Advertisement Read more: Would you give one of your kidneys to a stranger? \n\u201cI know Quinn will eventually need a transplant, but by the time he\u2019s ready, I\u2019ll be too old to give him one of my kidneys,\u201d says Broadman. He says he first considered being altruistic, and simply donating a kidney to someone else. \u201cBut then I started thinking \u2018this is bullshit \u2013 I should get something for this\u2019.\u201d \nBroadman approached the University of California, Los Angeles, and asked them to give him a voucher for donating a kidney to someone now that will make his grandson more likely to get a transplant when he needs one in the future. UCLA surgeon Jeffrey Veale agreed, and set up a voucher scheme. \nVeale and his team\u2019s analysis of the scheme, published this month, suggests it really does encourage more people to donate kidneys. Veale says wider adoption of the scheme could lead to thousands more donations. Chain of donations \nA previous study found that over a third of people who require a transplant are unable to accept a kidney from a friend or relative willing to donate because of biological incompatibility . \nDoctors tackle this problem by matching up incompatible donors with other patients facing the same problem, creating long donation \u201cchains\u201d. Rather than giving directly to their incompatible loved ones, the relatives and friends give kidneys to each other instead, enabling everyone to find a match. \nEach voucher in Veale\u2019s scheme helps to get one of these chains started, sometimes enabling dozens more transplants. Broadman started a chain when he donated his kidney to Kathy DeGrandis, a retired airport manager. DeGrandis\u2019s sister previously hadn\u2019t donated because she was incompatible, but she then donated her kidney to a stranger , and that person\u2019s family then donated to someone else. \nEach donor was given a voucher that can be used by a loved one. The voucher doesn\u2019t guarantee a kidney transplant, but it gives a person high priority for being included in a donation chain when an appropriate match becomes available. \nWorking with the UCLA team, the US National Kidney Registry has so far issued 21 kidney vouchers across 30 hospitals, each one stimulating donation chains that have led to a total of 68 new transplants. \n\u201cIf only a fraction of the 40 million chronic kidney disease patients in the US had a donor like Judge Broadman, then tens of thousands of high-quality organs would enter the system,\u201d says Veale. \u201cFor the first time in history we could actually start reducing the waiting list .\u201d \nBut Joy Riley of the Tennessee Center for Bioethics and Culture says she is sceptical of a system that relies on \u201ctrusting in a piece of paper with no guarantees\u201d . Though the scheme has been approved by the medical board of the National Kidney Registry and is now offered in 30 hospitals, Riley says she would like to see a \u201cnational conversation\u201d before the scheme is rolled out further.

New simulations suggest that if a super-Earth existed in our own solar system, say between Venus and the Earth, far more asteroids would collide with us. But that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, if the timing is right. \nUnderstanding the effect of these massive planets on others nearby could help direct the search for life on exoplanets. Advertisement \nGiven that our galaxy is overrun with Super-Earths , Jeremy Smallwood at the University of Nevada and his colleagues set out to discover what their effect might be on neighbouring worlds, and what role one might play in a planet\u2019s habitability. \nThey ran simulations of the inner solar system\u2019s formation, shuffling the theoretical super-Earth around. They discovered that a super-Earth closer to the sun than we are would increase the number of asteroid impacts on our planet, while a super-Earth outside Earth\u2019s orbit would have the opposite effect. Why? A super-Earth near our sun would causes an asteroid\u2019s orbit to stretch out, making a collision with Earth more likely. A Game of Goldilocks \nIt may seem that the system with fewer asteroid impacts would be more conducive to life \u2013 but many astronomers argue the opposite. \n\u201c Asteroid collisions are thought to be destructive for life \u2013 that was definitely true for the dinosaurs,\u201d says Smallwood\u2019s PhD advisor Rebecca Martin . \u201cBut they are also essential for life.\u201d \nTake Earth\u2019s climate as an example. When our planet first formed, its orbit was eccentric \u2013 it might zip close to the sun for a short period and then spend long stretches of time in the cold outer regions of the solar system. But asteroid impacts helped to dampen these eccentricities and making our planet\u2019s orbit more circular, making the climate more stable. \nAstronomers also argue that the building blocks of life, like water, arrived on the first asteroids. In fact, the Earth\u2019s water is a chemical match for the asteroid belt\u2019s water, says Sean Raymond at the University of Bordeaux. Asteroids also might have sent heavier elements \u2013 like the iron that runs through our veins \u2013 toward the early Earth as well. \nSome scientists even suggest that life itself could have hitched a lift on these early asteroids, jumping from one planet to the next. \nStill an asteroid impact is a double-edged sword. A large impact might sterilise a planet, leaving it inhospitable for years to come. Raymond says that a planet needs a balance between too many asteroid impacts and too few. Smallwood calls this idea a new \u201cgoldilocks zone\u201d for habitability. \nStill, if astronomers discovered two exoplanetary systems \u2013 one where a super-Earth orbited inside that of a planet like our own, and one where a super-Earth orbited outside an Earth-like planet\u2019s orbit \u2013 Smallwood would search for life in the first system. Sure, he\u2019s taking a chance that the planet might be sterile. But the other world might not have received the necessary ingredients for life in the first place.

The US was insisting that North Korea scale down its nuclear programme, and this, said Kim In-ryong, had created a situation in which \u201cthermonuclear war may break out at any moment\u201d. \nIt was not the first time such warmongering talk had come from North Korean diplomats, but concerns over nuclear war have rarely been higher. Donald Trump has warned of a \u201cmajor, major conflict\u201d with the country. \nOn the face of it, such tensions might seem to bolster the case for maintaining a nuclear deterrent in the West.

The 90-year-old earthen dam houses a reservoir, 4 square kilometres in area and 4 kilometres long, which stores almost 40 billion litres of water. The reservoir is full to bursting, after Maria dumped 40 centimetres of rain on the surrounding mountains. \nIf the dam fails, it could cause life-threatening flash flooding downstream. Advertisement \nSince Friday, when the crack appeared, local officials have been warning of the danger and managing an evacuation. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to hold,\u201d Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 told the media on Sunday . \u201cThe integrity of the structure has been compromised in a significant way.\u201d \nUp to 70,000 people are being evacuated from the area. Dam experts contacted by New Scientist were full of praise for the evacuation plan. Dam bottom eroding \n\u201cPhotographs of the incident show there\u2019s structural damage at the base of the dam\u2019s spillway, where overflows appear to be eroding the bottom of the dam,\u201d says Tracey Williamson , chairman of the British Dam Society. Similar incidents and near misses have happened before. \u201cDepending on whether the overflow continues or increases for a significant amount of time, there\u2019s a possibility that erosion could progress to the point where the dam could breach.\u201d \nThere are several ways to stop the dam bursting. One is to reduce the reservoir level by draining water through all other available outlets: this would relieve the water pressure on the dam and slow the flow of water over the spillway. Another approach is to deploy high-volume pumps to divert the overflow around the zone of erosion. Finally, relief workers could jam additional material into the existing crack to prevent further erosion. \nThe crisis has also further depleted Puerto Rico\u2019s power supply, as the Guajataca lake supplies hydroelectric power as well as drinking water. \nAs of Sunday, the US Federal Emergency Management Agency had supplied Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands with 1.5 million meals, 1.1 million litres of water and 12,000 emergency roofing kits . \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "baez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy coghlan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricardo rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tracey williamson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us national weather service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us federal emergency management agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british dam society", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rio guajataca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guajataca dam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guajataca", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T16:25:10.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfdbe6d964ce09ca471450338885528d85ff0381", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLamYmRFVKzE5.LsakWVC2BstY_7Xcf33_2dePDjZJMT1geU9kJwbGq3kT3KZ2nOZkNgzzOlV5VKDur8FWhvgOb_WjTeB_RThG6A--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/60-seconds", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "A cheap pollution sensor will keep you off the dirtiest roads", "title_full": "A cheap pollution sensor will keep you off the dirtiest roads", "published": "2017-09-26T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/26130049/plume11.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 197, "comments": 0, "shares": 197}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 21}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfdbe6d964ce09ca471450338885528d85ff0381", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLamYmRFVKzE5.LsakWVC2BstY_7Xcf33_2dePDjZJMT1geU9kJwbGq3kT3KZ2nOZkNgzzOlV5VKDur8FWhvgOb_WjTeB_RThG6A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A cheap pollution sensor will keep you off the dirtiest roads", "text": "A cheap pollution sensor will keep you off the dirtiest roads Triple protection Plume Labs By Richard Schiffman \nA personal pollution guardian is here. Today the world\u2019s first low-cost wearable air quality sensor is for sale, capable of monitoring your exposure to the three most harmful pollutants. \nThe \u201cFlow\u201d device can be used as a handheld sensor or attached to pushchairs, purses and bags. It can be bought worldwide for under $200. \nThe sensor was tested by 100 volunteers this summer in central London. The crowdsourced results are now being used to map the air quality of more than 2000 kilometres of the city\u2019s pavements. \u201cWe want to help people take ownership of what they breathe,\u201d says Romain Lacombe, the CEO of Plume Labs , the Paris-based firm behind the device. Advertisement \n\u201cIt will certainly be the most complete,\u201d says Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Doussin at Val-de-Marne University in Paris, who has advised Plume. A few similar devices are already on sale, but Flow will be the first to be able to detect levels of the big three pollutants: volatile compounds, airborne particulates and nitrogen oxides . The device tells you whether they exceed safe levels on the street or in your home . \nPlume\u2019s sensors will work with a free mobile app to create pollution maps the same way we can now monitor traffic jams on our smartphones . These won\u2019t just rely on readings made by its users. Instead, air quality data will be melded with information on wind flow, temperature and other variables to forecast pollution hotspots. This could benefit those most at risk from bad air : young children, joggers and people with asthma and cardiovascular illnesses, whose lives may be endangered on heavily polluted days. Stay-at-home day \nGiving people precise information about their exposure will let them change their daily routine. For example, the parents of young children might decide to stay at home on high pollution days, joggers could take a different route or people with asthma could keep the windows open when they are cooking or using indoor fireplaces. \nAir pollution levels have been falling in many cities in Europe and the US as regulations governing vehicle exhaust and other emissions tighten. But Frederica Perera at Columbia University in New York says city dwellers should still be concerned. \u201cOur studies and those of other researchers have found no convincing evidence of a pollution threshold or safe level of exposure to common urban air pollutants,\u201d she says. Having a map of pollution hotspots means you can avoid them Plume Labs \nUntil recently, cities depended on a few fixed monitors to track air quality over vast urban areas. But these offered little insight to the average person because pollution varies from block to block due to the effects of trees, traffic patterns and architecture. \nRising concerns about the health effects of pollution, plus recent breakthroughs in sensing technology have spawned an explosion of cheap, portable monitoring devices. \nBut while many of these have launched over the past few years, the few that remain on the market only monitor one class of pollutants. That is largely due to space and data processing constraints, says Doussin. Street-level pollution maps \nRecent technological developments include nanowire gas sensors built into microchips in the Flow device. These are small enough to enable sensors for three key pollution components to be crammed into the device. \nThe Flow is one of a range of efforts to make high-resolution street-level pollution maps. The \u201cBiking and Breathing\u201d project in New York is now strapping wearable monitors on cyclists who volunteered to assess the health effects of biking around the city\u2019s streets. \nSmall mobile sensors have also been mounted on drones and balloons, and even pigeons to create 3D models of how plumes of pollution move through urban areas. This is all designed to give researchers \u201ca new, hyperlocal understanding of pollution\u201d, says Melissa Lunden of Aclima , an air monitoring company working with Google to track pollution in several Californian communities using equipment mounted on Google Street View cars. \nLunden hopes these new readings will give governments a tool to evaluate the impact of projects such as electrified bus lines, bike lanes and adding green space in congested urban cores. \nDoussin says smaller sensors like Flow are less accurate than the equipment scientists use, but they are \u201cmore than sufficient to evaluate personal exposure to air pollution\u201d. \nHe hopes that future versions of the device will detect ozone too and that the current sensor will create pressure on local officials to get serious about cleaning up the air. \u201cThe problem that we have with air quality is that it is an invisible problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThese devices make the invisible visible.\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "richar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "melissa lunden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frederica perera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-fran\u00e7ois doussin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doussin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romain lacombe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lunden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schiffman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "val-de-marne university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aclima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T17:15:09.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26d3f11856af2b9d13b127a5dc33335864c1dbdd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLauzl0sHGrNP2qOBCYq9tXyPuTfd7MgluTnuemGkvGC9qnDKQR3B3ZvlFCosKcrNZTfT2_DlY4nVwSCsNHUbOxApcdveG9P.Xlg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Genetically-modified wheat used to make coeliac-friendly bread", "title_full": "Genetically-modified wheat used to make coeliac-friendly bread", "published": "2017-09-26T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/26145647/new_superstock_4428r-13609.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 16067, "comments": 0, "shares": 16067}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 5}, "linkedin": {"shares": 182}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26d3f11856af2b9d13b127a5dc33335864c1dbdd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLauzl0sHGrNP2qOBCYq9tXyPuTfd7MgluTnuemGkvGC9qnDKQR3B3ZvlFCosKcrNZTfT2_DlY4nVwSCsNHUbOxApcdveG9P.Xlg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Genetically-modified wheat used to make coeliac-friendly bread", "text": "Genetically modified wheat used to make coeliac-friendly bread Daily bread: if gluten\u2019s not for you Superstock By Michael Le Page \nPeople forced to avoid gluten could soon have their bread (and cake) and eat it. Now there are strains of wheat that do not produce the forms of gluten that trigger a dangerous immune reaction in as many as 1 in 100 people. \nBecause the new strains still contain some kinds of gluten, though, the wheat can still be used to bake bread. \u201cIt\u2019s regarded as being pretty good, certainly better than anything on the gluten-free shelves,\u201d says Jan Chojecki of PBL-Ventures in the UK, who is working with investors in North America to market products made with this wheat. \nGluten is the general term for all the proteins in wheat and related cereals . During baking, these proteins link up to form elastic chains, which is what holds breads and cakes together as they rise. Advertisement \nBut some people have an autoimmune condition called coeliac disease . Their immune systems respond incorrectly to gluten, which damages the gut lining and can lead to diarrhoea, vomiting, malnutrition, brain damage and even gut cancers. \nNot all gluten proteins trigger this response, though: the main culprit is a group called gliadins. So Francisco Barro\u2019s team at the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture in Cordoba, Spain, set about getting rid of them. Acceptable bread \nThey used a genetic modification technique to remove 90 per cent of the gliadins in wheat. They did this by adding genes that trigger a process called RNA interference, which stops specific proteins being made. But because the gliadin genes themselves remain intact, in theory, there is a risk that the wheat could start making the crucial proteins again. \nSo Barro\u2019s team next tried using CRISPR gene-editing to get rid of the genes entirely. This is a huge task because there are no fewer than 45 copies of the gene for the main gliadin protein that causes problems. Nevertheless, Barro\u2019s team report that they have already managed to knock out 35 of the 45 genes. \nMore genes need to be disabled before the CRISPR strain is ready for testing, but it should be worth all the effort: the team have already shown that the GM wheat strain makes an acceptable bread. It cannot be used for making large sliced loafs, but is good enough for baguettes and rolls, says Chojecki. \n\u201cSome people will be very happy with this,\u201d says Sarah Sleet, head of patients\u2019 group Coeliac UK, not least because sticking to a gluten-free diet is difficult. \nHowever, others may not want to eat genetically modified foods, or to take the risk that some immune-triggering components remain in the wheat, Sleet says. \nSmall trials of the GM wheat involving 10 and 20 people with coeliac disease are already being carried out in Mexico and Spain. \u201cAll I can say is that the results are very encouraging,\u201d says Chojecki.

Evaporating water could supply enormous volumes of clean electricity, if we can only harness it. \nEvaporation is the process by which liquids turn into gases, generally when they are heated up. Every day, vast amounts of water evaporate from lakes and rivers, powered by heat energy from the sun. The scale of this energy is considerable. \nWater that evaporates from existing lakes and dams in the US \u2013 excluding the Great Lakes \u2013 could provide up to 2.85 billion megawatt hours of electricity per year, according to Ozgur Sahin of Columbia University and colleagues. That is the equivalent of two-thirds of US electricity generation in 2015. In 15 of the 47 US states studied, the potential power exceeds demand. Advertisement \nCovering freshwater bodies with engines that harness evaporation would halve water lost in this way, the team says. In seven US states, this would save more water than the entire state consumes. But the calculations assume that all the water is covered \u2013 which we would not want to do. \nEvaporation engines could also be put in other areas, from irrigated fields and greenhouses to sheltered bays, says Sahin. \nBut first an evaporation engine needs to be built. Sahin\u2019s team has created several miniature prototypes. \nThe prototypes are all based on materials that shrink as they dry, such as tape coated with bacterial spores. The spores curl as they dry, shortening the tape. \u201cThey work like a muscle,\u201d says Sahin. \u201cThey can push and pull with a lot of force.\u201d \nTo avoid being repeatedly soaked in water and becoming contaminated with dirt and chemicals, the prototypes exploit changes in humidity . \nIn one version, the \u201cmuscle\u201d sits just above the water. When shutters above it are closed, the humidity rises and the material expands. That opens the shutters, allowing the material to dry out and shrink, and so on. \nSuch evaporation engines can run at night as well as day. Normally, there would be less evaporation at night, but blocking evaporation during the day stores energy in the form of warm water. \u201cAt night you take advantage of this power,\u201d says Sahin. \u201cThis is a great advantage.\u201d Engine problems \nOthers agree that the potential is huge. The issue is harnessing it . \n\u201cThe question is whether there is any practical way to capture that energy,\u201d says Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, California. He doubts it is possible to efficiently convert evaporation energy into electrical energy. \nWhat\u2019s more, developing evaporation engines to the point where they can be mass-produced is a huge task, and one that few groups are working on. \nThe technology would also have to compete directly with solar panels, as it is increasingly common for floating solar farms to be placed on reservoirs. But evaporation engines could be made from cheap biological materials that are easier to dispose of than solar panels, says Sahin. \nIf the technology does take off in a big way, it could affect local weather by reducing evaporation. But it will only make a difference if an area of 250,000 square kilometres is covered, the team calculates. At large scales, all forms of energy production, from wind to nuclear, can affect weather and climate . \nBesides, in a world of increasingly extreme rainfall, reducing evaporation could be desirable in some places. \nJournal reference: Nature Communications , DOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-00581-w Article amended on 28 September 2017 \nWe have corrected the amount of megawatt hours of electricity that could be provided from water evaporation from lakes and reservoirs in the US \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sahin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael le page", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken caldeira", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carnegie institution for science in stanford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great lakes", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T20:01:58.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07d434aa1a4ef4208f1d24bc57a77818902e97cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLajVPXkJYgMnfw92srCh9E_PsT9su6CkbQ6ZFjhdyKwiZMzqhLYlYGxQHNAVGseOsqWaFPOvJwIQ8XW4MSpAHC89zgptH4V5sMA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/teenagers", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Packs of killer penguins herd fish into balls then pick them off", "title_full": "Packs of killer penguins herd fish into balls then pick them off", "published": "2017-09-27T03:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/26230137/00000-00562572.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 570, "comments": 0, "shares": 570}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07d434aa1a4ef4208f1d24bc57a77818902e97cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLajVPXkJYgMnfw92srCh9E_PsT9su6CkbQ6ZFjhdyKwiZMzqhLYlYGxQHNAVGseOsqWaFPOvJwIQ8XW4MSpAHC89zgptH4V5sMA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T03:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Packs of killer penguins herd fish into balls then pick them off", "text": "Packs of killer penguins herd fish into balls then pick them off Bait ball Peter Verhoog, Buiten-beeld/Minden Pictures/FLPA RM By Sam Wong \nBirds of a feather fish together \u2013 if they\u2019re African penguins . By doing so they catch more food while expending less energy. \nAfrican penguins were believed to forage in groups, but nobody had ever seen them hunt underwater. To find out how they catch common fish in their habitat, like schools of sardines and anchovies, Alistair McInnes of Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, South Africa, and colleagues attached cameras to 12 of the birds. \nOn most dives the penguins pursued single fish, but sometimes they teamed up for bigger rewards. Groups of penguins were seen herding schools of fish towards the surface, corralling them into a \u201cbait ball\u201d. Any fish trying to escape would peel off from the group, making them easy prey. The penguins\u2019 plumage \u2013 black on the back, white at the front \u2013 probably makes it difficult for the fish to see them coming from below. Advertisement \nThe researchers calculated how efficient the penguins were by dividing the number of fish caught by the time spent foraging. When hunting a school of fish as a group, penguins were 2.7 times as efficient as when they attacked on their own.

At the simplest level, animals like swordfish collaborate to slash at fish with their bills , killing more fish this way. At a more sophisticated level, creatures like dolphins communicate and coordinate their activity . \nPenguins aren\u2019t cooperating like dolphins, but they may be more advanced than swordfish, says McInnes. At the surface, they communicate to find other birds and synchronise their dives. \n\u201cThis study provides the first evidence that penguins are actively interacting with other individuals to enhance hunting efficiency,\u201d says Yuuki Watanabe at the National Institute of Polar Research, Japan.

Pictured above, it was thought to be an introduced species and plans were afoot to wipe it out. Now it turns out to be a species unique to the island, one that should be conserved. \nThe cobra-preta, as local people call it (the name is Portuguese for \u201cblack snake\u201d), lives on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. The people also have a saying about it: homem mordido, homem perdido , or \u201cman bitten, man lost\u201d. \nThe cobra-preta was long thought to be the forest cobra ( Naja melanoleuca ), a black snake with a mottled white collar, found in mainland Africa. Regarded as the largest cobra in the world, the forest cobra can reach 3 metres in length. Advertisement \nThe story was that Portuguese farmers introduced the cobra-preta to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 to control rats. This seemed odd to Luis Cer\u00edaco of Villanova University in Pennsylvania. \u201cWhy would you introduce the deadliest snake in Africa to an island?\u201d he asks. Read more: Four-legged fossil holds secret of snake\u2019s slithering origins \nCer\u00edaco found a report from 1540, which included an account of a visit to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 by a Portuguese explorer in 1506, when it was being colonised. The explorer described a black snake that was \u201cso venomous that when it bites a man, his eyes will explode out of the head and he will die\u201d. That was undoubtedly the cobra-preta, Cer\u00edaco says, albeit depicted with eye-popping hyperbole. Mariana Marques \nWhen Cer\u00edaco (pictured above with a forest cobra) looked closely at cobra-pretas, he found they tended to be even larger than forest cobras and that the scales on their underside had far less white. Genetic analysis confirmed that the cobra-preta is a new species, one Cer\u00edaco has named Naja peroescobari . \n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty incredible,\u201d says Cer\u00edaco. \u201cIt\u2019s like discovering a new crocodile\u2026 It doesn\u2019t happen every day.\u201d Read more: Snakes outpacing other invertebrates in race to evolve \nThe discovery came at the right time, says Cer\u00edaco. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 is becoming more conservation-conscious and the cobra-preta could have been earmarked for eradication, since it did not appear to be a native species. Locals already target and kill the snakes because of their deadly bites, Cer\u00edaco says. Some, however, catch and eat them as a delicacy. \n\u201cI think it says a lot that the type specimen, which is considered the gold standard in taxonomic research, is a snake that was chopped in half by a local resident of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9,\u201d says Rayna Bell of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, who has worked on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9. \u201cClearing up the misconception that the cobra-preta doesn\u2019t belong on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 will be an important first step towards conserving these unique snakes.\u201d Journal reference: Zootaxa , DOI: 10.11646/zootaxa.4324.1.7 \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tiziano", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mariana marques  when cer\u00edaco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean mowbray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luis cer\u00edaco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naja melanoleuca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cer\u00edaco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rayna bell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "villanova university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smithsonian institution", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s\u00e3o tom\u00e9", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf of guinea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cer\u00edaco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T15:59:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "517469ef4509a33977f12a8befd0634ba11f0f44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLar.wKnQfelM0YdcgQEOss6etjm_IHTBLrccOfYspuhco6AA68CtvoSM5pEAGD_VFbSuVZbWE0pEXSiEfnbC.CgEobhOxMQtcfw--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Serving shark fin soup in the US can actually be good for sharks", "title_full": "Serving shark fin soup in the US can actually be good for sharks", "published": "2017-09-27T16:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27133805/gettyimages-493750253.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 676, "comments": 0, "shares": 676}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "517469ef4509a33977f12a8befd0634ba11f0f44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLar.wKnQfelM0YdcgQEOss6etjm_IHTBLrccOfYspuhco6AA68CtvoSM5pEAGD_VFbSuVZbWE0pEXSiEfnbC.CgEobhOxMQtcfw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T16:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Serving shark fin soup in the US can actually be good for sharks", "text": "27 September 2017 Serving shark fin soup in the US can actually be good for sharks A proposed US ban on the sale of shark fins could backfire and make life worse for some of the planet's most imperilled species, says Lesley Evans Ogden The practice of cutting off shark fins for use in soup is highly controversial Robertus Pudyanto/Getty Images \nOne of the most controversial and hotly debated topics in shark conservation is finning \u2013 cutting off a shark\u2019s fins and dumping its body at sea.

Officially, it is known only from a handful of fossils found in Chad in 2001: a few teeth, parts of two lower jaws and, most importantly, a single, relatively complete skull. \nFeatures at the skull\u2019s rear suggest it sat atop a vertical spine like that of a human, hinting that S. tchadensis walked upright. To make sure, other fossils will be needed \u2013 particularly from the legs. Unconfirmed reports suggest that a thigh bone was found with the skull , but this has not yet been discussed in a scientific paper. With so little evidence to go on, some are sceptical that S. tchadensis can really yet be defined as a hominin rather than some other form of ape \u2013 yet. \nOrrorin tugenensis : the thighbone\u2019s connected to the\u2026? \nDiscovered in western Kenya , largely in 2000, O. tugenensis is officially known from a baker\u2019s dozen of fossils , six of which are teeth. The others include a finger bone, two jaw fragments, parts of three thighbones and a fragment of an upper arm bone. Most research has focused on one of the thighbones, and whether it shows that O. tugenensis walked upright on two legs like other hominins. Many argue that it was at least beginning to become bipedal . More fossil evidence could settle the matter. \nKenyanthropus platyops : a face for toolmaking? \nUnearthed in 3.3-million-year-old deposits in north-west Kenya, mostly in 1998 and 1999, K. platyops is best known from a mostly complete but squashed and distorted skull . A few dozen other fossil fragments were found at the same time \u2013 mostly teeth, but also pieces of a second skull, and parts of a few upper and lower jaws. \nAlthough all the K. platyops fossils found so far come from above the neck, very primitive stone tools were later found in the same rocks . K. platyops might have made these, but one researcher has suggested that the toolmaker could instead have been a hominin called Australopithecus deyiremeda \u2013 another enigmatic species known from no more than a few jaw fragments . \nHomo rudolfensis : is it even a species? \nMost researchers believe that our human genus emerged in Africa between 2 and 3 million years ago \u2013 but there is no agreement on how many species of early human shared the landscape. Homo rudolfensis sits at the centre of the controversy. \nFor decades, H. rudolfensis was known only from a distinctive 1.9-million-year-old large-brained, flat-faced skull discovered in 1972 in Kenya . Three additional face and jaw fossils found in Kenya between 2007 and 2009 helped confirm to some researchers that the 1972 skull really did belong to a distinct species \u2013 but others (including Lee Berger, discoverer of A. sediba and H. naledi ) are sceptical. \nEven the species name is controversial: it was established in the late 1970s by a Russian researcher not involved in the discovery of the 1972 skull. The researchers who analysed the three more recently found fossils say we need more fossil material before we can confirm whether the H. rudolfensis name is valid \u2013 or whether the species really belongs in our human genus . \nDenisovans: last and definitely least \nFrom a fossil perspective, Denisovans are the least-known of all ancient hominins. To date, just four tiny fossils have been confirmed as belonging to them \u2013 three teeth and one finger bone, all between 50,000 and 225,000 years old. \nAll four fossils, which came from the Denisova cave in Siberia, preserved enough DNA to confirm that they belong to the same genetic pool.

The observation comes on the tail of rumours of a possible detection of neutron stars merging , which could cause gravitational waves we can observe on Earth. But that\u2019s not what they found. \nOn 14 August, the Virgo detector and the two US detectors that make up the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) all observed the ripples in space-time caused by two black holes smashing into each other and merging. \nThis is the fourth gravitational wave detection ever. All four have come from pairs of black holes spiraling towards one another and then colliding, their colossal masses warping space-time as they merge. Like its forerunner, LIGO, Virgo spotted its first gravitational wave shortly after it began taking data.

They are located about 1.8 billion light years away from Earth in the direction of the constellation Eridanus in the southern sky. \n\u201cThree detectors is not just a little bit better than two; it gives us radically better information about the location of the source and what\u2019s going on with the source,\u201d says Kenneth Strain, a member of the LIGO collaboration at the University of Glasgow. \u201cThe numbers we can get now are much more precise than before.\u201d \nResearchers have been able to narrow down the location of this new gravitational wave, called GW170814, to an area of 60 square degrees in the sky. That\u2019s 300 times the area of the full moon viewed from the surface of the Earth. It may still seem like a large expanse, but the addition of Virgo allows scientists to triangulate the location of a signal. In this case, they have been able to narrow the possible regions of sky that could host the source of the gravitational waves by 10 times more than with LIGO alone. \n\u201cThis is just the beginning of observations with the network enabled by Virgo and LIGO working together,\u201d said LIGO spokesperson David Shomaker . \u201cWith the next observing run planned for fall 2018 we can expect such detections weekly or even more often.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "virgo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenneth strain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david shomaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leah crane", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ligo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virgo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:04:05.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9374453b1bc1649b3988b411a2219d041f3c695e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLagw5.Dck9srffj37zKYDFlBCjIdHZJ3Emgs_6J86ZIFWi.76G0m_98UzItv8vG1sJY0CRMPcGy5nDCbGgCyrPFe58glsgKf_sg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/cosmology", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "A few cold drops falling through a cloud could create a downpour", "title_full": "A few cold drops falling through a cloud could create a downpour", "published": "2017-09-27T20:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27171321/gettyimages-499429203.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 321, "comments": 0, "shares": 321}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9374453b1bc1649b3988b411a2219d041f3c695e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLagw5.Dck9srffj37zKYDFlBCjIdHZJ3Emgs_6J86ZIFWi.76G0m_98UzItv8vG1sJY0CRMPcGy5nDCbGgCyrPFe58glsgKf_sg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T20:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "A few cold drops falling through a cloud could create a downpour", "text": "A few cold drops falling through a cloud could create a downpour A chilly start? By Leah Crane \nA lab-made cloud has thrown light on a mysterious rain-creating phenomenon first witnessed decades ago. \nAtmospheric scientists haven\u2019t fully understood the mechanism by which a single cold droplet or ice shard can trigger abrupt rain or snowfall \u2013 as it did in an experiment in the 1940s when scientists dropped chunks of dry ice from an aeroplane through cumulus clouds. \nNow, Prasanth Prabhakaran at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in Germany and his colleagues have used an artificial cloud in a box to simulate the phenomenon, finding that a falling drop of cold water can trigger the growth of minuscule droplets along its path. Advertisement \nIn real clouds, water drops generally grow by sticking to aerosol particles. But Prabhakaran and his colleagues created artificial clouds in which liquid droplets at high pressure can grow on their own without the need for any aerosols, whose addition would also have made the cloud difficult to model. Make it rain \nTo further simplify the experiment, the researchers used two chemical stand-ins. Helium took the part of nitrogen and other gases, while sulphur hexafluoride played the role of atmospheric water, because it can be both a liquid and a vapour, and it forms droplets at lower temperatures and pressures than water. The cloud was created in a special box with a heated bottom and a top that was 4 \u00b0 C cooler. \nSome sulphur hexafluoride formed a pool at the bottom of the box, while some evaporated into the helium gas above. Drops of sulphur hexafluoride condensed on the ceiling of the box and dropped back down through the gaseous cloud. \nBecause the drops had formed on the cooled top of the box, they were colder than the surrounding gas. As a drop fell , it cooled the area around it. That caused lots of \u201cmicrodroplets\u201d to form in its wake, just as condensation forms on a cold can when it comes into contact with warmer air. \nPrabhakaran and his colleagues say this mechanism could help explain some abrupt rainstorms. Depending on atmospheric conditions, microdroplets produced this way in real clouds could merge until they are big enough to fall as a raindrop, or be swept into an updraft and then create microdroplets of their own. In the clouds \nBut because clouds have turbulent flows of air and varying temperatures, and because they contain particles of different sizes, it is tough to tell how realistic this model is. \n\u201cI see little relevance of this study to real-world clouds,\u201d says Daniel Rosenfeld at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. Because the artificial cloud is so small, the processes that happen there may not scale up to the size of actual clouds in Earth\u2019s atmosphere , he says. \nJonathan Crosier at the University of Manchester, UK, says if this is what happens in real clouds, it may be a rare phenomenon. \n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s an important process in terms of understanding how 99.9 per cent of the droplets in a cloud are formed,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, to really know, detailed simulations are needed in a very wide range of scenarios.\u201d Journal reference: Physical Review Letters , DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.128701 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:04:10.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ed66f390587a8343beec00c9d79508ee4a292da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXoz_K8m99zx3ll6gOMyw9O7NPkDVpBwcRVRS6nQkaSdnC_DtA1ld3Clq_rvL65ybQn0pXB6OW2oSokQ2Gd2m6bCBj54kU2tGuvJ3owhLYbu7H", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Editing \u2018bad\u2019 gluten out of wheat makes it safer for coeliacs", "title_full": "Editing \u2018bad\u2019 gluten out of wheat makes it safer for coeliacs", "published": "2017-09-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27180000/superstock_4428r-13609.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 466, "comments": 0, "shares": 466}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ed66f390587a8343beec00c9d79508ee4a292da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXoz_K8m99zx3ll6gOMyw9O7NPkDVpBwcRVRS6nQkaSdnC_DtA1ld3Clq_rvL65ybQn0pXB6OW2oSokQ2Gd2m6bCBj54kU2tGuvJ3owhLYbu7H", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Editing \u2018bad\u2019 gluten out of wheat makes it safer for coeliacs", "text": "Editing \u2018bad\u2019 gluten out of wheat makes it safer for coeliacs Daily bread: if gluten\u2019s not for you Superstock By Michael Le Page \nPEOPLE forced to avoid gluten could soon have their bread (and cake) and eat it. Now there are strains of wheat that do not produce the forms of gluten that trigger a dangerous immune reaction in as many as 1 in 100 people. \nBecause the new strains still contain some kinds of gluten, though, the wheat can still be used to bake bread. \u201cIt\u2019s regarded as being pretty good, certainly better than anything on the gluten-free shelves,\u201d says Jan Chojecki of PBL-Ventures in the UK, who is working with investors in North America to market products made with this wheat. \nGluten is the general term for all the proteins in wheat and related cereals. During baking, these proteins link up to form elastic chains, which is what holds breads and cakes together as they rise. Advertisement \nBut some people have an autoimmune condition called coeliac disease . Their immune systems respond incorrectly to gluten, which damages the gut lining and can lead to diarrhoea, vomiting, malnutrition, brain damage and even gut cancers. \nNot all gluten proteins trigger this response, though: the main culprit is a group called gliadins. So Francisco Barro\u2019s team at the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture in Cordoba, Spain, set about getting rid of them. \nThey used a genetic modification technique to remove 90 per cent of the gliadins in wheat. They did this by adding genes that trigger a process called RNA interference, which stops specific proteins being made. But because the gliadin genes themselves remain intact, in theory, there is a risk that the wheat could start making the crucial proteins again. \nSo Barro\u2019s team next tried using CRISPR gene-editing to get rid of the genes entirely. This is a huge task because there are no fewer than 45 copies of the gene for the main gliadin protein that causes problems. Nevertheless, Barro\u2019s team report that they have already managed to knock out 35 out of the 45 genes ( Plant Biotechnology Journal, doi.org/cdfd ). \u201cIt cannot be used for making large sliced loafs, but is good enough for baguettes and rolls\u201d \nMore genes need to be disabled before the CRISPR strain is ready for testing, but it should be worth all the effort: the team have already shown that the GM wheat strain makes an acceptable bread. It cannot be used for making large sliced loafs, but is good enough for baguettes and rolls, says Chojecki. \n\u201cSome people will be very happy with this,\u201d says Sarah Sleet, head of patients\u2019 group Coeliac UK, not least because sticking to a gluten-free diet is difficult. \nHowever, others may not want to eat genetically modified foods , or to take the risk that some immune-triggering components remain in the wheat, Sleet says. \nSmall trials of the GM wheat involving 10 and 20 people with coeliac disease are already being carried out in Mexico and Spain. \u201cAll I can say is that the results are very encouraging,\u201d says Chojecki. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cModified wheat for gluten-free bread\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael le page", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jan chojecki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chojecki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah sleet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francisco barro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coeliac uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for sustainable agriculture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plant biotechnology journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cordoba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:18:52.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9819fcdc3f3b4213af88cfc2aeb1dcdcfbab2b96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXoz_K8m99zx3l4bSEFrlinAuvzMLZG66rerEmT3b4mlE.SOapwDMMJR2Wj3qTa8r1lAVoYB7Tftx2ccusM_fQQMB7lYPoERZk_GKPG2IFaywg", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "EU plan to erase digital borders will further isolate Brexit UK", "title_full": "EU plan to erase digital borders will further isolate Brexit UK", "published": "2017-09-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27180000/36530595573_e5be2b64d0_o.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 148, "comments": 0, "shares": 148}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9819fcdc3f3b4213af88cfc2aeb1dcdcfbab2b96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXoz_K8m99zx3l4bSEFrlinAuvzMLZG66rerEmT3b4mlE.SOapwDMMJR2Wj3qTa8r1lAVoYB7Tftx2ccusM_fQQMB7lYPoERZk_GKPG2IFaywg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "EU plan to erase digital borders will further isolate Brexit UK", "text": "27 September 2017 EU plan to erase digital borders will further isolate Brexit UK Estonia wants the European Union to adopt free movement of data as a fundamental principle, letting half a billion people's personal info cross borders freely Exploring the digital future Annika Haas (EU2017EE) \nBREXIT is having many unexpected consequences.

Pau Barrena/Bloomberg via Getty Images By Chris Baraniuk \nTHERE\u2019S a new way to prove you are who you say you are \u2013 inspired by the tech underpinning bitcoin. Usually, when you need to verify your identity, the process is archaic, insecure and time-consuming. You get a copy of your birth certificate in the post, put it in an envelope and hope it gets to whoever is asking for it. In the digital era, this should take seconds. \nBut putting something as sensitive as a birth certificate online risks identity theft in the era of hacks and leaks. Now, the US state of Illinois is experimenting with a secure way of putting control of that data into its citizens\u2019 hands, with the help of distributed ledgers, similar to the blockchain used by bitcoin. \nJust last month, Illinois announced a pilot project to create \u201csecure \u2018self-sovereign\u2019 identity\u201d for Illinois citizens wishing to access their birth certificate. The idea is to use a blockchain-like distributed ledger that allows online access only to the people owning the ID, and any third parties granted their permission. Advertisement \nIllinois is working with software firm Evernym of Herriman, Utah, to create a record of who should be able to access data from the state\u2019s birth register. Once this is done, no central authority should be required , just your say-so. \nThey\u2019re not the only ones. According to a report by Garrick Hileman and Michael Rauchs at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, UK, governments are increasingly experimenting with it, including the UK and Brazil. \nActivists have long called for people to have greater control of their data . Hacks and leaks are making it too risky for authorities to be the central repository of citizens\u2019 most vital information. \nWith distributed ledgers, all participants within a network can have their own identical copy of data like access permissions \u2013 so no one can view cryptographically sealed birth certificate data unless they\u2019re meant to. Blockchains are a type of distributed ledger that gets the whole network to observe and verify transactions \u2013 such as when someone sends a bitcoin to their friend. \nDistributed ledgers could be a great way to store critical data. But \u201cthe devil is always in the details\u201d, says Dave Birch at electronic transactions consultancy Consult Hyperion. Done wrong, distributed ledgers could carve mistakes in stone. \n\u201cIf your midwife fat-fingers the weight of the child or the name then you\u2019re going to have a typo in your name from birth forever,\u201d says privacy analyst Steve Wilson of Constellation Research. \u201cBullshit in, bullshit forever.\u201d \nNonetheless, some think these projects are a step towards a world where all data is managed by the individuals who own it. It could backfire on governments, though. Citizens in Catalonia are gearing up for a referendum on independence from Spain, planned for 1 October. It has been termed \u201cillegal\u201d by authorities in Madrid. But a start-up is studying the possibility of using blockchain technology to let citizens hold their own vote, with no government authority needed. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cTime to digitally prove who you are\u201d Article amended on 28 September 2017 \nCorrection: Steve Wilson\u2019s quote has now been correctly attributed to him. \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris baraniuk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael rauchs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave birch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrick hileman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "evernym of herriman", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:18:55.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "47d07ebb010885920fd8b7de023485d9318b4692", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLav_2rVRDAYj8qBVtOvl6HW4x8WCpZAamd86WVim1KrdhnGhl1yhq_Fab8fiZS1pZwdBuTDBlnw_Ip3A4KR0V8apd8dF.535G2Q--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Common antidepressant found to reduce belly fat in older mice", "title_full": "Common antidepressant found to reduce belly fat in older mice", "published": "2017-09-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27171216/gettyimages-137864680.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1161, "comments": 0, "shares": 1161}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 26}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "47d07ebb010885920fd8b7de023485d9318b4692", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLav_2rVRDAYj8qBVtOvl6HW4x8WCpZAamd86WVim1KrdhnGhl1yhq_Fab8fiZS1pZwdBuTDBlnw_Ip3A4KR0V8apd8dF.535G2Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Common antidepressant found to reduce belly fat in older mice", "text": "Common antidepressant found to reduce belly fat in older mice Can\u2019t shake that gut anymore CamiloTorres/Getty By Amanda Onion \nBelly fat can be deadly , and is linked to a host of chronic diseases, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes. But as many of us probably know, it can be hard to lose weight in this area. Now it seems that inflammation of immune cells may be to blame, and we may be able to use drugs to help us burn off our belly flab. \nChristina Cammel , of the Yale School of Medicine, and her colleagues have been investigating macrophages \u2013 immune cells that normally track down and gobble up pathogens in the body. But as we age, there\u2019s evidence that the macrophages in belly fat become inflamed. \nTo see what effect this might have, Cammel\u2019s team isolated macrophages from the fat tissue of young and old mice, and sequenced the DNA from these cells. They found that the genomes of the aged macrophages expressed more genes that hinder a group of molecules that spread signals between nerve cells, called catecholamines. Advertisement \nThe genes do this by activating an enzyme that suppresses these neurotransmitters. The boosted activity of this enzyme in aged immune cells in the belly fat of older mice effectively block signals telling the body that there is fat there that is available to burn for energy. \n\u201cWe found [that] macrophages in belly fat interfere with signals in a way that\u2019s new to us,\u201d says Cammel. \nAntidepressant effect \nWhen the action of a receptor that is involved in the inflammation of immune cells was dampened-down, they found that neurotransmitter signals returned to normal and older mice were able to burn belly fat as rapidly as younger mice after a 24-hour fasting period. \nA drug was then used to mess with the enzyme, lots of which was found in aged immune cells. Blocking this enzyme had a similar effect, and older mice were able to burn off the fat around their middle again. \nThe drug used is a common antidepressant called clorgyline, which is given to some people because low levels of catecholamine have been linked to symptoms of depression. \nBut we don\u2019t know yet if people taking this drug get any positive side effects on their waistlines. It may be tricky to find out, says Cammel, because the drug also causes changes in appetite. How it does this is unclear \u2013 there\u2019s evidence of the drug both boosting and decreasing appetite in people. \nIn any case, the findings are promising. They have shown that it\u2019s possible to manipulate inflammation and fat metabolism in laboratory animals, says Matt Kaeberlein , at the University of Washington, in Seattle. \u201cThere\u2019s no biological reason to think this will be more difficult in humans.\u201d \nJournal reference: Nature , DOI: 10.1038/nature24022", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt kaeberlein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christina cammel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cammel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yale school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of washington", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T21:18:57.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c879ce535116901da3c8271c938647772296cedd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaqoeWTQbD9Okg_yDJCUxQZXdv.2F2784s3LRC61LYDAKjeb1MCM_eaQ1b6rWEc5lAuVRc35EwRiuCNvvXw5SYR7qo58DnIC0uA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/love-sex", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Lab-grown cells make doping agent EPO and cure anaemia in mice", "title_full": "Lab-grown cells make doping agent EPO and cure anaemia in mice", "published": "2017-09-27T22:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27160921/c0320742-red_blood_cells_in_isotonic_solution_sem-spl.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 252, "comments": 0, "shares": 252}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 9}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c879ce535116901da3c8271c938647772296cedd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaqoeWTQbD9Okg_yDJCUxQZXdv.2F2784s3LRC61LYDAKjeb1MCM_eaQ1b6rWEc5lAuVRc35EwRiuCNvvXw5SYR7qo58DnIC0uA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T22:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lab-grown cells make doping agent EPO and cure anaemia in mice", "text": "Lab-grown cells make doping agent EPO and cure anaemia in mice Need more of these? DENNIS KUNKEL MICROSCOPY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY By Andy Coghlan \nTransplants grown from stem cells in the lab can help replenish the blood and have been used to cure anaemia in mice. The discovery could lead to treatments for people with anaemia caused by kidney disease. \nIn the US, 30 million people have chronic kidney disease . Because the kidney makes erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that triggers the production of red blood cells, people whose kidneys degenerate can develop anaemia \u2013 not having enough red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body. \nEPO, which has notoriously been used as a doping agent in competitive sports, can be produced commercially and used as an anaemia treatment, but it is expensive. Such treatment requires a person to undergo at least three infusions of EPO a week, which is impractical for many, and the treatment can sometimes cause heart problems. \nNow researchers have made cells that produce EPO instead, and used them to treat mice. The team did this using stem cells from human cord blood, inducing them to become pluripotent stem cells capable of becoming any type of cell. By treating these with various growth factors, they were able to coax them into becoming cells that make EPO. Smart cells \nThe team then transplanted these cells into the kidney cavities of mice with a form of kidney anaemia. Within four weeks, EPO levels in the blood of treated animals were 20-fold higher than in controls. \n\u201cJust one transplant of the human EPO-producing cells treated kidney anaemia in mice, keeping their haemoglobin levels in the normal range for the remaining 7-month lifespan of the animals,\u201d says Kenji Osafune , of Kyoto University in Japan, who led the team. \n\u201cThis is a very clever strategy that exploits \u2018smart cells\u2019 as factories for therapeutic proteins,\u201d says George Daley of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cCells have the capacity to regulate protein production to suit demand, and offer considerable advantages over periodic injections of therapeutic proteins,\u201d he said.

A tiny transforming robot can put on special exoskeleton outfits tailor-made to help it complete different activities, including walking, rolling, sailing and gliding. This could one day be used as a blueprint for mini robotic surgeons or explorers. \nEach exoskeleton starts out as a sheet of plastic onto which the robot, known as Primer, rolls. Heat is then applied to cause the exoskeleton to fold around the robot in a motion akin to a piece of origami assembling itself. The folds are created by lines cut into the sheet of plastic, with their depths responsible for the angle of fold. \nThe exoskeletons allow the robot to adapt to different situations. One gives it the ability to roll, meaning it can move twice as fast as without the exoskeleton; another is shaped like a boat, letting it float on water and carry nearly twice its weight. It even has a glider-shaped exoskeleton that allows it to soar when falling from a height. Advertisement \nvia GIPHY . Credit: MIT/CSAIL \nPrimer itself is only a couple of centimetres in size and is controlled by an external magnetic field. Once it has finished with a particular exoskeleton, it can ditch the covering by dipping itself in water. Mini surgeons and explorers \n\u201cIn the future, we imagine robots like this could become mini surgeons, squished into a pill that you swallow ,\u201d says Daniela Rus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \nOnce in the stomach, the tiny surgeons could use different exoskeletons to cut tissue samples or deliver medicine \u2013 applications that are still a long way off, but could have many advantages. \u201cSome aspects of surgery could be done without incisions, pain, or infection,\u201d says Rus. \nThe robots could also be used for exploration tasks, or monitoring abandoned warehouses, says Jamie Paik at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. \u201cThis is a great example of how origami robots can take on diverse tasks using different clothing, meaning that you can mould the robot to different situations,\u201d she says. \nJournal reference: Science Robotics , DOI: 10.1126/scirobotics.aao4369 \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jason dorfman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jamie paik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timothy revell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniela rus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "massachusetts institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swiss federal institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lausanne", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T22:18:02.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3164195be1f997209cb8e49de5313b1983e8594", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaon.9HyGGN171z9NRTe.bg.3DeVeducc8AlHvIdqp1AammfNi9YIAd0fT7ax0NO3Czyj7xaypQvaTWnFzRWfSO0-", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/endangered-species", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Snap decisions: Thomas Ruff\u2019s show is, literally, off colour", "title_full": "Snap decisions: Thomas Ruff\u2019s show is, literally, off colour", "published": "2017-09-28T12:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28103810/aperture_ruff.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 87, "comments": 0, "shares": 87}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3164195be1f997209cb8e49de5313b1983e8594", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaon.9HyGGN171z9NRTe.bg.3DeVeducc8AlHvIdqp1AammfNi9YIAd0fT7ax0NO3Czyj7xaypQvaTWnFzRWfSO0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-28T12:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Snap decisions: Thomas Ruff\u2019s show is, literally, off colour", "text": "28 September 2017 Snap decisions: Thomas Ruff\u2019s show is, literally, off colour A photographer once known for reimagining portraiture now gives astronomy a disconcerting makeover at London\u2019s Whitechapel Gallery By Sumit Paul-Choudhury \n\u201cPhotography is a kind of prosthesis for humans,\u201d says Thomas Ruff. A craft that began with nothing more than a lens and a photosensitive plate has turned into an art that involves a vast array of image-capturing devices that allow us to see far beyond the limitations of our own eyes. \nFew have made more comprehensive creative use of these devices than Ruff, whose works have anticipated and riffed off key developments in photography over the past 40 years, from ubiquitous surveillance to face-swapping apps. In the 1980s, for example, he blew passport-style headshots up to colossal proportions that shockingly revealed every detail of his sitters\u2019 features \u2013 detail that can now be captured by anyone with a high-resolution smartphone camera. Extreme close-up Woman Portrait, Portr\u00e4t (P Stadtb\u00e4umer), 1988, C-print 210\u00d7165cm \u00a9 Thomas Ruff \nBut it was those portraits that soured Ruff on conventional photography: he disliked the sense that he had staged the images to be \u201cthe view into Big Brother\u2019s camera\u201d, as he says at the opening of a retrospective of his works at London\u2019s Whitechapel Gallery. So for his next project, Sterne , he set out to take \u201cthe most objective photograph possible\u201d, procuring deep-field images of the night sky from the European Southern Observatory. Ruff, who says he struggled to choose between studying astronomy and art, cropped those images and created monochrome compositions that loom over the viewer with a kind of chilly grandeur. Advertisement \nThe realisation that he lacked the equipment or skills to take such pictures himself liberated Ruff to make use of other archive and found images, ranging from internet porn to decontextualised newswire pictures. His reworks invite the viewer to reflect on the production and uses of such images, often taken for granted. Nonetheless, an artist reconfiguring astronomical images might raise hackles: aren\u2019t they self-evidently beautiful already? The most-objective photograph possible?

The HiRISE team haven\u2019t been bashful about promoting the beauty of their images themselves, turning them into a popular Twitter stream and a coffee-table book. But for Ruff, \u201ccolour in space doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s nonsense\u201d. The colours in the official HiRISE images don\u2019t represent what human eyes would see; introducing colour to space-probe imagery has become a rather competitive hobby for online enthusiasts.

Is it safe, and will it work? Stephen Webster/Plainpicture By Sally Adee \nI DISCOVER the French bistro tucked into a strip mall that wraps around a parking lot it shares with a hardware shop and a barber. The man I am meeting has asked to come here instead of the clinic because he doesn\u2019t want to do an interview while being transfused. \nI am led to a booth where I find him drinking a glass of wine, wearing the blazer-and-T-shirt uniform common among venture capitalists. His youthful looks have an enhanced, slightly uncanny cast, but I am still shocked when he tells me he is 65. To protect his privacy, he chooses to be identified for this article as JR. \nJR is a minor celebrity in these parts. It is the fifth time this year that he has flown in from Atlanta to have the treatment. Monterey doesn\u2019t get a lot of traffic from people like him. \nYou might think of the Californian coast as a homogeneous stretch of sun-drenched sand and rich people. But things change around the middle of the state. Driving there from San Francisco, you quickly lose the sun behind a permanent blanket of fog. The central coast is long and flat, with glimpses of iron grey choppy waves behind squat buildings. \nSo it\u2019s a bit odd that this is the epicentre of a phenomenon rocking Silicon Valley: young blood treatments. JR is one of about 100 people who have each paid $8000 to join a controversial trial, offering them infusions of blood plasma from donors aged between 16 and 25 in a bid to turn back the clock.

Advertisement \nHaving a view of its surroundings is the first step. Using laser scanners and a technique called SLAM, which calculates the distance between the drone and nearby objects, it will build up a map of its environment. And it can do so quickly. \nThe company recently used its manually operated drone, TILT Ranger, to map an underground mine in Mali using SLAM. In just 10 minutes, they were able to virtually reconstruct a section of the mine with a volume of roughly 30,000 cubic metres \u2013 about a third the size of London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big challenge to capture such zones quickly,\u201d says AlNomany. Building a picture \nNow the firm\u2019s new autonomous drone can combine its map with additional input from sensors, such as an accelerometer, to position the drone and move without GPS. So far, during preliminary tests, it has been able to stabilise itself on its own in the air. \nWhen it encounters unusually shaped space, it has a backup. Equipped with wheels, the drone can move along the ground and tilt to fly or roll at an angle if needed. \u201cIf it is near a wall, the drone will adapt to it and climb it instead of flying,\u201d says AlNomany. \nAdriano Mazzini at the University of Oslo in Norway thinks that automated drones are now the ideal choice to explore dangerous environments. \u201cRelatively lightweight and high-performing tools can now be added to them,\u201d he says. He recently sent a drone over the erupting Lusi mud volcano in Java, Indonesia, to sample gas, water and mud \u2013 something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. \nInkonova\u2019s drones are of interest for other GPS-deprived environments too. The company was recently contacted to map a decommissioned nuclear plant. However, the mission was aborted through concern that the drone\u2019s propellers would disperse potentially radioactive dust inside. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pursue it further, but we would like to adapt Tilt Ranger for this purpose,\u201d says AlNomany. \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sandrin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "adriano mazzini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmed alnomany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lusi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inkonova", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of oslo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inkonova", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal albert hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-28T15:55:59.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1f2519b2e551dbab00e1d89d30f2149bd67fa01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXoz_K8m99zx3l4bSEFrlinAuvzMLZG66rerEmT3b4mlE.SOapwDMMJR2Wj3qTa8r1lAVoYB7Tftx2ccusM_fQQMB7lYPoERZk_AddDsV_4xYU", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "", "title": "EU plan to erase digital borders will further isolate Brexit UK", "title_full": "EU plan to erase digital borders will further isolate Brexit UK", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.967, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27180000/36530595573_e5be2b64d0_o.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 148, "comments": 0, "shares": 148}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1f2519b2e551dbab00e1d89d30f2149bd67fa01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXoz_K8m99zx3l4bSEFrlinAuvzMLZG66rerEmT3b4mlE.SOapwDMMJR2Wj3qTa8r1lAVoYB7Tftx2ccusM_fQQMB7lYPoERZk_AddDsV_4xYU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "EU plan to erase digital borders will further isolate Brexit UK", "text": "5 EU plan to erase digital borders will further isolate Brexit UK \nEstonia wants the European Union to adopt free movement of data as a fundamental principle, letting half a billion people's personal info cross borders freely ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "brexit uk", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": [{"name": "brexit uk  estonia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-28T17:29:03.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7fad685ed0f88aa87b517c28b58a96a58b18d5e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLai6iobQ1BI0cFgWxDkDucClNSL0ezcVdrmc1OwAYlbmfZac.hzOS34k4DvuIOM9PMnPqsHUsHp3FwJ17KMDs6hlstM_pbz4Ihw--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/senses", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist -

But breads, cakes and pastas made from these strains might also appeal to people with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, and those who think gluten-free diets are healthier. \nA small trial in 20 people with \u201cgluten sensitivity\u201d has shown that they can tolerate bread made with this special wheat, says Francisco Barro, at the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture in Cordoba, who is creating the new strains. However, the results from this tiny trial have not been published yet. \nWhat\u2019s more, Barro acknowledges that the idea that some people cannot tolerate gluten is controversial. While a few people do seem to have digestive problems when they eat some foods made from normal wheat, some studies suggest gluten is not the cause . Instead, certain kinds of sugars found in a wide range of foods might be the problem.

An analysis of more than 20 years of labour automation in Germany found no evidence that robots caused job losses in the country as a whole. \nAutomation has changed the kinds of work people do, but hasn\u2019t taken jobs away permanently, says Jens S\u00fcdekum at Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf. Although there are plenty of reports that predict future job losses caused by automation, S\u00fcdekum\u2019s study is only the second to look at how many jobs robots have already taken from us. \nThe first \u2013 a US study published earlier this year \u2013 painted a much gloomier picture. Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University found that workplace automation squeezes wages and takes away between three and six jobs per robot. Advertisement \nGiven that Germany has about eight robots for every thousand workers \u2013 four times as many as in the US \u2013 S\u00fcdekum and his colleagues expected to see more job losses there. \u201cOur initial impulse was that it should be much worse in Germany,\u201d he says. So their finding that the country\u2019s workforces have actually faced less of an impact from the worst effects of automation was a surprise. \nOne reason for this is that while robots have stopped companies creating new jobs in manufacturing \u2013 S\u00fcdekum estimates that 275,000 fewer jobs were created between 1994 and 2014 because of automation \u2013 this has been offset by new posts created in other sectors, particularly the service industry. \nPeople that already worked in industries prone to automation, such as the automotive industry, were also more likely to stay employed after robots were introduced into their workplaces. \u201cWe don\u2019t see people getting fired,\u201d says S\u00fcdekum. \nIt\u2019s not all good news, however. Robots have tended to lead to lower wages in lower and medium-skilled manufacturing jobs, the study found . \u201cSome of the workers do have to swallow wage cuts because of robots,\u201d says S\u00fcdekum. But for more highly skilled workers and those outside manufacturing, robots had no impact on wages. Shielding the impact \nGermany\u2019s unions might be to thank for reducing the impact of automation on jobs, says S\u00fcdekum, explaining that they are generally more willing to accept wage cuts for workers if it means people keep their jobs. \nBut Manuel Cebrian at Massachusetts Institute of Technology says that might not be enough to keep people in work in the long run. \u201cWe know the only way to ameliorate the problem is through continuing education,\u201d he says. Cebrian co-authored a study that found smaller cities \u2013 which tend to have higher proportions of low-skilled workers \u2013 will be hit by automation much harder than big ones. \n\u201cThe major cities are disproportionately attracting the types of jobs that are more resilient to automation,\u201d he says. But he thinks it\u2019s still too early to know whether enough of those jobs are being created to make up for losses in other industries. \nAnother option, S\u00fcdekum says, would be to make sure that the benefits of automation \u2013 which saves manufacturers money that would otherwise be spent on wages \u2013 are shared with all workers. Earlier this week, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the UK\u2019s Labour party , joined Bill Gates in calling for higher taxes on companies that replace human workers with robots . \nBut S\u00fcdekum thinks that talk of robots stealing all of jobs is a touch hyperbolic. If the automotive industry is anything to go by, we\u2019re more likely to see a gradual shift in the kinds of jobs that people move into rather than permanent losses, he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe the horror stories.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cebrian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s\u00fcdekum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jens s\u00fcdekum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manuel cebrian", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "massachusetts institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heinrich heine university d\u00fcsseldorf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts institute of technology and boston university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "germany workplace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-28T19:15:12.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "628d24148ed4af72996e730f575ef2ec534798d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLavBFoffzQJq8EtkXzUHBkeat7AxDAzLsvyFxrPo6PDnyhTwC9F9lcq7fu73aWZY1Wp641foHv331YRLR2FZCncU-", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Ancient \u2018sea woodlice\u2019 had surprisingly complicated guts", "title_full": "Ancient \u2018sea woodlice\u2019 had surprisingly complicated guts", "published": "2017-09-28T20:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28173323/journal.pone_.0184982.g001.png", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 418, "comments": 0, "shares": 418}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "628d24148ed4af72996e730f575ef2ec534798d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLavBFoffzQJq8EtkXzUHBkeat7AxDAzLsvyFxrPo6PDnyhTwC9F9lcq7fu73aWZY1Wp641foHv331YRLR2FZCncU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-28T20:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ancient \u2018sea woodlice\u2019 had surprisingly complicated guts", "text": "Ancient \u2018sea woodlice\u2019 had surprisingly complicated guts Melanie J. Hopkins, Feiyang Chen, Shixue Hu, Zhifei Zhang By Colin Barras \nA rare glimpse inside a 510-million-year-old digestive system suggests feeding was a complicated business for the first arthropods. Even this early in animal evolution, some animals had a variety of structures in their gut for storing and processing food. \nArthropods fared especially well following the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago , particularly the now-extinct trilobites , which occupied the oceans for about 270 million years. Advertisement \nAbout 20,000 species of trilobite are known, but only about 40 species preserve any traces of their digestive system. \nMelanie Hopkins at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, and Zhifei Zhang at Northwest University in Xi\u2019an, China and colleagues have now added two trilobites to this short list. Gutsy trilobites \nPalaeolenus lantenoisi and Redlichia mansuyi lived between 509 and 514 million years ago, and are preserved in the rocks of eastern Yunnan, China. Both are fairly early trilobites, so they should have had simple guts, but no. \nBoth show evidence of an expanded stomach or \u201ccrop\u201d beneath the head shield. This was probably used to store food early in digestion, says Hopkins. It has never been seen in such ancient trilobites. \nP. lantenoisi also had a series of paired digestive glands \u2013 perhaps for further breakdown of food \u2013 running along its alimentary tract. \nIt\u2019s a combination of features that is virtually unheard-of in trilobites. Many researchers had assumed trilobites either had a crop or digestive glands, but never both. \n\u201cI think it is possible that many trilobites had both,\u201d says Hopkins. If a specimen seems to lack one, that might simply be due to poor preservation. Mystery diet \n\u201cThere was more variation in digestive system anatomy than previously thought,\u201d says Allison Daley at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. \u201cThese new findings suggest a great variation in how trilobites processed their food, even as geologically early as in the Cambrian.\u201d \nThis mirrors the complex feeding behaviours seen in other early animals like the enigmatic anomalocaridids , which looked like a cross between squid and huge woodlice. Seemingly, some targeted specific prey while others were filter feeders . \nIt would help to know what trilobites ate, but this is \u201ccontroversial\u201d, says Daley. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult to pinpoint exactly what they ate and how.\u201d \nA January 2017 study pointed out that paired digestive glands like those of P. lantenoisi are often found in predatory arthropods today, suggesting trilobites were active predators. But other researchers argue that the trilobite glands seem far simpler than those seen today , so this argument may not hold. \nIt would be better to infer what they ate from their mouthparts and limbs, says Thomas Hegna at Western Illinois University in Macomb.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-28T21:14:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a76ed566296139f80ae8fa68a4ededdc8eb7d4cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLapAAaEiaOUuC4SWHV9Vh4yJGr6LFP7WWWUEPGe4LeeeTWyTdKcCDY4A-", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "What is really missing from AI?", "title_full": "What is really missing from AI?", "published": "2017-09-28T20:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28174739/teasermainarselectronica.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 118, "comments": 0, "shares": 118}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a76ed566296139f80ae8fa68a4ededdc8eb7d4cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLapAAaEiaOUuC4SWHV9Vh4yJGr6LFP7WWWUEPGe4LeeeTWyTdKcCDY4A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-28T20:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is really missing from AI?", "text": "28 September 2017 What is really missing from AI? A festival\u2019s search for humanity in AI points to the absence of love \u2013 and something even more fundamental Disenchantment Space by Atsushi Tadokoro at the Ars Electronica festival Florian Voggeneder By Gabriel Adheri \nA bedridden person lies immobile on a stark white bed. As the camera pans to an almost-lifeless arm, a robot intones with as much care as a clipped, monorhythmic voice can muster: \u201cI am sorry that your family and friends are not able to be here with you. I will do my best to comfort you.\u201d \nThis is End of Life Care Machine by artist Dan Chen, an interactive installation designed to give visitors a peek at what it might be like as the arms of a robot caress you into your final slumber. As the vital signs tail off barely minutes after meeting, the nameless Charon\u2019s parting words to the dying human are chillier because of their artificial warmth: \u201cGoodbye, my friend\u201d. \nThe work is part of this year\u2019s Ars Electronica festival in Linz, Austria, with its subtitle Artificial Life: The other I plugging into the present obsession with AI. Advertisement \nThe documentation for Chen\u2019s installation sits uncomfortably amid remote-controlled dildos and sassy sex robots in the Artificial Intimacy section of the festival\u2019s labyrinthine Post City location \u2013 one of 12 sites hosting this far-flung show. Amid these cruder interpretations of, or tools for, artificial intimacy, Chen\u2019s work touches on the theme that runs through the smorgasbord of digital exhibits: the search for our own humanity. End of Life Care Machine by Dan Chen Florian Voggeneder \nSurprisingly, alongside the almost obligatory dancing robots and automated sound installations, are tender artworks exploring that most fundamental of emotions \u2013 love. Whereas Chen\u2019s work shows us, by its absence, the love that soothes when shuffling off this mortal coil, the Kissenger allows you to kiss anyone you video-call, realistically, via a piece of sensitive oval rubber. This comes complete with pressure sensors and actuators, placed where the mouth would be on both phones. Robotic love \nThe Homo Digitalis experiment from Christiane Miethge and Nils Otte, on the other hand, takes us through the journey of a female protagonist into a more digital being. One part of her journey involves exploring a relationship with a female sex robot. Captured in a short film, there are hints that the robotic nature of the exploration may be an easier route for our protagonist than if she were encountering a real-life woman in the same way. \nWhy? The answer may lie in some of the festival\u2019s other installations. In a darkened room, red-lit piles of what looks like rubbish squeak, inviting inspection. Getting closer, the ill-defined shapes jerk into Wall-E -style life. These robots of Rekion Voice , a work by Katsuki Nogami and Taiki Watai, are slaves to human action, mimicking the excitement of whoever triggers them. Perched atop shopping trolleys and air-conditioning units, the cuteness of the robots\u2019 movements is underscored by their dystopian conditions. Rekion Voice by Katsuki Nogami and Taiki Watai Tom Mesic \nIt\u2019s the positioning of this work with one a few doors down that really brings the point home. Along the corridor is a white room in which stark lighting illuminates a plinth crowned by a dog-fur outfit, including a hood made of the skinned, eyeless face of a nameless hound. \nThis macabre work \u2013 cumbersomely titled Canine TANATOcommerce or the Political-ethical Dilemma of Merchandise / The Bio-unlawfulness of Being: Stray dogs \u2013 was fashioned by artist Berenice Olmedo Pe\u00f1a from the corpses of stray dogs killed on the roads of Mexico. \nPe\u00f1a\u2019s art turns our most familiar companion species into a commodity, thereby shining a light on our responsibility for domesticating a species only to abandon and abuse individuals. But more than this, she questions our humanity in the treatment of any \u201cother\u201d over which we have responsibility \u2013 be that a dog, a robot slave, or Homo Digitalis \u2018s sex robot. Multisensory experience \nThis bleak face of humanity is offset by Maja Smrekar\u2019s K-9_topology project, which won Ars Electronica\u2019s Golden Nica award for hybrid art. This thoughtful, multisensory work comes from Smrekar\u2019s lifelong relationship with dogs. She uses the tools of biotechnology to explore the chemical and biological aspects of the emotional connection between herself and her canine companions. \nAlongside much of the scientific paraphernalia, a huge, fur-lined horn opens at head height. The recycled wolf fur she uses hides a respirator that exudes perfumed serotonin extracted from both artist and dog \u2013 a chemical expression of their shared pleasure in each other, the product of thousands of years of co-evolution. K-9_topology by Maja Smrekar Tom Mesic \nTreading the thin line between bleak and cute, Japanese musician Etsuko Yakushimaru\u2019s I\u2019m Humanity explores our ongoing efforts to use DNA as a data storage method . This is a double-edged work: there is a possibility that the host bacteria may be able to \u201cevolve\u201d and change Yakushimaru\u2019s bewitchingly catchy J-pop work, but at the same time there is a darker undertone about using living things for our own ends. \nAnother hot topic \u2013 particularly after this year\u2019s raised awareness of the rise of \u201cfake\u201d \u2013 is directly addressed by one of the festival\u2019s academic AI projects. Synthesizing Obama: Learning lip sync from audio by Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Steven Seitz and Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman relies on neural networks to create video of the former US president to match audio of his speeches. \nOther installations focus on machine learning for image matching. Many act as expos\u00e9s of the tools, but Closed Loop by Jake Elwes pushes this further. Elwes creates a conversation between a text-only and image-only AI, constantly iterating over interpretations of each other but never quite hitting the mark. \nHis work is as effective at shining a light on what\u2019s missing in AI as Chen\u2019s artificial carer. \nAnd so, thanks to Ars Electronica, perhaps we can finally see that what\u2019s missing from Artificial Life: The other I is ourselves. \nArs Electronica 2017 ran in Linz, Austria, from 7-11 September \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pe\u00f1a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yakushimaru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elwes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan chen florian voggeneder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiki watai tom mesic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christiane miethge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nils otte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ars electronica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriel adheri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smrekar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homo digitalis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan chen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ira kemelmacher-shlizerman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiki watai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven seitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etsuko yakushimaru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supasorn suwajanakorn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atsushi tadokoro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maja smrekar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katsuki nogami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berenice olmedo pe\u00f1a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kissenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jake elwes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maja smrekar tom mesic", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rekion voice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homo digitalis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ars electronica", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-28T21:14:31.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51c2260851f8d6b585166d04f922dbb0d1e61c03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaqxj9oxw_LTsnUzrg5fG7fP5azNaqFUaaSrZjTYc_nxw.P_QMxgg.N8f2d7SkX90gnTH18LDRgKt4fjltFMfNRxO_mQ5v_VYNA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Google quantum computer test shows breakthrough is within reach", "title_full": "Google quantum computer test shows breakthrough is within reach", "published": "2017-09-28T21:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28182131/linear9xmonsurfacecode.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 964, "comments": 0, "shares": 964}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 203}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51c2260851f8d6b585166d04f922dbb0d1e61c03", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaqxj9oxw_LTsnUzrg5fG7fP5azNaqFUaaSrZjTYc_nxw.P_QMxgg.N8f2d7SkX90gnTH18LDRgKt4fjltFMfNRxO_mQ5v_VYNA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-28T21:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google quantum computer test shows breakthrough is within reach", "text": "Google quantum computer test shows breakthrough is within reach Nine quantum qubit coins ready to flip Julian Kelly By Mark Kim \nGoogle has big plans for quantum computing. The company has come up with a strategy for demonstrating quantum supremacy, the claim that quantum computers can perform tasks that no current computers can. While it\u2019s widely assumed that we will eventually reach quantum supremacy, nobody has done it yet because current quantum computers can only run a small number of specialised algorithms. \nTheir plan is based on simulating coin flips. An ordinary computer does this by storing two numbers and choosing one of them at random each time. To simulate 50 coin tosses, it just selects 50 times in a row. \nThis is simple with regular coins, but if the coins behave like particles obeying the laws of quantum mechanics, things get more complicated. Advertisement \nIn that case, we cannot know whether any individual coin turned up heads or tails without knowing about all the other coins, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. The problem of simulating coin tosses with quantum entanglement is called quantum sampling. \nComputers work sequentially, so choosing 50 numbers at the same time is not something they can do. For this reason, the Google group argues, quantum sampling would require storing all possible configurations of all 50 coin tosses, so that all of the coins can be thrown simultaneously. \nSince one bit \u2013 the building block of classical computers \u2013 can only store one of two states, heads or tails, covering all possible configurations for 50 coins takes hundreds of terabytes of data storage. Qubit coins \nThis is where quantum computers come in. They\u2019re based on qubits , which can be in two states at the same time. This makes it possible to store the probability distribution of all the configurations at once using a single qubit for each coin. For this reason, the Google group argues, quantum sampling would be easy for a quantum computer. \nIn their proposal, the team demonstrates quantum sampling up to nine coins with high accuracy using their 9-qubit quantum computer. \u201cIf similar error rates are achievable in future devices with around 50 qubits, we will be able to explore quantum dynamics that are inaccessible otherwise,\u201d the proposal states. This way, quantum computers of the near future can be used to study physics, a huge step-up from their infancy when they couldn\u2019t do anything practical. \nThe only remaining task, then, is to build a 50-qubit computer . And the team just might, given their track record \n\u201cThey\u2019ve been delivering many of the expectations,\u201d says Scott Aaronson at the University of Texas in Austin. \u201cThe truth is, the Google group has such a strong record that if they say they\u2019re going to do it, people pay attention.\u201d \nIndeed, the Google group has completed the necessary preparatory work to build large-scale quantum computers, according to Jacob Taylor of University of Maryland. \u201cThey\u2019ve demonstrated that the obvious pitfalls are largely accounted for,\u201d he says. Pick your problem \nNot everyone is convinced quantum sampling is the right problem to tackle in order to demonstrate quantum supremacy, though. \n\u201cIt is unclear whether what they claim to show is quantum supremacy,\u201d says Itay Hen of the University of Southern California. \u201cYou have to prove that classical computers can\u2019t do it.\u201d \nHe says that many important quantum-mechanical systems can be simulated on present-day computers, because it\u2019s not necessary to save all of the information about the system to simulate it. \nProof that this kind of simulation can\u2019t be done on a classical computer may not come anytime soon, but many concepts in this field are accepted as true without formal proof .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-28T21:27:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1088c2cbe88db6940d4bf6ef82aae84a73dd4aa6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaoi1SEHbRzz2gkTcFjblV.G56kofVKIpKNgm185uuKO8ao_M.pYg.m102JM53G5hhhfpw0T.LrwXNwg63FDgr7hPu8fyrZ0N4w--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/lastword", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Hundreds of Japanese species floated to the US on tsunami debris", "title_full": "Hundreds of Japanese species floated to the US on tsunami debris", "published": "2017-09-28T22:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28180030/lead_7349300004_14f075aca1_o.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 30, "comments": 0, "shares": 30}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1088c2cbe88db6940d4bf6ef82aae84a73dd4aa6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaoi1SEHbRzz2gkTcFjblV.G56kofVKIpKNgm185uuKO8ao_M.pYg.m102JM53G5hhhfpw0T.LrwXNwg63FDgr7hPu8fyrZ0N4w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-28T22:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hundreds of Japanese species floated to the US on tsunami debris", "text": "Hundreds of Japanese species floated to the US on tsunami debris From distant waters Hatfield Marine Science Center Oregon State University By Andy Coghlan \nHundreds of marine animals have made an epic 7000-kilometre trip across the Pacific Ocean from Japan to the US. They simply hitched rides on the myriad boats and debris swept up by the massive Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011 . \nA marine wildlife census under way since 2012 has now documented 289 species arriving this way, including fish, mussels, barnacles, sea slugs, anemones, sea stars, crabs, clams and sponges \u2013 all native to Japanese waters. \nSome fish survived for years in water-filled troughs on fishing boats, which somehow avoided overturning. They include banded knifejaws and yellowtail amberjacks , some of them up to 60 centimetres long. Advertisement \n\u201cThey had just enough food to keep going, but they were pretty emaciated on arrival,\u201d says James Carlton of Williams College in Massachusetts, who set up the census. Since he knew when the tsunami happened, he could tell how long the debris stayed at sea, which stowaways thrived, and how long it took them to reach the US. \nMany of the stowaways were adrift for years, clinging to upturned boats, tsunami buoys and other flotsam. \n\u201cThe largest were two large, floating fishing docks, both as long as tennis courts and half the width,\u201d says Carlton. \u201cThe first dock arrived in Oregon in June 2012 and had 100 species on it.\u201d That came from the Japanese port of Misawa, followed by another which reached Washington state in December that year. Two identical docks from Misawa remain missing. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest rafting event ever aboard anthropogenic material, and the first time we\u2019ve been able to track material on this scale,\u201d says Carlton. \nArrivals are starting to tail off, but Carlton says the invasion is not over. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the spring 2018 pulse to see what comes in.\u201d What we know of is probably a fraction of what actually arrived, as much debris was cleared without analysis before the census began. \nThe sheer number of species surviving arduous trans-Pacific journeys is impressive. But the census also shows how potentially invasive species can travel further and for longer than before, because human-made materials \u2013 like fibreglass, used in many fishing boats \u2013 last longer than natural ones like wood or rafts formed from landslide material . Hatfield Marine Science Center Oregon State University \nIf climate change increases the number or strength of storms and typhoons that lash built-up coastlines, ever more species will be swept around the world, Carlton says. The current spate of hurricanes probably carried more debris out to sea, he adds. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s of most concern is that growth in coastal infrastructure, ongoing plastic pollution , rising sea levels and extreme events make situations like the one documented more likely,\u201d says Steven Chown of Monash University in Australia. \nNone of the Japanese species has yet become established or invasive in the US. \u201cBut after they arrive, it can take several years before we can detect them, so until they grow to a detectable point, we don\u2019t know how many will settle,\u201d says Carlton. \u201cIt\u2019s like ecological roulette.\u201d Journal reference: Science , DOI: 10.1126/science.aao1498 \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hatfield marine", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "james carlton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven chown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy coghlan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hatfield marine science center oregon state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monash university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "science center oregon state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "misawa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tohoku", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pacific ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-28T22:19:50.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53f8233077488226eb267d5c97da2913b59e05c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaqYXyqzwpkjO", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/lastword", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Extreme gusts of space gas made early black holes enormous", "title_full": "Extreme gusts of space gas made early black holes enormous", "published": "2017-09-28T22:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28161418/behemoth_blackhole.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53f8233077488226eb267d5c97da2913b59e05c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaqYXyqzwpkjO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-28T22:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Extreme gusts of space gas made early black holes enormous", "text": "Extreme gusts of space gas made early black holes enormous A growing void NASA, ESA, and D.

Use of antibiotics in farming promotes the evolution of this resistance, but it has been unclear how countries should cut back on their use. Now epidemiologists have come up with an achievable plan that might cut antibiotic use on farms by 80 per cent. \nBacteria evolve resistance when they encounter antibiotics or acquire resistance genes from other bacteria. Some infections are now becoming incurable, but we are developing few new drugs to fight them, prompting the World Health Organization this month to describe the situation as a \u201c global health emergency \u201d. \nThere is compelling evidence that antibiotics given to livestock lead to antibiotic-resistant infections in people, says Lance Price of George Washington University, in Washington DC. The world is starting to take notice, and major players including China and KFC are planning to stop producing or using meat raised with \u201cmedically important\u201d antibiotics. Advertisement Tipping point \nThese antibiotics are often used to promote growth in farmed animals. Around 130,000 tonnes of antibiotics are given to food animals annually, according to an analysis of global sales data published today. China alone accounts for 78,000 of these. \nThis means the use of antibiotics in animals now outstrips that in humans, as was predicted to happen this year . The team behind the analysis, which includes Thomas Van Boekel of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ETH Zrich, says this means that new resistance mutations are now more likely to arise in other animals than in humans, and calculate that if we continue on the current trajectory, by 2030 we may be giving 200,000 tonnes of antibiotics to animals every year. \nBut we can stop that happening. Boekel\u2019s team has calculated that if rich countries and China capped their use of antibiotics to the current global average \u2013 that\u2019s 50 milligrams per kilogram of milk, meat and eggs produced per year \u2013 then the use of drugs on farms in 2030 will be 60 per cent lower than predicted. \nThey argue that this is realistic, and could be done without much of a reduction in production. After the EU banned the use of antibiotic growth promoters in 2006, countries such as Denmark managed to maintain their production levels while using half this amount of antibiotics. \nEating less animal products would also help. If everyone ate only 165 grams of animal protein a day by 2030 \u2013 which is the expected EU average \u2013 the team calculates that antibiotic consumption by livestock would be 22 per cent lower than current predictions indicate. Urgent tax \nAs a final step, the team calculated that slapping a tax on veterinary antibiotics of half the price of the drug would cut global consumption by nearly a third \u2013 as well as generating billions of dollars in revenue that could be used to develop new drugs and help farmers in poorer countries adopt hygienic practices that make antibiotics unnecessary. \n\u201cThis is not only doable, but urgently needed,\u201d says Ramanan Laxminarayan of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in Washington DC, who worked on the study. He says such a tax could be exacted quickly. \nEach of the plan\u2019s three measures affect each other, but enacting all three in sequence would cut antibiotic use on farms by 80 per cent, the team predict. \nThe effect this will have on resistant infections in people is more difficult to predict, because such infections arise both in farm animals and in people. But a modelling study published earlier this year found that if antibiotics on farms are not limited, simply limiting the use of drugs in people will do little to cut resistance. \nIt\u2019s been a year since the UN called for a global fight against antibiotic resistance , says Laxminarayan. \u201cBut there has been little movement on antibiotic use in the animal sector. Unless we act urgently, the window is closing on continued antibiotic effectiveness.\u201d \nJournal reference: Science , DOI: 10.1126/science.aao1495 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "boekel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debora mackenzie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas van boekel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramanan laxminarayan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laxminarayan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for disease dynamics, economics and policy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swiss federal institute of technology eth zrich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lance price of george washington university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-28T22:19:52.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dbd9292f83628ec3a3e72d9824834a7f934f6fe3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLapEk8SOr1H462aIGZr4cE5V3gMFAvcaNzE7lmYBy5fSiIj_IgeskCYdj88aUd9QIyqcvyz7TMpSjmfhML75p42wf9pADURD3Ww--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/mental-health", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Extreme gusts of space gas made early black holes enormous", "title_full": "Extreme gusts of space gas made early black holes enormous", "published": "2017-09-28T22:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/28161418/behemoth_blackhole.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 61, "comments": 0, "shares": 61}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 14}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dbd9292f83628ec3a3e72d9824834a7f934f6fe3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLapEk8SOr1H462aIGZr4cE5V3gMFAvcaNzE7lmYBy5fSiIj_IgeskCYdj88aUd9QIyqcvyz7TMpSjmfhML75p42wf9pADURD3Ww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-28T22:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Extreme gusts of space gas made early black holes enormous", "text": "Extreme gusts of space gas made early black holes enormous A growing void NASA, ESA, and D.

At the International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide today, Musk announced SpaceX\u2019s plans for an enormous new rocket that he says will go to Mars in 2022 and maybe eventually provide speedy trips around Earth. \nThe rocket, which Musk calls the BFR \u2014 the first and last letters stand for \u201cbig\u201d and \u201crocket\u201d \u2013 is smaller than the one he announced at the same event last year, carrying 150 tonnes compared to the previous design\u2019s 300. It\u2019s still more powerful than any of SpaceX\u2019s or NASA\u2019s other planned rockets. \nMusk said that he plans to replace all of SpaceX\u2019s other space vehicles \u2013 the Falcon 9 and Falcon 9 Heavy rockets and the Dragon capsule \u2013 with this new system. Advertisement \n\u201cAll of our resources will then turn to the BFR, and we believe that we can do this with the revenue we see from launching satellites and from servicing the space station,\u201d he said. \nOnce the BFR is up and running, he said, its first tasks will be satellite launches and bringing cargo and crew to the ISS. Fly me to the moon \nThen, Musk said, it will make its way to the moon . \u201cThis will enable the creation of a lunar base. It\u2019s 2017 \u2013 we should have a lunar base by now,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd then of course Mars, becoming a multi-planet species. Beats the hell out of being a single-planet species.\u201d \nThe top stage of the rocket will be big enough for 40 cabins, each of which could hold up to 5 or 6 people, along with a solar storm shelter and entertainment area. Musk said that after the initial 2022 mission to Mars, he plans to send 4 BFRs to Mars in 2024, two of which are set to be crewed. Musk\u2019s plan is to have them mine water and extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make fuel for return missions. \nAs for landing on Mars, one of the trickiest problems in spaceflight , Musk says that the spacecraft will use a propulsive landing method similar to the one that Falcon 9 rockets use. But unlike the Falcon 9, it won\u2019t have legs, instead landing back on its launch mounts. \nFinally, once SpaceX has sent a BFR to Mars, Musk said that the rockets might be used to travel between cities on Earth, shuttling passengers from New York City to Shanghai in 39 minutes. \n\u201cIn about 6 to 9 months we should start building the first ship,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI feel fairly confident that we should be able to complete the ship and have our first launch in about 5 years. 5 years seems like a long time to me.\u201d \nHowever, Musk has a reputation for setting deadlines that he cannot meet. \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "musk", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elon musk", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "leah crane  elon musk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spacex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international astronautical congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "falcon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adelaide", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-29T10:32:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b19ca4de7e635f1be0ddc669182435bf485f06ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowcyNPt_T7gldhufxOh8d8uwu_mguEJ9cg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/hiv", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Feedback: What is this mysterious 8-legged metal object?", "title_full": "Feedback: What is this mysterious 8-legged metal object?", "published": "2017-09-29T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27180000/stranger-things.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 87, "comments": 0, "shares": 87}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b19ca4de7e635f1be0ddc669182435bf485f06ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowcyNPt_T7gldhufxOh8d8uwu_mguEJ9cg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-29T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Feedback: What is this mysterious 8-legged metal object?", "text": "Feedback: What is this mysterious 8-legged metal object?

One day, a 3D Sphere visits Flatland and whisks away a Square to a higher dimensional world. Square learns that Flatlanders are mere 2D projections of 3D beings. He then has the audacity to suggest that Sphere may be a shadow too \u2013 of a shape in four dimensions. \u201cThe very idea of it is utterly inconceivable,\u201d says the appalled Sphere. \nHenry Markram thinks we might be suffering from a similarly blinkered perspective when considering the workings of our own brains. \u201cWe look at the brain, we see its immense complexity, but if it\u2019s a shadow projection from a higher dimension, we\u2019ll never understand it,\u201d Markram says. Those aren\u2019t idle words: he and his colleagues of the Blue Brain Project at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) have been using algebraic topology, a field of mathematics used to characterise higher-dimensional shapes, to explore the workings of the brain. \nWhat they have found beggars belief. As our brains think, learn and remember, they create elaborate but ephemeral structures in at least seven mathematical dimensions, and possibly many more. What\u2019s more, these transient structures, which appear and disappear like sandcastles on a beach, could help us understand how the brain creates our thoughts and feelings. They might even unravel the greatest mystery of them all: consciousness. \u201cAlgebraic topology is the mathematics to take neuroscience out of Flatland,\u201d says Markram. \nThe Blue Brain Project was launched in 2005, with the aim To  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anil ananthaswamy  edwin abbott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henry markram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "markram", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "swiss federal institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lausanne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flatland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-29T15:27:34.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69efe7c1fe62f155636c3b0299c7df3e43b8d6b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLapoWcYLSLqMh9UFIrRm9WV5p9RW9Wt2ZGgtM_eaW9Ard41mXbbqy2tn5VNfk7kgehY9tl3clQUMa52P9giLToiWUVF56Ro24Xg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/books-art", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Why Puerto Rico still has no electrical power and how to fix it", "title_full": "Why Puerto Rico still has no electrical power and how to fix it", "published": "2017-09-29T17:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/29135019/gettyimages-852615068.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 326, "comments": 0, "shares": 326}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 10}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69efe7c1fe62f155636c3b0299c7df3e43b8d6b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLapoWcYLSLqMh9UFIrRm9WV5p9RW9Wt2ZGgtM_eaW9Ard41mXbbqy2tn5VNfk7kgehY9tl3clQUMa52P9giLToiWUVF56Ro24Xg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-29T17:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Puerto Rico still has no electrical power and how to fix it", "text": "29 September 2017 Why Puerto Rico still has no electrical power and how to fix it Puerto Rico faces a long wait for its damaged electrical grid to be fixed after Hurricane Maria passed through Joe Raedle/Getty By Aylin Woodward \nPuerto Rico is still literally powerless. Though Hurricane Maria made landfall as a category four hurricane over a week ago, the storm has left the island almost entirely without electrical power. \nThe island\u2019s electrical grid was unable to resist the one-two punch of Hurricane Irma followed by Maria. 250-kilometre-per-hour winds and 76 centimetres of rain have left nearly 100 per cent of the island without power. Puerto Rico\u2019s governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 calls the situation a \u201chumanitarian emergency\u201d. \nThe lack of power makes it hard to refrigerate food and to run air conditioning \u2013 both essential in the hot Caribbean climate. What\u2019s more, pumps that push water for drinking, bathing and flushing toilets aren\u2019t working. On Wednesday, FEMA reported that 42 per cent of the population was without potable water and more than 10,000 people were occupying 161 shelters. Advertisement \nNobody knows how long it will take to get the grid back online. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) can\u2019t restore power without assistance, because it filed for bankruptcy in July under a crippling $9 billion debt. \nThe American Public Power Association (APPA), of which PREPA is a member, says the damage must first be assessed before it can determine how long repairs will take. \n\u201c We don\u2019t know if this is going to be a six-month situation, a five-month situation ,\u201d says Mike Hyland, APPA\u2019s senior vice president of engineering. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be rolling crews in. We don\u2019t know how many linemen from the Army Corps of Engineers will be available.\u201d Problem after problem \nPower was swiftly restored on the mainland US, but the situation in Puerto Rico is far worse, says Alexis Kwasinski at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \nManpower is a factor. Places affected by Irma and Harvey benefited from \u201c mutual assistance agreements \u201d, which send electric crews from other states to help with repairs. \nThe severity of the damage is a bigger issue. Power grids are made up of three parts: generation, transmission and distribution. Typically, hurricanes and similar disasters mostly damage the distribution system, says Kwasinski. That\u2019s what happened in Texas and Florida. But in Puerto Rico all three components have been damaged, so the repair job is bigger. \n\u201cMore importantly, those states didn\u2019t completely lose power like Puerto Rico did,\u201d says Kwasinksi. \u201cWhen the whole grid goes down, and you have to begin again from nothing, it\u2019s much more complicated.\u201d \nThis tricky process is called a black start . The challenge is that big power stations need a supply of electricity to start up, which has to come from smaller generators. \nKwasinski compares the generators that supply a power grid to a group of people holding up a big block of concrete. Once the block is up, each additional person makes it more stable, and with care it is possible to keep it up. But if everyone puts the block down, it takes painstaking work to lift it back up again. Is anyone watching? \nMeanwhile the 3.4 million people of Puerto Rico must do without. Nearly all are without cell service and internet, because 1,360 of 1,600 cell towers were taken out by the storm. Most of the island\u2019s infrastructure in is shambles, road closures make it difficult for emergency responders to reach citizens, and airport closures and plane delays have trapped thousands on the island. \nPresident Trump declared a state of disaster on 21 September, yet media attention remained minimal . \nOne reason Puerto Rico hasn\u2019t garnered as much attention as the aftermath of Harvey and Irma is that many Americans don\u2019t realise Puerto Ricans are US citizens, says Brendan Nyhan at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. He and his colleague Kyle Dropp recently published poll results showing that people who did know Puerto Ricans are US citizens were more likely to support federal aid. \n\u201cAs millions of Americans are without electricity and access to potable water, it\u2019s certainly plausible that public pressure will mount,\u201d says Nyhan. \u201cMore US citizens live in Puerto Rico than some US states, and we\u2019d never accept, say, the state of Utah being without power.\u201d Advertisement ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kwasinski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brendan nyhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis kwasinski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricardo rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwasinksk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle dropp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aylin woodward  puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike hyland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "american public power association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico electric power authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dartmouth college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army corps of engineers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "appa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanover", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prepa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-29T18:02:49.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb9719965c565d61737afa15339a52f7bf21627c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowcyNPt_T7glm7F6zfC11xE_x7N0DAXAmpmLU.FiwmVNipc4kDjlYEcK.GfWYAzDx7NuUijGToQZAy1xCWnPwC.EEzaqfFaivQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Why do we have such a close relationship with animals?", "title_full": "Why do we have such a close relationship with animals?", "published": "2017-09-30T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27180000/p_hopk12240-2005cl40.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 85, "comments": 0, "shares": 85}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb9719965c565d61737afa15339a52f7bf21627c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowcyNPt_T7glm7F6zfC11xE_x7N0DAXAmpmLU.FiwmVNipc4kDjlYEcK.GfWYAzDx7NuUijGToQZAy1xCWnPwC.EEzaqfFaivQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-30T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why do we have such a close relationship with animals?", "text": "27 September 2017 Why do we have such a close relationship with animals?

It even has a name \u2013 anthrozoology \u2013 as biologist John Bradshaw reminds us in the subtitle of his new book, The Animals Among Us . \nAs Bradshaw points out, for humans to consistently live with and nurture animals is a most unusual trait in nature. So a strong, fact-based discussion of how and why we do this and its effects should be eye-opening, engaging and thought-provoking. \nAnimals ticks some of those boxes, but by no means all. Bradshaw knows how to produce a well-written and accessible tome. A veteran of popular books about the lives and habits of cats and dogs, he focuses most on the ubiquity of people keeping animals, today and over the past few hundred years, and specifically on pets. \nAs he rightly observes, the practice of taking in and raising young animals is widespread among humans, little influenced by geography or culture. Oddly, though, he seems shocked that this intimacy can extend to the breast-feeding of young animals, domestic or wild. This isn\u2019t rare in many modern cultures and probably wasn\u2019t in the past. Calling groups who engage in the behaviour \u201csurviving Palaeolithic peoples\u201d, as he does, is inaccurate and culturally insensitive. \nBradshaw suggests that the inclusion of animals as intimate members of the family probably explains the long-term connection behind the genetic and behavioural alterations we now see in domestic species. \nEven so, domestication is a less common outcome of keeping animals than we might expect, given that even the most generous list would only include 20 or so domesticated species. Many more have spent at least some time in captivity, so it is well worth asking why so many species that have lived intimately with us haven\u2019t been domesticated. \u201cIt\u2019s worth asking why so many species that have lived with us have never been domesticated\u201d \nFor Bradshaw, the answer lies partly in the kinds of societies that kept animals. He reasons that in egalitarian, hunter-gatherer societies, animals could be brought into the family and kept temporarily before being eaten or sacrificed, or perhaps kept more permanently. As these societies gave way to stratified, agricultural societies, the animals that were kept depended on their benefit to the household at that time. \nDuring this period, keeping domesticated animals became a status symbol \u2013 leading to the rise of pets. Part of their appeal, says Bradshaw (on little evidence), is an atavistic liking of stroking and grooming the fur of another, which he believes played a role in our ancestral, furry past (we lost most of it some 1.6 million years ago) as it does now among non-human primates. \nBut do we really keep pets so we can stroke them? Stroking a pet has been shown to raise circulating levels of the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone oxytocin in both participants. Why don\u2019t we keep pets that stroke us back? \nBradshaw\u2019s main interest seems to lie in the period between medieval times and the 20th century, which makes this part of the book especially lively and informative. The Victorian era saw the rise of keeping pets and the display of animals with particular colours or shapes to confer status. This was also the time that breed societies and animal shows were founded, and there was a general growth of desirable \u201ctypes\u201d among all kinds of domestic species, particularly in the UK. \nBradshaw discusses this period at length, dwelling on the transformation of pets from working animals to \u201cmembers of the family\u201d as the attributes of domesticated species became a reflection of social standing. And in agricultural Britain, having good livestock or animals was of tremendous importance to their owners\u2019 success. Cute or crazy? Constantine Manos/Magnum Photos \nModern life generally is now very different, more industrialised and urban, but the animals we live with continue to carry great social and symbolic weight. According to Bradshaw, Westerners have reached the third phase of living with animals, where the practice is so common that it is universally accepted. \nIn fact, pets are increasingly seen as offering us tangible benefits \u2013 as therapy animals, assistants to people who are blind or disabled, and companions to those who are socially isolated. Pets are often said to provide distinct health benefits to those with mental, social or physical problems, though Bradshaw points out that the evidence isn\u2019t as strong as the claims for it. \nIn one of the best and most thought-provoking parts of his book, Bradshaw dissects the practice of anthropomorphism as a typically human attempt to understand the animals with which we live so intimately. He raises important questions about the greater significance of keeping pets and their benefits. For example, is assigning human characteristics to another species really key to the close emotional and family-type relationships many humans form with their pets? Does anthropomorphism balance out the energetic and economic costs of pets in the modern world? \nI take a very different view: anthropomorphism is as much a barrier to domestication and close relationships with animals as it is a boon. My view of domestication is that humans and the species that find it worthwhile negotiate a common language \u2013 a world view that is neither human nor animal. \nEven very clever dogs can\u2019t understand more than a few hundred words, and they don\u2019t share our framework for perception. Simply put, we perceive very little of what a dog does: for example, we are nearly scent-blind. Equally, dogs don\u2019t perceive as we do nor think about things the way we do. For true cooperation and communication, dogs and humans must each alter their \u201clanguage\u201d so they understand each other. This process is active, a choice as well as an evolutionary adaptation. Casting a dog\u2019s actions in human terms is tempting for a human, but doesn\u2019t further the exchange of ideas by much. \nAt the end of the book, Bradshaw brings it all together by proposing four explanations of the human propensity for keeping pets. First, he reminds us of the idea that the loss of most of our body hair left us with a liking for stroking and grooming. \nHis second concerns the evolution of the human brain in a way that resulted in us being able to analyse animal behaviour and develop the capacity for anthropomorphism, leading to better animal-keeping. \nHis third explanation is that young women who were good at caring for animals may have been assumed to become better mothers, making them preferred as brides. This could cause a spread of genes that would make many people good with animals. \u201cDoes anthropomorphism balance out the energetic and economic costs of pets in the modern world?\u201d \nAnd last, he hypothesises that the rise of taboos against eating and killing personal (owned) animals enabled long-term pet-keeping, which is necessary for domestication. I am sceptical about this scenario since, again, little hard evidence supports it or links each stage to the next. \nI wish Bradshaw had included more evidence on the much-researched origin of dogs. Surely the first instance of domestication in the world, of wolves into dogs, should play a crucial role in our understanding of the phenomenon of living with and domesticating animals? \nBut Bradshaw doesn\u2019t dwell on the ongoing and exciting work investigating the genetic, morphological and behavioural differences among wolves and some dogs, including ancient fossil specimens. He neglects research on basal or genetically ancestral breeds, such as basenjis, dingoes and the recently rediscovered New Guinea mountain dogs. These species should tell us a lot about the sort of canid that was originally domesticated. \nBradshaw also gives short shrift to work by leading scholars, such as Mietje Germonpr\u00e9 at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and Melinda Zeder at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. And he often supports his arguments with out-of-date contributions to the field or articles in popular magazines or newspapers rather than peer-reviewed journals. \nThis means that he gives too much credence to ideas that haven\u2019t been rigorously tested or that have been overturned by later studies. While there are many good things in his book, understanding and interpreting our tendency to live with animals and its impact is an important and vibrant field that deserves a fuller presentation than Bradshaw offers here.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mietje germonpr\u00e9", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat shipman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melinda zeder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john bradshaw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradshaw", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "royal belgian institute of natural sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smithsonian institution", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new guinea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-30T13:21:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3eea01cdb05a012f8a959b91a34c49ff5efb3e4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowcyNPt_T7gl6quBhHhlCWkm6GYiFSEtsYJrPNpiPrIw_vynMdId5oYTSsdS0KyNFtJhg01jxFkq", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/books-art", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Supersonic car project aims to carry kids to a scientific future", "title_full": "Supersonic car project aims to carry kids to a scientific future", "published": "2017-10-01T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27180000/hrgeely-61_pic-credit_stefan-marjoram.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3eea01cdb05a012f8a959b91a34c49ff5efb3e4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowcyNPt_T7gl6quBhHhlCWkm6GYiFSEtsYJrPNpiPrIw_vynMdId5oYTSsdS0KyNFtJhg01jxFkq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-01T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Supersonic car project aims to carry kids to a scientific future", "text": "Supersonic car project aims to carry kids to a scientific future Engaging students\u2019 drive By Chris Fairhead \nTHE world land speed record for cars has seen its share of British success. The nation\u2019s latest such endeavour is encapsulated in the supersonic Bloodhound SSC, but it is about far more than building a fast car. It also aims to engage and inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers by showcasing STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines in a variety of exciting ways. \nIn late October, Bloodhound SSC will start runway testing in Newquay, UK, at speeds of up to 300 kilometres per hour. This will provide valuable data and experience before the team heads for South Africa to chase a new world record speed of more than 1600 kilometres per hour. Importantly, it will also provide a real-life science showcase for the 250,000 young people who participate in Bloodhound-related workshops each year. \nThese activities, run by the charity Bloodhound Education, form one of the biggest STEM programmes in the UK, and one that engages students from primary school age to PhD level. Our various workshops combine hands-on activity with classroom instruction, along with a competitive element to involve and enthuse even the most laconic student. \nThe next stage of the programme will involve providing real data from the car, so students can participate in the decision-making as the engineers continue to develop the vehicle.

From the start, his vision was of a fully fledged space age, but after fleeing Nazi Germany for the US, he drifted at the fringes of real technical work. \nHe was also a visionary, garnering popular support through aspirational narratives that bridged the chasm between the cold equations of space flight and its romantic possibilities. Over time, Ley has been eclipsed by better-known actors such as Wernher von Braun (whom he knew well) and Isaac Asimov. Now a fascinating new biography by Jared Buss restores him as a central figure in the history of rocketry and its popularisation. \nLey\u2019s role was complex, and his life took an intriguing and meandering path through many of the 20th century\u2019s key events: the rise of airborne technology after the first world war; rocketry\u2019s beginnings; the Nazis\u2019 ascent; the cold war; the popularisation of the idea of space travel; and, finally, as apotheosis, the first moon landing, which occurred mere weeks after his death. \nLey\u2019s prodigious output reflected the two sides of his character. As a public speaker and a writer for magazines such as Popular Mechanics and Amazing Stories , he romanticised the natural world, and gloried in the idea of brave explorers setting off into an unknown that awed and fascinated him. At the same time, his expertise and attachment to hard facts when discussing, for example, the technical details of weapons, revealed a man with hard-nosed engineering instincts. \nThose instincts were hampered by a lack of technical education \u2013 he studied astronomy, zoology, physics and palaeontology at the University of Berlin. His wide-ranging curiosity never found its academic niche, and his ideas on the history of science remained those of autodidact and outsider. \nBuffeted by the currents of contemporary politics, he was often frustrated by his failed attempts to kick-start or be involved in research on rocket engines. But Ley was always driven by a greater vision, which went beyond the bid for outer space. There is a wistfulness about his strenuously argued belief that education and critical reasoning are the source of democracy and progress. The reality was more complex, as Sputnik showed. \u201cLey was always driven by a greater vision, which went beyond the bid for outer space\u201d \nWhile close to the main actors, but excluded from contributing technically to the development of rockets, Ley settled on the role of proselytiser, fearlessly (or maybe shamelessly) preaching from all possible pulpits: television, radio and print media, but also via toy companies and Walt Disney, as a consultant for \u201cTomorrowland\u201d in Disneyland in the 1950s. \nHe remained a public figure to the last, though his views became visibly dated as the heroic space narratives of the 1940s and 1950s, powered by an unbounded belief in technology, were replaced by more measured and critical views. \nBuss\u2019s book has weaknesses, particularly in its earlier chapters. Short repeated sentences, clich\u00e9d expressions and overly detailed recountings of the plots of several of Ley\u2019s stories add to a sense of meandering. Some incorrectly spelled German text also suggests a lack of basic editorial checks. \nMore surprisingly for the work of a historian, the book, at least to start with, spins its tale from a thin set of sources, relying often on speculation rather than facts. Buss is happy to distance himself from Ley\u2019s world view and his reminiscences of the intellectual climate and rise of pseudoscience in Nazi Germany, but he doesn\u2019t offer the reader enough historical context to understand how those views might have taken hold. \nIn an odd way, Ley saves the book from beyond the grave, as it were. His indefatigable vision of space flight as part of humanity\u2019s next step into the cosmos, his optimism about the future and conviction that science is the key to bettering humankind are compelling values.

Everyday objects could soon be used to control your television thanks to a technique that uses a webcam to recognise movements. \nThe system, called Matchpoint, allows you to select different objects, or body parts, to control aspects of the television. To set it up, the TV screen first displays icons representing functions, such as volume or changing channels. Once one has been selected, a chosen object is used to draw a circle in the air when prompted, transforming it into a remote control. A cup, for example, could then be used to adjust the volume by moving it laterally to coincide with a slider control onscreen. It retains its role as long as the camera can see it moving. \nSimilar systems typically identify objects or people. However, a change of position can affect recognition and cause them to fail. In one of its moddes, Matchpoint simply looks for movement, different people can operate the controls and the object doesn\u2019t even need to be in full view. Advertisement \nFalse activation can be an issue with gesture control, if a person accidentally makes the commanding signal. Christopher Clarke at Lancaster University, UK, who developed Matchpoint with his colleagues, designed it with this in mind, choosing a circular motion to link an object with a control that is hard to make unintentionally. In addition, the controls aren\u2019t active while watching a show when they are hidden from view. Surgical use \nIt\u2019s well-suited for multi-tasking, too. It would be handy when your hands are occupied with something else, says Chris Harrison at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who researches new ways of interacting with computers. \u201cWhile making dinner in the kitchen, this could be very useful.\u201d \nMedical professionals have expressed an interest for the same reason. Surgeons sometimes have to access information on a screen during surgery, for example. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have to put the tools down and touch anything, which would be unhygienic,\u201d says Clarke. \nFocusing on movement makes the system accessible to a wider range of people. Whereas hand gestures are restrictive for people with certain disabilities, Matchpoint can be easily tailored to individual needs. \nIn everyday situations though, using objects as controls could be just a novelty. \u201cA remote control or more rudimentary hand gestures might be more practical,\u201d says Harrison. Since the system relies on a webcam, it struggles when lighting is poor. And if a chosen object is too small, it would be hard for the system to track it. \nStill, Clarke and his team plan to add additional functions.

That means we have time to prepare Are there social consequences to extending life? Niall McDiarmid/Millennium Images, UK \nON 17 October 1995, a French woman called Jeanne Calment set a new official record for human longevity: 120 years and 238 days. When she died, she was 122 years, 164 days. Her record still stands. \nYou might conclude from this that research aimed at extending the human lifespan has gone nowhere, and that 120 or so remains a non-negotiable upper limit. If the radical claims of life extension science are true, where are all the supercentenarians? \nThe answer is: they are still in middle age. Today\u2019s oldest person, a Japanese woman called Nabi Tajima, turned 97 the day Calment died \u2013 already too old to benefit from treatments aimed at slowing or reversing ageing. We won\u2019t start to see any population-level effects of targeted life extension for another 30 to 40 years, when today\u2019s septuagenarians may be entering their 12th decade in increasing numbers. Advertisement \nWhether this will happen is still an open question. Nothing has yet been shown to work in humans, although there are promising avenues , including research on the rejuvenating effects of young blood (see \u201c Exclusive: Inside the clinic offering young blood to cure ageing \u201c). Most may prove to be dead ends, but the quantity of research effort and money that has been poured into anti-ageing suggests that if it is possible, it is going to happen. \nThat is good news for individuals, but a challenge for society. Consider that Tajima was born in the 19th century and reached retirement age more than 57 years ago. Now extrapolate that life trajectory to large numbers of people. Bioethicists have long flagged concerns about the social consequences of life extension, including overpopulation and the prospect of a \u201ccare home world\u201d full of decrepit people. These problems are half a lifetime away, and are unlikely to be a deal-breaker. But it is not too soon to start thinking seriously about how we should deal with them. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cLive long, and prosper?\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "calment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nabi tajima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeanne calment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tajima", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-02T13:37:31.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d134a1410e92bcab536dd95879db7bacde92cc01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLasYZCO3LbHN4Llk03f.AZzVx9n6ew02YtltJALszlItpH05KWT_rZ21g5FLz6GveXpsMbyRbzI4mJPSvzkxMIW7kLdXMBNY5bA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/cosmology", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Science fiction picks sound wedding bells and other alarms", "title_full": "Science fiction picks sound wedding bells and other alarms", "published": "2017-10-02T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/02090056/gettyimages-610808145.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d134a1410e92bcab536dd95879db7bacde92cc01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLasYZCO3LbHN4Llk03f.AZzVx9n6ew02YtltJALszlItpH05KWT_rZ21g5FLz6GveXpsMbyRbzI4mJPSvzkxMIW7kLdXMBNY5bA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-02T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Science fiction picks sound wedding bells and other alarms", "text": "2 October 2017 Science fiction picks sound wedding bells and other alarms People are stronger together, according to the latest crop of novels by Maggie Shen King, M. T. Anderson and Dave Hutchinson Henrik Sorensen/Getty By Abigail Nussbaum \nIn the near-future China of Maggie Shen King\u2019s An Excess Male (Harper Voyager), the country\u2019s one-child policy has resulted in a shortage of eligible women, and a vast, unmarriageable male population. Viewing this as a potential source of civil unrest, the government vastly restricts people\u2019s rights and freedoms, and encourages them to enter into polyandrous marriages. Forty-something Wei-guo has finally saved enough money to enter into negotiations to become the third husband of May-ling, already married to brothers Hann and Xiong-xin. The novel switches between their four points of view in order to explore the stresses of such an arrangement, as well as the social forces that can make it advantageous and even desirable. \nOne can sense the influence of Margaret Attwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in King\u2019s construction of her future society, particularly her use of neologisms and the repressive social policies they stand for, designed to \u201csolve\u201d the problem of the excess male population. Gay men are dubbed Willfully Sterile, forced to either register or be hospitalised. Men who have difficulty socialising or have autism are designated Lost Boys and can be institutionalised and sterilised. Single men like Wei-guo are assigned Helpmates for impersonal \u201chygiene sessions\u201d in which the authorities prescribe the precise extent of sexual contact. \nDespite these policies and the unhappiness they cause, An Excess Male is less a dystopia than it is a novel of manners, in which each of the characters must navigate norms both old and new in order to arrive at that holy grail of so much fiction: a good marriage. King and her characters are open about the flaws of the novel\u2019s social structures; the later chapters focus on a terrible act of abuse, which the characters struggle to expose. But An Excess Male also suggests that the exigencies of its premise have opened the door to new definitions, not just of marriage, but of masculinity. \nFar from devolving into brutality and violence, as their government fears, the societies that arise in the novel give men the opportunity to be nurturing and supportive. Polyandrous marriages, similarly, offer the male characters companionship not just with their wives, but with each other, as exemplified by Wei-guo\u2019s fathers who, though straight, remain married even after his mother\u2019s death. While King can hardly be said to be advocating the society she describes, which victimises and entraps both men and women, An Excess Male does end with the creation of a new family: one that requires all four spouses to function. \nA different combination of dystopia and romance can be found in M. T. Anderson\u2019s Landscape With Invisible Hand (Candlewick Press). \nWhen Earth is discovered by the alien vuvv, they initially claim to have come in peace, offering technological breakthroughs in exchange for resources. The reality, however, is the type of colonisation and exploitation familiar from Earth\u2019s own history. As the economy collapses, a tiny sliver of the population live like kings, serving the vuvv, while the remainder are left jobless and scrambling for survival. \nSince the vuvv exoticise and fetishise human behavior, teenager Adam and his girlfriend Chloe decide to broadcast their relationship to an admiring alien audience, selling a vision of romance carefully tailored to appeal to the vuvv\u2019s simplistic understanding of human customs. \nAdam also hopes to win an art contest organised by the vuvv. The vuvv, however, are put off by his choosing to depict the ravages caused by their arrival. After all, they explain, they can see vuvv installations anywhere, and they much prefer the \u201cwild\u201d Earth depicted in Adam\u2019s more fantastical paintings. \nThe resulting story feels like a cross between The Hunger Games and the Black Mirror episode \u201cFifteen Million Merits\u201d, pondering the cost of selling yourself to an audience that does not recognise your humanity. Adam and Chloe\u2019s relationship crumbles under the strain of having to model what the vuvv take human love to be, and Adam is inevitably forced to choose between artistic integrity and his family\u2019s future. The speed with which the characters go from middle-class security and self-confidence to bare subsistence might strike adult readers as a little overdetermined. But the combination of non-standard sci-fi ingredients, such as the focus on art and reality TV, and an extremely dark sense of humour, give Landscape With Invisible Hand a flavour all its own, one that will appeal to readers of any age. \nLeaving Earth for the far reaches of outer space, Dave Hutchinson\u2019s novella Acadie (Tor.com) focuses on Duke Faraday, the reluctant president of an anarchic space colony that has for centuries been relentlessly pursued by Earth\u2019s Bureau of Colonisation. His job, run on the principle that only people with no interest in politics should be entrusted with public office, is usually a light one. But when a BoC probe appears in the colony\u2019s system, he must corral a population of independent-minded geniuses and misfits to arrange an evacuation that will leave Earth clueless as to their new whereabouts. \nReaders familiar with the political slant of Hutchinson\u2019s Fractured Europe sequence will be puzzled to find him writing about a Robert Heinlein-esque libertarian utopia, and perhaps fatigued by the dozens of paragraphs of explaining the colony\u2019s workings. Not surprisingly, then, the story ends with a twist, but this, alas, is delivered so abruptly as to leave one feeling even more wrong-footed. Lost in space, as it were. \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert heinlein-esque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave hutchinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke faraday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abigail nussbaum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hutchinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m. t. anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harper voyager", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave hutchinson henrik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chloe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maggie shen king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret attwood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bureau of colonisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "candlewick press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black mirror", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-02T13:37:37.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4641174af2a232fb565e73aa570b1a5b3abca4b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXoyaOfu8OW3avlzL.lbWxfed7IQCwax8Enf_3DUUikUrwyCK_m9BrSoWaAjDo4ffqkWmG4AWk3qWZBVkTqjb4ACk2adHS6gIJMR_6KDtzeSQ0", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/interviews", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Fighting fakery: How to make products immune to counterfeiting", "title_full": "Fighting fakery: How to make products immune to counterfeiting", "published": "2017-10-02T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/27180000/unfakeable_main.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4641174af2a232fb565e73aa570b1a5b3abca4b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXoyaOfu8OW3avlzL.lbWxfed7IQCwax8Enf_3DUUikUrwyCK_m9BrSoWaAjDo4ffqkWmG4AWk3qWZBVkTqjb4ACk2adHS6gIJMR_6KDtzeSQ0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-02T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fighting fakery: How to make products immune to counterfeiting", "text": "27 September 2017 Fighting fakery: How to make products immune to counterfeiting Alcohol, medicine, money, car airbags \u2013 you name it, it's been faked.

In February, they finally picked him up and charged him with \u201cselling goods liable to be mistaken for a registered trademark\u201d. That might not sound like a heinous offence, but the goods in question were counterfeit car airbags that would not have worked properly in a collision. Police have alerted 680 people they think bought the airbags on eBay, and Czernik is due to be tried in the coming weeks. \nIt\u2019s a reminder that all manner of goods are subject to fakery. People have tried to counter the problem for hundreds of years using devices intended to prove authenticity. In the Middle Ages, elaborate wax seals were the method of choice in Europe. Today, holograms and watermarks are ubiquitous. But the principle has remained the same all along: tag goods with an object that is extremely difficult to copy. Trouble is, \u201cextremely difficult\u201d isn\u2019t always good enough \u2013 we need tags that are impossible to copy. \nThat is not beyond our wits. The basic recipe for unfakable tags has been around for 15 years, but it was always too complicated, costly and impractical.

Copyright: Nobel Media AB 2017 By Douglas Heaven \nThe 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded jointly to Jeffrey C Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W Young for their work on the mechanisms controlling circadian rhythms \u2013 the internal clocks that living organisms use to track the day-night cycle. \nAll life on Earth has evolved on a planet that spins on its axis once every 24 hours. As different parts of its surface face the sun, conditions can change dramatically. Days bring warmth and light, nights are cool and dark. A biological clock in the cells of plants, animals and humans anticipates these fluctuations to optimise behaviour and physiology. \nThe existence of an inner clock has been known about since 1729 when French scientist Jean-Jaques d\u2019Ortous de Mairan found that the daily movement of a plant\u2019s leaves to track the sun continued when it was kept in the dark. There must be something inside plants controlling the daily progression. But what that was remained a mystery for a long time. Advertisement \nOur biological clock helps to regulate sleep patterns, feeding behavior, hormone release and blood pressure #NobelPrize pic.twitter.com/NgL7761AFE \n\u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 2, 2017 \nTo find out, this year\u2019s Nobel laureates looked inside the cells of fruit flies to see how they ticked. In 1984 they studied a gene called period . Hall and Rosbach found that it acts like an hour glass, producing a protein that accumulates in the cell during the night and then degrades during the day. \nThey then found that this ebb and flow is controlled by the period protein itself, which inhibits the activity of the gene that makes it. As levels increase, production stops. The same gene was found to be at work in other organisms too, including humans. 24-hour cycle \nFor this mechanism to work, the period protein must get into the nucleus so that it can regulate the DNA that makes it, and this is where Young came in. He identified another clock gene called timeless . This gene produces a second protein that binds to the period protein and helps it enter a cell\u2019s nucleus. \nYoung later also found a gene called doubletime , which finetunes the timing of this clock so that our cells work in a 24-hour cycle. \nSince circadian rhythms seem to control so many of our biological processes, these discoveries have profound implications for our understanding of disease and all-round well-being, says the Nobel committee. Chronic mismatches in circadian rhythm have been linked to many conditions, from cancer to depression , and researchers are now using light to reset body clocks to treat a number of brain disorders . \nThe announcements for this year\u2019s awards continue with physics on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.

Almost all of these involve removing cells from an individual\u2019s body, editing their DNA and then putting them back into the body. \nThis approach has immense promise, for instance, it is being used to alter immune cells to make them better at killing cancers . It\u2019s relatively easy to remove immune cells or blood stem cells, edit them, and then return them to the body, but this isn\u2019t possible with most bodily tissues. Advertisement \nSo editing cells inside the body would allow us to treat far more conditions \u2013 from genetic disorders to high cholesterol \u2013 and would also be cheaper than growing and editing cells outside the body. What diseases could be treated this way? \u201cAbsolutely everything,\u201d says Irina Conboy of the University of California, Berkeley. Liver disease \nThe big challenge is delivering the CRISPR machinery to tissues inside the body. Editing genes with CRISPR requires at least two components: a protein that cuts DNA and a piece of RNA that guides it to the precise DNA site to make the cut. \nProteins and RNAs are enormous molecules compared with conventional drugs. It\u2019s hard to get them inside cells, and they don\u2019t usually survive in the bloodstream, either. \nBut biologists have been working on delivering big molecules to cells for decades and are now adapting various methods for genome editing. Intellia Therapeutics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, for instance, is using fatty particles to deliver the CRISPR components to livers. \nOne aim is to treat a rare genetic disease called transthyretin amyloidosis, caused by excessive production of the TTR protein. Last week, the company reported that it managed to disable the TTR gene in the livers of mice, reducing levels of the protein by 97 per cent with no signs of any ill effects . \nIntellia is also working on a cure for hepatitis B , which infects 250 million people worldwide. The virus can be difficult to eliminate because viral DNA can linger in liver cells. CRISPR can destroy this DNA . \nThe liver is the easiest organ to deliver fatty particles to because it filters the blood. Anything injected into the blood supply is likely to reach the organ. Conboy\u2019s team has managed something more difficult: they have treated the muscle-wasting disease muscular dystrophy in mice by injecting gold nanoparticles carrying the CRISPR components directly into muscle. Muscular dystrophy \nWhat\u2019s more, Conboy\u2019s team actually fixed the faulty gene rather than simply disabling it, as Intellia did. Repairing genes is much harder than disabling them. It only worked in 5 per cent of muscle cells, but that was enough to boost muscle strength. And Conboy thinks the proportion of repaired cells could be increased by repeated injections of the gold nanoparticles, although her group has not yet shown this. \n\u201cI think this delivery method is fantastic for certain applications,\u201d says Jeffrey Chamberlain at the University of Washington. However, to treat disorders such as muscular dystrophy, muscles all around the body \u2013 including the heart \u2013 need to be edited. They cannot all be injected directly, so the group hopes to find a way to get the gold nanoparticles into tissues throughout the body. \nChamberlain has been able to edit tissues all over the body using viruses. Earlier this year, his team successfully treated muscular dystrophy in mice by injecting them with an adeno-associated virus carrying DNA coding for the CRISPR components. Avoiding errors \nBut there is a big safety issue with viral delivery. If the cutting protein is added to cells, as in the gold nanoparticle method, it soon breaks down. But the viral method involves inserting the DNA for the protein into cells instead, which means the cutting protein keeps being made for weeks after treatment. This greatly increases the chance of DNA also being cut in the wrong place, says Chamberlain. \nAlready, though, Nicole Deglon of Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland and colleagues have developed a way to prevent the cutting protein lingering for too long when viruses are used for delivery. Their \u201ckamikaze\u201d CRISPR system not only disables the target gene, it also disables the gene for the cutting protein after a short delay. \nLast month, her team showed that this system reduces off-target effects in a mouse study targeting the gene that causes Huntington\u2019s disease. What\u2019s more, they managed to disable the gene in 65 per cent of cells in the key area of the animals\u2019 brains. \u201cI was amazed to see how efficient it was,\u201d says Deglon. \nAltogether, a range of methods for delivering CRISPR are showing promise, suggesting the technique\u2019s potential for treating some of our most difficult diseases could soon be realised. It\u2019s impossible to say how soon trials in humans will begin, says Deglon. But the field is advancing so rapidly that it may not be that long. \u201cIt\u2019s going faster and faster,\u201d she says. \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael le page", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irina conboy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intellia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey chamberlain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chamberlain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deglon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicole deglon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conboy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of california, berkeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lausanne university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intellia therapeutics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-02T19:19:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72652add17168dd61fbf389c4a3445d8eaf2bee8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLalmPHRqlnndKx7VL.73IgSEi285.AEsyYKjK62eU3xd9m_0xzmm1Gr4IHFt2wf_wSp_uNP7zYRe6Alf8cCx3ZPRXQIjCV_pG_Q--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/brain", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "The real deal?

The lowdown on counterfeits you meet day to day From cash to car parts, and drugs to drink, here\u2019s how much of the stuff you buy and use is probably fake \u2013 and how to tell Stephen Barnes/Middle East / Alamy Stock Photo By Joshua Howgego \nHave you ever bought a knock-off handbag, or been tempted to watch an illegal copy of a film? If you have, you\u2019d be in good company. 90 per cent of adults find the idea of buying counterfeit goods morally wrong, according to a survey in the UK , but many of those asked did it anyway \u2013 42 per cent admitted buying pirated films and music, for example (see chart, below). Advertisement \nEven if you baulk at the idea of buying fake goods, it\u2019s more than likely you\u2019ve used them without even realising it. But there are some simple ways to know whether you\u2019re buying the real deal, if you know what to look out for. Read more: Fighting fakery \u2013 How to make products immune to counterfeiting Alcohol \nFancy a cool glass of wine, or perhaps a gin and tonic? Make sure it isn\u2019t fake alcohol, which can be lethal, especially spirits. The problem is that unless they are distilled with care, some methanol can get in. Methanol is much more toxic than ethanol; drink enough and you could go blind and die. \nIn spite of that, after films, music and clothes, alcohol was the most popular counterfeit item purchased by those UK survey respondents was. In 2014, HMRC, the UK customs authority, seized 2500 litres of fake wine and spirits in a single pre-Christmas crackdown . \nSo how can you tell fake alcohol from the real thing? The UK Food Standard Agency suggests thinking in terms of four Ps. Watch out when you\u2019re buying the most routinely faked Products, like vodka. If the Price looks too good to be true, it probably is. Shoddy Packaging is another giveaway. And think about Place too; don\u2019t trust booze that isn\u2019t from a reputable establishment. Food \nThe UK was hit by a horse meat scandal in 2013, with horse being passed off as other meats and getting into food sold by the nation\u2019s retailers. In July, three men were sentenced to a combined total of 114 months in jail for their part in the debacle. \nFood fraud is a broad church; it can also mean labelling cheap cheese as bona fide Parmesan, or diluting premium olive oil with sunflower oil. That makes it hard to say how much of an issue it is, but we do know certain foods to be particularly problematic \u2014 manuka honey sales around the world, for example, are five times higher than the amount produced. \nThere\u2019s probably not a lot individuals can do to detect food fraud, because processing does such a lot to disguise its origins. But the authorities can use DNA tests at random points in the production chains to keep track of what ingredients are really present . The US Food and Drug Administration has published a DNA database for about 250 commonly caught fish, which can be used to identify their presence. \nSeveral supermarkets, including the US giant Walmart, are piloting public databases that show the provenance and processing of each of its food products. These databases use blockchain technology, which can\u2019t be tampered with without leaving traces, so in principle can give consumers more confidence in where their food came from. Cash \nIt\u2019s obvious why you\u2019d want to forge a banknote, but how much of a problem are they? Our best indication is the number of fake banknotes removed from circulation each year, though the real number of fakes is probably higher. The Bank of England removed 347,000 banknotes in 2016, about 0.1 per cent of the number out there . The figure for US dollars is lower: about 0.005 per cent of the currency in circulation is fake. The US Secret Service seized $30 million worth at the end of last year. \nIn the UK, \u00a320 notes seem to be the most commonly faked (see chart, below). Shops have been able to spot fake notes by drawing lines on notes with special pens that react to starch in paper, but these will be useless with the transition to new polymer notes . There are, however, other clues to look out for . \nCoins can be even more of a problem. In the UK, about 2.6 per cent of \u00a31 coins circulating in 2015 were fakes according to the Royal Mint. However, the new 12-sided \u00a31 \u2014 \u201cthe most secure coin in the world\u201d according to the Mint \u2014 should be much harder to forge. For example, it has an image on the front that changes from a \u00a3 symbol to the number 1 when viewed from different angles. Medicines \nThe problem of fake drugs is most acute in developing countries, where as much as 30 per cent of medicine may be fake , according to Interpol. Residents of wealthy countries are on much safer ground if getting supplies from a pharmacy. But don\u2019t try buying drugs online. The WHO estimates that half the drugs sold online are fake . In the last major Interpol operation against the counterfeiters, in 2015, fake drugs worth $81 million were seized and 156 people arrested . \nResearchers in Switzerland who studied a range of counterfeit pills recovered from operations like this found that many have similarities, including batch numbers and chemical composition, suggesting that a single sophisticated gang might be behind a large fraction of these fakes worldwide. Fake comments on social media \nFire up Facebook, navigate to a post by a news organisation and have a look at the comments. Chances are that at least one in 10 is from a fake user. Why? Well, it makes sense for organisations to want \u201clikes\u201d for their pages; it makes them look popular. To cash in on that desire, there are firms offering to sell people likes that it will deliver via bots. Those bots can be programmed to spout certain points of view, making it seem to the casual observer as though lots of real people hold them. It\u2019s sometimes known as astroturfing , because it produces something that looks like grassroots activism, and it doesn\u2019t just affect Facebook. \nIf you think you have spotted a fake account on Facebook, you can go to the profile, click on the ellipsis symbol in their cover photo and click \u201creport\u201d .

Explosive burps of methane flowing into young Mars\u2019s atmosphere might have temporarily warmed the planet, allowing liquid water to persist even after Mars entered its dry period. Rovers and orbiters have found evidence that Mars had rivers 3 billion years ago, suggesting things occasionally warmed up enough for ice to melt and flow as water, sometimes for a million years. \nThe reason might have been giant bursts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, according to Edwin Kite of the University of Chicago. These methane deposits, which may date to the birth of Mars, could even be responsible for temporary methane burps spotted by modern Mars spacecraft. \nThe methane bursts would have happened as Mars wobbled on its axis. Like Earth, Mars is tilted on its axis, but that tilt can change wildly over time because of relationships between its orbit and that of Jupiter. When Mars was extremely tilted, its ice deposits spent more time in direct sunlight, so they could have melted. This would free methane trapped in the ice crystals. Advertisement \n\u201cIt\u2019s basically ice that you can set on fire. You can flick a lighter at it, and get a flame,\u201d he says. \u201cIn your hand, it looks like ice, but at the pressures at Earth\u2019s surface, it is unstable so it releases methane gas.\u201d Explosive eruptions \nDuring periods of extreme Martian tilt, the stored methane would explosively erupt into the atmosphere, warming it enough to melt frozen lakes and start rivers flowing. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun would eventually break down the methane, but it could persist for up to a million years, says Kite. \nThe timing and duration of extreme-tilt events matches the duration and relative rarity of lake-forming climates in Mars\u2019s history, his team found. Adding a 1 per cent dose of methane to a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, at the same pressure as Earth\u2019s atmosphere, would raise temperatures by 6\u00b0C \u2013 enough to melt Martian ice. \nThis would only be possible if Mars also had a blanket of CO 2 to keep it warm, too, Kite says. The methane would just be an added boost. But recent evidence suggests Mars may not have had as much CO 2 as researchers thought. Missing elements \nThomas Bristow of NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center and his colleagues recently found a dearth of carbonate minerals in rocks Curiosity has been studying inside Gale Crater. \n\u201cHaving a thick CO 2 -rich atmosphere leads to some expectations about the kinds of rocks you would find deposited at that time. You would expect to see lots of carbonate minerals around, particularly in sedimentary rocks,\u201d Bristow says, \u201cbut we don\u2019t see them.\u201d \nDoes this mean there was indeed low CO 2 ? Or, that it was somehow sequestered from the lakebed Curiosity is now traversing and may be in rocks we haven\u2019t studied yet? That\u2019s an open question \u2014 but \u201cif Tom\u2019s right, I\u2019m wrong\u201d, Kite says. If there was no CO 2 , \u201cthere would be no net warming at all if you released methane into the atmosphere, because you need the CO 2 , too\u201d. \nThe true test for methane may come from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter , a European mission that arrived at Mars last fall. It will begin measuring the Martian atmosphere next spring, Kite says.

An international team led by Ernesto Palomba at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome is analysing the light reflected by them \u2013 as observed by Dawn, presently in orbit around Ceres \u2013 to identify any differences between them. \n\u201cThe bright spots are only bright relative to Ceres\u2019 already-dark surface,\u201d says Nathanial Stein , a collaborator at the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIf you saw those spots on Earth or even on [the asteroid] Vesta you would consider them to be dark spots.\u201d Advertisement \nWhile the biggest and brightest spots are in Occator crater, more exist elsewhere on the dwarf planet. \u201cAlmost all of them are associated with impact craters,\u201d says Stein. The team found 90 per cent of the bright spots are in craters or are debris ejected from a crater. \nResearchers theorise that the spots are the result of the heat of an impact melting subsurface materials, which then well up to the surface to create the bright spots. \n\u201cAs of 20 years ago we would have said that Ceres was just a big, round rock that was the same the whole way through,\u201d explains Andy Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. The jagged mountains and craters led researchers to theorise that Ceres might have an icy core with a rock-ice mantle. \nBut these spots are telling a story of a younger, more geologically active Ceres than researchers expected. That\u2019s because we would expect material ejected by impacts to mix eventually and create a uniform surface. \u201cMixing hasn\u2019t had time to occur yet, which means these spots must be young.\u201d Changing its spots \nOver time, the bright spots could be darkening as exposure to the harsh conditions of space scours their surface, or because darker material is being tossed around by subsequent impacts. \nMost of the spots are made from the same basic material as the rest of Ceres\u2019s surface: calcium or magnesium carbonates mixed with ammonia-rich clays. But a handful of the spots in the youngest craters \u2013 including the exceptionally bright spots in Occator crater \u2013 are made of sodium carbonates without nearly as much ammonium clay. \nThese are small variations, but they are enough to point to new avenues of enquiry. \n\u201cDoes this mean that there are different formation mechanisms that account for the different compositions?\u201d asks Stein, \u201cor is it just that they\u2019re end-members of the same process?\u201d The compositions of the bright spots seem similar enough that they could be explained by the impact-melt and upwelling theory, just modified by local conditions on the surface. \n\u201cCarbonates are interesting because they\u2019re made via reactions between water and minerals with carbon in them,\u201d says Rivkin. While researchers don\u2019t expect to find life on Ceres, understanding the processes that created carbonates in the bright spots will help them think about the types of reactions necessary for life to occur in such a hostile environment. \nThe next step is to build a computer model of Ceres based on everything scientists have learned about its composition, then start pelting it with simulated rocks to try to match the craters and bright spots we see there today. \u201cWe have all the information we need,\u201d says Stein. Now researchers just need to figure out how to piece it together. \nAnd after that? \u201cThese bright spots are almost certainly where you would want to send the next mission,\u201d says Rivkin, dreaming of future exploration with robotic landers or rovers on Ceres.

To explore the differences between helpful and unhelpful dolphins, Cantor and his colleagues recorded the sounds made by both types while they foraged either on their own or with people. Whistle while you fish \nSurprisingly, the whistles of cooperative dolphins were different from those of non-cooperative ones, even when foraging alone. For instance, they used fewer ascending whistles. \nDolphins from different regions often whistle differently, Cantor says, but \u201cit is much less common to find such acoustic differences among dolphins of the same population that inhabit such a small area\u201d. \nSince cooperative dolphins also whistle differently when fishing solo, the researchers don\u2019t think these calls carry specific messages about fishing with people. Instead, the whistles may be a way for dolphins to label themselves as members of a particular social group, Cantor says. Read more: Two dolphin species band together to form unprecedented alliance \nAlternatively, the dolphins may be using dialect or slang. Cantor says it is \u201cas if they speak the same language but use some \u2018expressions\u2019 that are exclusive to their social community\u201d. \nDolphins also use clicks to communicate during feeding, says Elena Papale of the Italian National Research Council. Researchers will need to examine clicks as well as whistles to better understand the dolphins\u2019 communication styles.

Advertisement \nIn 2016, Macchiarini, who held an honorary professorship at UCL, was fired from the Karolinska Institute for multiple violations. \nThe inquiry highlighted several cases of misconduct, including that involving a 36-year-old Eritrean man living in Iceland , who had a slow growing tumour in his trachea. Macchiarini made the clinical decision to remove the tumour and replace the affected segment of trachea with a synthetic graft. This graft was provided by Alexander Seifalian, who no longer works at UCL. Deep regret \nThe inquiry found that Seifalian\u2019s laboratory was not licensed to make clinical grade devices and did not request permission to use the unlicensed devices. In a written testimony to the inquiry, Macchiarini indicated that he was not aware that the graft had not been made to clinical standard. \nSeifalian welcomes the inquiry but stresses that his job was to do the basic research in the development of synthetic materials for biomedical applications. \u201cThe implantation was the job of the surgeon, who requires getting ethical approval and [regulatory] approval. This was not my job.\u201d \n\u201cWe see, time and time again, research scientists being made scapegoats for systemic problems,\u201d he adds. \u201cI am extremely proud of the excellent, innovative work we did at UCL and we continue to build on this to address global health challenges in a responsible and ethical manner.\u201d \nThe inquiry discovered other documents that suggested plastic discs manufactured at the university but not approved for human use had been sent to Mumbai, India, where they had been implanted under the skin of a patient to test that the material was biocompatible. \nAn arterial graft and a synthetic tear duct also manufactured at UCL were used in operations despite not being made to accepted quality standards. \nThe inquiry made several recommendations to the University, including reviewing their honorary appointment process, working to improve oversight for products with clinical applications, and in assisting patients who interact with researchers. \nIn a statement, UCL said: \u201cWe deeply regret that materials that had not undergone rigorous preclinical assessment and which were not made to [approved] standards, were manufactured and supplied by Professor Alexander Seifalian\u2019s research laboratory for direct clinical use.

DANI I. JESKE/De Agostini/Getty By Michael Marshall \nLife may have begun on our planet hundreds of millions of years earlier than thought, according to two studies published this week. But both papers are already proving controversial. \nBen Pearce of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and colleagues simulated conditions on early Earth to find out how readily the key molecules of life could have formed. They focused on \u201cwarm little ponds\u201d on land, which are one of the suspected sites of the origin of life \u2013 the other being deep-sea vents . \nPearce tackled the formation of RNA, a close cousin of DNA that is widely thought to have been the basis for the first life . Many of the building blocks of RNA are found in asteroids and meteoroids, so Pearce calculated how much could have been delivered to Earth by impacting rocks \u2013 of which there were plenty during Earth\u2019s first billion years \u2013 and then how much could have accumulated in ponds, given the molecules\u2019 fragility and tendency to leech away. Advertisement \nHe concluded that RNA could have formed within a handful of years of major impacts, implying that life could have formed very early in Earth\u2019s history. \nThere are two problems with this argument, says John Sutherland of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK. \nOne is that organic compounds carried in meteorites would not necessarily survive the impact . \u201cLarge impactors that would have delivered the most organic material, collide with such energy that their organic cargo is atomised,\u201d says Sutherland. In line with this, a recent study found that meteorite impacts can create temperatures of more than 2300\u00b0C . \nThe other problem is that Pearce simulated the wrong chemical process, Sutherland says. Pearce assumed that the first step in making RNA is linking together smaller molecules called nucleobases and ribose, but this \u201cwas experimentally shown not to work ages ago\u201d, says Sutherland. In 2009 Sutherland demonstrated an alternative way of making RNA from simpler building blocks ( Nature , doi.org/chvzcw ). \u201cThese authors are still assuming the old model,\u201d he says. \nA second study, published last Wednesday, claims to have identified the oldest firm evidence of life \u2013 dating back 3.95 billion years. That is only half a billion years after the Earth formed. Reliable fossils of microorganisms have been dated to roughly 3.5 billion years ago , but the evidence for older life has been less clear. \nTsuyoshi Komiya of the University of Tokyo, Japan, and colleagues studied graphite found in ancient rocks in northern Labrador, Canada. Graphite is a crystalline form of carbon used to make pencil leads. It contains two forms of carbon: carbon-12 and carbon-13. The samples Komiya looked at had relatively little carbon-13 ( Nature , doi.org/cdqn ). \nThis, the team claims, is evidence that life was present. And not just any life: organisms that were taking in carbon from their surroundings and using it as raw material to make new organic compounds. Such organisms are known as \u201cautotrophs\u201d and today they include all green plants, which manufacture sugar from carbon dioxide and water. These early autotrophs would have been single-celled organisms and they probably used a different chemical process, but the idea is the same. Autotrophs prefer to use carbon-12, so their remains tend to have very little carbon-13. \nThis result is surprising for several reasons. First, at this time, Earth was being bombarded by large rocks from space , which would have battered the young planet\u2019s surface. If life was present, it must have been impressively resilient. \nBut only if Komiya\u2019s study is correct. His only evidence for the existence of life is the unusual ratio of carbon isotopes, and this may not be definitive. \u201cThere are many ways in which abiotic processes can produce such an imbalance, so to conclude that it is evidence for life is simply not justified,\u201d says Sutherland. \nSutherland says a set of chemical reactions known as the Fischer-Tropsch process could be responsible. This process makes organic compounds from hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and show a similar bias towards carbon-12. It is known to occur naturally, for instance in meteorites . \nKomiya\u2019s team assumed these reactions were not responsible for their results, on the grounds that there cannot have been hydrogen in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. But Sutherland says there could well have been. If there was water and carbon monoxide in the air, and hot iron from meteorite impacts to act as a catalyst , \u201chydrogen can easily be generated\u201d. \nNevertheless, evidence is mounting that life was present earlier than 3.5 billion years ago. For instance, in 2016 fossilised stromatolites \u2013 layered mounds made by microbes living in sediments \u2013 were controversially claimed to have been found in 3.7-billion-year-old rocks . Then in March 2017, researchers described apparent fossilised microbes from rocks that were 3.77 to 4.28 billion years old ( Nature , doi.org/f9s5gw ).

Elmehed. \u00a9 Nobel Media 2017 By Andy Coghlan \nJust two years after their discovery, gravitational waves have earned a Nobel prize for Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne, the three leaders of the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration that found the waves on 14 September 2015. The discovery, which was announced publicly in 2016 , confirmed predictions made 100 years ago by Albert Einstein. \nHalf of the $1.1 million prize went to Weiss, the remainder shared between Barish and Thorne. \u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful, but I view this more as recognition of around 1000 people who contributed and a result of dedicated efforts over 40 years,\u201d said Weiss, reacting to the announcement. \n\u201cThe discovery, the first ever observation of gravity waves, is a milestone opening a new window into the universe,\u201d said Olga Botner of Uppsala University in Sweden, and a member of the Nobel committee for Physics that awarded the prize. \u201cEinstein was obviously right again, and the prize goes to the leaders of the international team for the discovery that shook the world.\u201d Advertisement Read more: Gravitational waves could show hints of extra dimensions \nBotner, co-announcing the award by the Swedish Academy of Sciences, explained that the waves originated 1.3 billion years ago, from the collision between two distant black holes. \nThey were detected within 69 milliseconds apart at LIGO\u2019s major detectors. The first trace at Hanford, Washington state, matched almost exactly the second at Livingston, Louisiana, 3000 kilometres away. Their perfect overlap allowed the team to rule out a false signal, said Botner. Laser discovery \nLIGO used a pair of laser interferometers to measure a change thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus as the wave passed through the Earth. \u201cThe detectors are amazingly sensitive,\u201d said Botner. \nWeiss\u2019s major contribution back in the 1970s at MIT was to find ways of cancelling out sources of background noise that could be mistaken for gravitational waves. \u201cA passing truck or waves lapping against the ocean shore had to be excluded,\u201d said Botner. Weiss pioneered ingenious ways of suspending mirrors that would capture the tiny movements caused by gravitational waves without any worldly disturbances. \nThorne, based at Caltech in Los Angeles, joined forces with Weiss to develop the interferometer itself, in collaboration with Scottish scientist, Ronald Drever, who passed away in March this year. \nBarish took over the reins in 1994 as leader of LIGO and transformed what was a small research group of 40 into a major international collaboration of 1000 scientists . \nResponding to the announcement today, Weiss said that the discovery would open new windows on sources of gravitational waves in the Universe. \u201cWe know about black holes and neutron stars, but we hope there are other phenomena we can see because of the gravitational waves they emit,\u201d he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barry barish", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rainer weiss", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kip thorne n.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "einstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "botner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald drever", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kip thorne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thorne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy coghlan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert einstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olga botner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "swedish academy of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uppsala university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ligo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caltech", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "livingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:17:05.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a168916f17969b46a8a87c99866ce021a81cf6d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLatuGSZK5YyOTTvIGkxBiqgb0fvoUIIMIW_RXxDFX5mqCDf05nTwzHQl3aIHH6eHhUbyg.OpsJIkA1joj2ElIt9DULd3pO2vTTg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/solar-system", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Grass-fed beef is bad for the planet and causes climate change", "title_full": "Grass-fed beef is bad for the planet and causes climate change", "published": "2017-10-03T14:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/03105635/rexfeatures_4816730a_new.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a168916f17969b46a8a87c99866ce021a81cf6d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLatuGSZK5YyOTTvIGkxBiqgb0fvoUIIMIW_RXxDFX5mqCDf05nTwzHQl3aIHH6eHhUbyg.OpsJIkA1joj2ElIt9DULd3pO2vTTg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Grass-fed beef is bad for the planet and causes climate change", "text": "Grass-fed beef is bad for the planet and causes climate change Still a problematic part of the menu FLPA/John Eveson/REX/Shutterstock By Fred Pearce \nPrince Charles is wrong to support grass-fed beef. The idea that beef from cows raised on bucolic pastures is good for the environment, and that we can therefore eat as much meat as we want, doesn\u2019t add up. New calculations suggest cattle pastures contribute to climate change. \n\u201cSadly, though it would be nice if the pro-grazers were right, they aren\u2019t,\u201d says lead author Tara Garnett of the University of Oxford\u2019s Food Climate Research Network. \u201cThe truth is, we cannot eat as much meat as we like and save the planet.\u201d \nMany meat eaters have long felt guilty that the beef steaks they love are bringing environmental disaster. Advertisement \nA key problem is that microorganisms in the guts of cattle emit millions of tonnes of methane every year. A typical cow releases 100 kilograms of methane a year and the world has about a billion of them. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, this exacerbates global warming. \nMeanwhile, feeding the beasts destroys forests by taking land for pasture or to grow feed \u2013 and this deforestation also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions . \nBut a counter-view has gained currency. First popularised by Zimbabwean ecologist and livestock farmer Allan Savory , and supported by organic farmers like Prince Charles , it argues that grazing cattle on pastures is actually good for the climate. \nThe idea is that plants on pastures capture carbon from the air, especially when fertilised by manure. Pastures should also reduce our need for food crops grown on land that releases carbon when ploughed. Doing the sums \nConfused by conflicting claims, Garnett and her colleagues calculated the flow of greenhouse gases into and out of pastures. She found that \u201cin some circumstances, you can get carbon capture, but not always and the effect is small. You cannot extrapolate from a nicely run Dorset farm to a global food strategy.\u201d \nAt best, carbon capture only offsets 20 to 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from grazing, mostly the methane from cattle. \u201cAnd the carbon capture stops after a few decades,\u201d says Garnett, when the carbon-enriched soils reach equilibrium with the air. \u201cMeanwhile, the cattle continue to belch methane.\u201d \nHer findings are published in a report, Grazed and Confused? \nThe analysis is more comprehensive than past studies, says Tim Benton at the University of Leeds, UK. \u201cIt asks, if we are to eat meat, is there a better way to grow it? The answer is: not really.\u201d Less meat \nSupporters of cattle grazing aren\u2019t giving up just yet, though. Some say cattle have simply replaced wild ruminants, which also release methane. But Garnett points out that many cattle, especially in the tropics, graze on former forest land. In places such as the Brazilian Amazon, clearing trees for cattle causes massive greenhouse gas emissions. \nAt low densities of around one animal per hectare, carbon capture in soils could still exceed methane emissions, says Richard Young of the Sustainable Food Trust in Bristol, UK, which supports cattle grazing. However, he concedes that this isn\u2019t true at higher densities. \nGarnett\u2019s conclusion is supported by a study published on 29 September, which found that methane emissions from cattle are 11 per cent larger than older methods would suggest, and thus a bigger contributor to global warming ( Carbon Balance and Management, doi.org/cdpz ). \n\u201cWe need to reduce emissions from livestock,\u201d says Benton. \u201cThat needs to come from dietary change.\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "garnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim benton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince charles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allan savory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred pearce  prince charles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tara garnett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of leeds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sustainable food trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford\u2019s food climate research network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dorset", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:59:37.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d4f0b4fd20df34db1458521caaed5a6ee1cbb1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLamt2rTbPJa3qlEj7E7hegGG2GOJyE1XK2rEfuA5C_J_29qwiYXW3Y1nFjQEr5PJ9XOL_gmYY1npOueBaSxXifCji8GNLX6VJgA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Build an AI god?

Macchiarini made the clinical decision to remove the tumour and replace the affected segment of trachea with a synthetic graft. This graft was provided by Alexander Seifalian, who no longer works at UCL.

Elmehed. \u00a9 Nobel Media 2017 By Clare Wilson \nThe discovery of a way to see complex biological molecules in atomic resolution has won this year\u2019s Nobel prize in Chemistry. The award has gone to Richard Henderson, Jacques Dubochet and Joachim Frank for developing cryo-electron microscopy, which cools down substances to liquid nitrogen temperatures. \nTheir techniques have recently let us see in unprecedented detail the surface of the Zika virus, bacterial proteins that cause antibiotic resistance, and tumour cell proteins that let cancers become resistant to chemotherapy. \nPrevious electron microscopes were less useful, partly because they need the sample to be placed in a vacuum. This causes surrounding water to evaporate, and the molecules being studied collapse and lose their normal structure. Electron microscopes were also too damaging, because they work by firing a beam of electrons at the sample. Advertisement \nRichard Henderson of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, found a way to protect biomolecules by coating their surface with a glucose solution that stopped it from drying out in the vacuum. In 1975 his team produced the best picture of a protein ever made with an electron microscope, with their imaging of a bacterial molecule called bacteriorhodopsin, showing how it crossed the cell membrane seven times. \nJoachim Frank of Columbia University in New York developed an image-processing method that merges many two-dimensional images of a biomolecules to create a sharp three-dimensional picture. \nAnd Jacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland developed a technique for vitrifying water \u2013 cooling it down so quickly that it solidifies in liquid form around the biomolecule, so it keeps its normal shape, even in a vacuum. \nTogether the work of all three led to a burgeoning new field. At first the images produced, though useful, were somewhat shapeless \u2013 leading cryo-electron microscopy to be dubbed \u201cblobology\u201d. But numerous refinements over the years has made the resulting images sharper than ever, producing a stream of new discoveries about life\u2019s most complex and intricate machinary. \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joachim frank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jacques dubochet", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "richard henderson n. elmehed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clare wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard henderson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of lausanne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medical research council laboratory of molecular biology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T14:16:09.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b196c268dd3cf9afbd5c07c7dab0f05b03e06b21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_vBYbGbNk_OWWFbqL05JyClLFg7rHMwsB3Z1xhSpQQG2.Z170vRvz3YYoRsqjk9Hc0QK6tlD3Eb", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/comets-asteroids", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "How scaremongering stops us asking the right questions about AI", "title_full": "How scaremongering stops us asking the right questions about AI", "published": "2017-10-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04180000/ai_robotwars_main.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b196c268dd3cf9afbd5c07c7dab0f05b03e06b21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_vBYbGbNk_OWWFbqL05JyClLFg7rHMwsB3Z1xhSpQQG2.Z170vRvz3YYoRsqjk9Hc0QK6tlD3Eb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How scaremongering stops us asking the right questions about AI", "text": "4 October 2017 How scaremongering stops us asking the right questions about AI We worry it\u2019s going to steal our jobs \u2013 or even destroy humanity itself.

Lepp/Corbis/Getty By Chris Baraniuk \nThere are always better restaurants in the city, and that could be making the town mice of New York genetically distinct from their country cousins. \nStephen Harris at the State University of New York and Jason Munshi-South of Fordham University in New York City caught 48 white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) from three New York parks and three nearby rural areas. The mice are native to this part of North America, so the pair wanted to find out whether some had begun to evolve for city living. \nThey examined the mice\u2019s RNA to see if the rural and urban populations expressed different genes. Ultimately, they homed in on 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): places in the genome where a single letter varies from mouse to mouse. Advertisement \nSeveral SNPs were in genes associated with digestion and other metabolic processes. One highlighted gene was used to produce omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. A version of this gene appears to have been selected for in humans as we moved from hunter-gathering to agriculture. \nThe work is \u201cat the forefront of biology\u201d, says Jonathan Richardson at Providence College in Rhode Island. The cheeseburger hypothesis \nThe survey also highlighted genes linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which may result from having to process a lot of fatty acids. This could be due to a diet rich in fast foods. \u201cThe first thing that we thought of was the \u2018cheeseburger hypothesis\u2019: urban mice subsidising their diet on human food waste,\u201d says Harris. If so, the mice may be like \u201cPizza Rat\u201d, a New York rodent videoed carrying a whole slice of pizza. \nIn line with this, city mice had larger livers with more scar tissue, says Harris, who was at the City University of New York when most of the work was done. However, the sample size was too small to be sure. \nBesides, New York offers other foods, like seeds, nuts and berries in its parks. Such resources are more plentiful than in rural areas, where there is more competition from other species. \nThe mice may be enjoying an eclectic mix of urban food resources, says Richardson, occasionally boosting their calorie intake by dining on human food waste. \nThe next step will be to examine the function of these genes more closely to assess their impact on fitness and selection, says Hopi Hoekstra at Harvard University. \nHoekstra says the work is part of a wave of studies investigating examples of rapid adaptation. \u201cThat provides us with a really cool way to study evolutionary change, sort of as it\u2019s happening,\u201d she says.

A road map will be launched today that describes how the partners plan to cut deaths from the water-borne bacteria \u2013 now running at 95,000 a year \u2013 by 90 per cent by 2030 . \nThat will mean eliminating cholera from 20 of the 47 countries that have it, and enabling the rest to detect and stop outbreaks before they get out of control, according to this Global Task Force on Cholera Control. \nThe challenge is daunting. Three million people get cholera every year, in Asia, Africa and Haiti, and increasing urbanisation and temperatures will put more people at risk.

Rich countries banished it a century ago, not with vaccines, but with toilets and hygiene. Falling funding \nIn poor countries, 2 billion people drink from water sources contaminated with faeces and 2.4 billion have no toilets, according to the WHO. Yet aid from rich countries to build sewage systems has fallen. \nThe WHO says spending on sanitation must prioritise \u201chotspots\u201d where cholera lurks all the time. Spending on cholera goes mostly to contain outbreaks in new places, leaving hotspots as continued sources of disease. \nThe task force\u2019s road map calls for coordinated investments \u2013 and for deployment of the real game changer, an oral cholera vaccine that has proved over the past few years that it can quickly contain outbreaks. Nearly a million doses are already en route for Bangladesh. \n\u201cThis disease doesn\u2019t deserve to be in this century,\u201d says Seth Berkley , head of the vaccine agency Gavi in Geneva. \u201cWe can make this a reality.\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "seth berkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter salama", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty by debora mackenzie  the world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "haiti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T15:31:46.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a1aed0c5fc19605fdb38888e869a1ba03fde179", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo7y.uyMPCA4BYkPdVMOUxGsf96tdL1RdVHe0e8YiFLSdRaGyJtplLR0FcSDBfDjbqWphqO4nTdN746NNZHk1DsIIDEwWqQZETQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "We\u2019ve finally seen how the sleeping brain stores memories", "title_full": "We\u2019ve finally seen how the sleeping brain stores memories", "published": "2017-10-04T18:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04141000/z220_168_new.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a1aed0c5fc19605fdb38888e869a1ba03fde179", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo7y.uyMPCA4BYkPdVMOUxGsf96tdL1RdVHe0e8YiFLSdRaGyJtplLR0FcSDBfDjbqWphqO4nTdN746NNZHk1DsIIDEwWqQZETQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T18:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "We\u2019ve finally seen how the sleeping brain stores memories", "text": "We\u2019ve finally seen how the sleeping brain stores memories Rest well to remember Elke Meitzel/Millennium Images, UK By Jessica Hamzelou \nAT LAST, we\u2019ve seen how the brain memories when we sleep.

It is the first time memories have been observed being filed away in humans during sleep, he says. \nVahdat and his colleagues did this by finding people who were able to fall asleep in the confined, noisy space of an fMRI scanner, which is no easy undertaking. \u201cWe screened more than 50 people in a mock scanner, and only 13 made it through to the study,\u201d says Vahdat. Advertisement \nThe team then taught this group of volunteers to press a set of keys in a specific sequence \u2013 in the same way that a pianist might learn to play a tune. It took each person between about 10 and 20 minutes to master a sequence involving five presses. \u201cThey had to learn to play it as quickly and as accurately as possible,\u201d says Vahdat. \nOnce they had learned the sequence, each volunteer put on a cap of EEG electrodes to monitor the electrical activity of their brain, and entered an fMRI scanner \u2013 which detects which regions of the brain are active. \nThe team saw a specific pattern of brain activity while the volunteers performed the key-pressing task. Once they had stopped, this pattern kept replaying, as if each person was subconsciously revising what they had learned. \nThe volunteers were then asked to go to sleep, while the team monitored each of them for two-and-a-half hours. At first, the pattern of brain activity continued to replay in the outer region of the brain called the cortex, which is involved in higher thought. \nWhen the volunteers entered non-REM sleep \u2013 known as the stage when we have relatively mundane dreams \u2013 the pattern started to fade in the cortex, but a similar pattern of activity started in the putamen, a region deep within the brain ( eLife , doi.org/cdsz ). \u201cThe memory trace evolved during sleep,\u201d says Vahdat. \nHis team thinks that movement-related memories are transferred to deeper brain regions for long-term storage. This chimes with the hypothesis that the brain\u2019s cortex must free up space so that it can continue to learn new information, says Christoph Nissen at University Psychiatric Services in Bern, Switzerland. \nNon-REM sleep happens within a few hours of dozing off, says Vahdat. If you\u2019re hoping for some night-time learning, it\u2019s important to make sure that those first few hours are uninterrupted , he says. \nNissen hopes a better understanding of how memories are consolidated during sleep could lead to treatments for people with insomnia and similar sleep disorders. Such individuals tend to be treated with drugs that send them to sleep, but Nissen has found that this sleep doesn\u2019t seem to be as good at consolidating memories as natural sleep. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cHow our sleeping brain stores away memories\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elke meitzel/millenn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vahdat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nissen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica hamzelou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shahab vahdat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christoph nissen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stanford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university psychiatric services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T18:26:55.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ea5b48b50b9cc97c9e21ff5fb0cd81fe4ab1d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaprq8LYPcarJZdXI5PNtMRX9cTVqI9w2UjKvVEnTAkXBDbeVgamG_pDHcmuOOzMjGOlFzW1zpzwLqy85zX9ObO_eN_23JclEYg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/essays", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Phone calls can be beamed right into your central nervous system", "title_full": "Phone calls can be beamed right into your central nervous system", "published": "2017-10-04T19:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04150654/60_year_old-female_cards_1_cmyk1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ea5b48b50b9cc97c9e21ff5fb0cd81fe4ab1d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaprq8LYPcarJZdXI5PNtMRX9cTVqI9w2UjKvVEnTAkXBDbeVgamG_pDHcmuOOzMjGOlFzW1zpzwLqy85zX9ObO_eN_23JclEYg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T19:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Phone calls can be beamed right into your central nervous system", "text": "Phone calls can be beamed right into your central nervous system Direct to brain communication Edelman By Frank Swain \nJust what you need in the age of ubiquitous surveillance: the latest cochlear implants will allow users stream audio directly from their iPhone into their cochlear nerve. Apple and implant manufacturer Cochlear have made \u201cMade for iPhone\u201d connectivity available for any hearing implants that use the next-generation Nucleus 7 sound processor. The advance means that these implants can also stream music and Netflix shows. \nThe technology was first unveiled in 2014 when it was added to hearing aids such as the Starkey Halo and ReSound LiNX. But this is the first time it\u2019s been linked into the central nervous system. \nWhile some cochlear implants already offer Bluetooth connectivity, these often require users to wear extra dongles or other intermediary devices to pick up digital signals, and then rebroadcast them to the hearing aid as radio. This technology simply beams the signal right into the brain. Advertisement \nIt\u2019s also a better way to use Bluetooth. Bluetooth headsets have been commonplace since the early 2000s, but the energy-sapping technology has meant they are typically clunky devices with poor battery life. \nIn 2014, Apple technicians developed a way to stream audio over the low energy Bluetooth format used by wearables such as FitBits. Now, tiny devices like hearing aids \u2013 and Apple\u2019s Airpods \u2014 can stream audio signals for up to a week on a battery the size of an aspirin. \nThere is a small cost \u2013 the audio signal is highly compressed, and can sound much flatter than sounds from typical Bluetooth headsets. That\u2019s unlikely to be a problem for cochlear implant users, as these devices can only stimulate a limited number of frequencies in the ear anyway \u2014 because of this low sound quality, cochlear implants are reserved for those with profound hearing loss . \nHowever, the technology behind the new audio streaming models is likely to be adopted by consumer audio devices. Technology giants are betting heavily on audio interfaces becoming the norm in the future , all the better to further integrate voice-activated assistants such as Siri, OK Google, Cortana and Alexa into our daily routines. \nIt\u2019s likely that in the future most of us will wear discreet, \u201ctransparent\u201d ear buds that allow us to hear the world around us while also allowing us to field calls, texts, emails, and hear updates and directions directly from our phone . \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "edelm", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "frank swain  just", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cortana", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "starkey halo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T19:23:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a65884319f7b14a0f40bf41d62c6d106f3a936b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo7y.uyMPCA4BnNk_DFZEuTzvRvQASCnLSP1.so5Gd_RY37qElMuNePSf5gRCB7opUqrR8_9lxkBKLinmk5z.r8_RjTndM7h7gxPzbIWeiMQE", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/exploring-mars", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Our braininess may have evolved thanks to less sticky neurons", "title_full": "Our braininess may have evolved thanks to less sticky neurons", "published": "2017-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04150000/gettyimages-548000055_new.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a65884319f7b14a0f40bf41d62c6d106f3a936b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo7y.uyMPCA4BnNk_DFZEuTzvRvQASCnLSP1.so5Gd_RY37qElMuNePSf5gRCB7opUqrR8_9lxkBKLinmk5z.r8_RjTndM7h7gxPzbIWeiMQE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Our braininess may have evolved thanks to less sticky neurons", "text": "Our braininess may have evolved thanks to less sticky neurons Non-stick brain Zephyr/Science Photo Library By Clare Wilson \nOUR braininess may have evolved thanks to gene changes that made our brain cells less sticky. \nThe cortex is the thin, highly folded outer layer of our brains and it is home to some of our most sophisticated mental abilities, such as planning, language and complex thoughts. \nAround three millimetres thick, this layer is folded into an intricate pattern of ridges and valleys, which allows the cortex to be large, but still fit into a relatively small space. Many larger mammals, such as primates, dolphins and horses, have various patterns of folds in their cortex, but folds are rarer in smaller animals like mice. Advertisement \nSo far, we have only identified a few genetic mutations that contributed to the evolution of the human brain, including ones that boosted the number of cells in the cortex. One theory about how the cortex came to be folded is that it buckled as the layer of cells expanded . \nDaniel del Toro at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Munich, Germany, and colleagues wondered if some of the genetic changes in our brain\u2019s evolution might have been about more than just an increasing number of cells. They investigated the genes for two molecules \u2013 FLRT1 and FLRT3 \u2013 which make developing brain cells stick to each other more. \u201cIf brain cells are less sticky, they may form more complex structures within the cortex\u201d \nHuman brain cells produce only a small amount of these compounds, while mice brain cells make lots. Del Toro\u2019s team created mice embryos that lacked functioning FLRT1 and FLRT3 genes, which meant their cortex cells were only loosely attached to each other, like those of humans. \nWhen the genetically altered mice were born and grew into adults, they had more folded brains. This finding was presented at the Cortex Evolution and Development conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, last month. But it is still unclear if these mice are smarter \u2013 that is what the team plans to study next. \nWhy would less sticky brain cells lead to a folded cortex? As a human fetus develops, new brain cells are produced in the middle of the head, and then move outwards until they reach the surface and become the cortex. Del Toro speculates that the stickier cells in normal mice might make the cortex layer too rigid to deform into wrinkles. \u201cImagine a line of people running together holding hands,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end, they all arrive at the same time.\u201d \nThe looser bonding of human brain cells might also allow them to migrate at different speeds and so form more complex structures within the cortex, says del Toro. \nBut it is too soon to conclude that this was a key change in our evolutionary history, says Todd Preuss at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University, Georgia, because the study only compared humans and mice. \u201cIt would be interesting to see what these genes are doing in other primates and mammals.\u201d \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cHow we got our folded brains?\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "todd preuss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "del toro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clare wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel del toro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yerkes national primate research center of emory university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max planck institute of neurobiology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "copenhagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T19:35:09.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "736787ad18a8bc800156956275ca9db02271ec22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLarpeScQjBtKZIvGrJfR1iJWturCtDV.xKmGOujzkE.WEOpAxcAwcGKv5lpqBeb8R.cD7X.d4eujaEFRdEaIZf88jG3psWr2fqQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/energy-fuels", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "The US will not ban guns so must learn how to live with them", "title_full": "The US will not ban guns so must learn how to live with them", "published": "2017-10-04T19:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04164617/gettyimages-91474106.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "736787ad18a8bc800156956275ca9db02271ec22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLarpeScQjBtKZIvGrJfR1iJWturCtDV.xKmGOujzkE.WEOpAxcAwcGKv5lpqBeb8R.cD7X.d4eujaEFRdEaIZf88jG3psWr2fqQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T19:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "The US will not ban guns so must learn how to live with them", "text": "4 October 2017 The US will not ban guns so must learn how to live with them The political reality is that the US will never be rid of its weapons.

So say scientists who have analysed sediment from the South China Sea \u2013 but not everyone is convinced. \nSeveral early civilisations hit a crisis point about 4000 years ago . The global climate cooled, and this has been linked to the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in ancient Mesopotamia, the end of the Indus valley civilisation of South Asia and the fall of the Liangzhu culture in what is now eastern China. \nCooling was also felt on Hainan island off China\u2019s southern coast, according to Fangjian Xu at the China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, Bangqi Hu at the Qingdao Institute of Marine Geology, and their colleagues. The cooling led to an increase in heavy metal pollution in the South China Sea. Advertisement \nXu and his colleagues looked at two sediment cores from just south-east of Hainan. They calculated \u201cenrichment factors\u201d for several metals. A value of 1 or below indicates no enrichment, while values between 1 and 3 suggest \u201cminor enrichment\u201d . Farms not fish \nThe enrichment factors of cadmium and lead hovered around 1 before the 4000-year mark, but afterwards increased to about 1.5. In other words, human activity on Hainan 4000 years ago led to a subtle but detectable uptick in heavy metal pollution in the South China Sea, says the team. \nThe group suggests that the change was linked to the global cooling at the time, when Hainan would have cooled and dried. Lower monsoon activity would have triggered a reduction in coastal upwelling, lowering marine productivity and encouraging Hainan\u2019s inhabitants to focus on farming rather than fishing. \nRun-off into the sea from farms would have included heavy metals, which were accumulating in soil because of the use of metal tools. \nSamuel Toucanne at the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea in Plouzan\u00e9 was involved in a 2015 analysis of South China Sea sediment from further west , derived from the Red River that runs through China and Vietnam. There, the evidence of human-related pollution from lead, copper and arsenic began only 1800 years ago. Questionable link \nToucanne says the uptick in pollution 4000 years ago is gradual rather than clear-cut. \u201cBut they use this precise age to discuss global climate and the relationship with human activities,\u201d he says. It is questionable whether there is a direct link between the climate cooling 4000 years ago and the increase in pollution off Hainan. \nThere is also evidence of increased precipitation on some parts of Hainan in response to the climate change , says James Innes at Durham University, UK. \u201cSo increased aridity at Hainan around this time isn\u2019t for certain.\u201d \nStill, Innes thinks the proposed scenario is plausible. \u201cDeclining productivity offshore could have led to increased agriculture on Hainan island,\u201d he says. \nHowever, Peter Clift at Louisiana State University is unconvinced. He says other evidence suggests pollution from metalworking on the mainland only began to affect the South China Sea about 2000 years ago . \u201cI find it difficult to believe that little Hainan island was much more developed 4000 years ago.\u201d \nHowever, there is precedent for significant pollution that long ago.

We are used to getting lots of warning before an earthquake \u2013 and this time, we didn\u2019t. \nSince 1993, Mexico City has had a fully operational earthquake early warning system. When a magnitude 8.1 quake struck on 8 September, the city got over a minute of warning. \nBut 19 September\u2019s quake showed that the system can\u2019t handle all types of events. The limited warning it gave holds lessons for all countries working to give their citizens a head start. Advertisement \n\u201cThis event in Mexico City is critical,\u201d says Richard Allen at the University of California, Berkeley. \nMexico\u2019s warning system was born after a 1985 earthquake that levelled parts of the city and claimed thousands of lives. Mexico\u2019s unique quakes meant the system was particularly viable. \nThe quakes are generated by two continental plates that meet along much of Mexico\u2019s west coast. Mexico City lies hundreds of kilometres away, so it ought to be safe. But the city was built on a loose lakebed topped with looser landfill. This soil picks up tremors from far away. In 1985, shifting soil went on toppling buildings long after the quake had petered out. \nHowever, with such a long distance between the epicentre and the city, scientists could create a warning system. Today, a 1985-style quake on the coast will trigger alarms in Mexico City 60 to 90 seconds before it arrives. \n\u201cIf you have minutes, you can empty any school practically anywhere,\u201d says Gerardo Suarez at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. \nBut the warning on 19 September was more like 0 to 5 seconds. That\u2019s because the quake began elsewhere in the plate boundary, deeper and closer to the city. It was more the sort of tremor that could strike California. \u201cIn my house, the warning arrived at the same time as the first shocks. Others slipped down the stairwell\u201d \nFor decades, Allen pushed California to build a warning system. In 2014, he got federal funding and in 2018 a prototype will start issuing limited alerts. Unlike Mexico\u2019s system, it will only give about 10 seconds of warning. \nThere are many pitfalls. What if it gives too many false alarms, so people ignore them and are caught out by quakes? What if the system misses the big one? And what if 10 seconds just isn\u2019t enough time? Understanding what Mexicans did in such a short window might help the US. \nIt won\u2019t be easy. In my house, the warning arrived at the same time as the first shocks. Others say they ended up in a pile of people slipping and falling down the stairwell. \n\u201cWhat are you going to do with a 5, 8, 10-second warning?\u201d Suarez wonders. His wife was able to leave the store she was shopping in and get to the street, but she was lucky. He says most people won\u2019t be able to do much except duck under their desks. \nHowever, even if people cannot do much in mere seconds, computers can do plenty. Suarez says many responses could be automated. Computers could halt trains, stop elevators at the next floor and warn surgeons. He also suggests broadcasting a countdown so people know how long they have. \nThere are limits to warning systems. A recent study found no way to tell if a brewing quake will be huge until it\u2019s too late (Science, doi.org/cdd6 ). So it will always be a matter of seconds. The trick will be to make the best use of those seconds to save lives. \n\u201cI personally believe that no children should die below the rubble of their own school,\u201d Suarez says. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cEven a few seconds\u2019 warning can save lives\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alejan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "richard allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suarez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerardo suarez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik vance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of california, berkeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national autonomous university of mexico", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico city 60", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T21:14:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41b62e1711604050d8a99806473084e5bd4afea4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_yUDNQThcAv6W_lqoyAnNzBqtvkNgnPO0X0FzqOHcX72OHPPROJDSd_dFWuLaBcqjYbHPyNgNIE72fZ6yAGNTuwycDUUPySc4dVFXodjzy_", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/60-seconds", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "DNA testing firms are cashing in our genes.

What if your accountant likes to go base jumping at the weekend \u2013 might she be more likely to take risks with your money than someone who relaxes by playing golf instead? \nThe answer to both seems to be yes. The most comprehensive study yet into how people respond to risk has found there is a common component that drives all types of risk-taking. \nHow eager we are to engage in risky activities is known as our risk preference. Psychologists consider this a key component of human behaviour because its impact on our decision-making has consequences \u2013 often dramatic ones \u2013 for so many aspects of our lives. Advertisement \nDespite its importance, there is a lack of consensus over whether people\u2019s tendency to take risks is consistent or whether it varies depending on the type of risk. To find out, Renato Frey at the University of Basel in Switzerland and his colleagues asked 1500 adults to complete 39 tests commonly used to measure risk preference in different scenarios. \nControlling for age and gender, they found that 61 per cent of the variation in an individual\u2019s scores across the tests could be explained by a single component, with the rest of the variation explained by factors specific to the different types of risk. G whizz \nThis is similar to how we understand intelligence. Because people who excel at one cognitive test tend to do so on them all, psychologists often talk about a general factor of intelligence , known as g, to explain this across-the-board performance. If you have a high g score, you are likely to do well on any type of cognitive test. But how well you do on any one test will also depend on other factors, such as you possessing abilities that are helpful for that specific test. \nFrey and his team\u2019s results suggest that people\u2019s risk preference scores can be explained by both a general component they call R, and seven specific components that relate to different types of risk. The general component could be driven by mechanisms such as a person\u2019s risk perception, their genetic disposition or level of understanding of risk \u2013 common factors that would apply no matter what the situation. \nSpecific factors such as recreational risk-taking could be explained by things like an individual\u2019s desire for thrilling experiences, or problems with disinhibition could underlie risky health behaviours such as smoking or drinking to excess. \nThe existence of the general component, plus the finding that people\u2019s R value was fairly consistent when the team retested participants after six months, suggests that risk preference should be considered an enduring psychological trait like intelligence, says Frey. \n\u201cRisk preference seems to have a core, stable component, like other personality traits, and is not something which is entirely \u2018created\u2019 in the moment as a function of external stimuli, the context or the environment,\u201d says Matteo Galizzi at the London School of Economics. \nThis means we could start to explore the biological foundations of risky behaviour and use it to help people. \u201cIf you could identify someone from their genes or neural anatomy who was likely to be highly prone to taking risks in adolescence or later in life, you could teach that person to be aware of risks and the potential dangers involved,\u201d says Frey.

Just like physical exercise, the kind of improvements you get depends on exactly how you train \u2013 and most of us are doing it all wrong. \nThat the brain changes physically when we learn a new skill, like juggling or playing a musical instrument, has been known for over a decade. Previous studies had suggested that meditation does something similar for parts of the brain involved in focused attention. \nTwo new studies published in Science Advances suggest that certain kinds of meditation can change social and emotional circuitry, too. The research comes out of the ReSource Project at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, and looked at the effects of three different meditation techniques on the brains and bodies of more than 300 volunteers over 9 months. Advertisement \nOne technique was based on mindfulness meditation , and taught people to direct attention to the breath or body. A second type concentrated on compassion and emotional connection via loving kindness meditations and non-judgmental problem-sharing sessions with a partner. A final method encouraged people to think about issues from different points of view, also via a mix of partnered sessions and solo meditation. \nIn one study , MRI scans taken after each three-month course showed that parts of the cortex involved in the specific skill that was trained grew thicker in comparison with scans from a control group. \nMindfulness meditation increased thickness in the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobes, both linked to attention control, while compassion-based meditation showed increases in the limbic system, which processes emotions, and the anterior insula, which helps bring emotions into conscious awareness. Perspective-taking training boosted regions involved in theory of mind . \nAll of the brain changes were matched by improvements in tests of the relevant skills. Just like exercise \nTania Singer, a social neuroscientist and the lead researcher on the study, says that meditation courses should be better designed for specific outcomes, just as exercise programmes might target certain physical weaknesses. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking a sport expert \u2018what does sport do to your body\u2019. The expert would say, do you mean swimming or horse-riding? You can imagine mental training being as complex,\u201d she says. \nRoi Cohen Kadosh, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, thinks the findings are potentially important. \u201cWe still have to see how it affects everyday life. But if there are changes in real life, that could be pretty significant,\u201d he says. He also points out that all the volunteers first did mindfulness meditation, so it is an open question is whether any change depends on first having done some attention training. But, he says, \u201cit\u2019s progress\u201d. \nA second study looked at meditation\u2019s impact on stress levels in the same volunteers. Many studies have reported that meditation makes people feel calmer, but the effects on levels of the stress hormone cortisol have been mixed. The problem could be that meditation tends to be a solo activity. \nThe researchers found that mindfulness meditation alone made the volunteers feel calmer when asked to give a presentation at short notice, but their cortisol levels were no different from those in controls. \nAfter engaging in face-to-face sessions with a partner in addition to compassion or perspective-based meditation, however, volunteers showed up to a 51 per cent drop in cortisol levels compared with controls. \nSinger says this is important because most of the stress that we experience in modern life is social stress: the fear of being judged harshly or falling short of expectations. This kind of stress is linked to mental health problems and disease, and the new findings suggest that mindfulness meditation alone may not save us from it. \nWhen it does work, Singer says, it\u2019s probably down to the social aspect of attending a meditation group rather than the practice itself. \u201cIt\u2019s not just getting calm [that\u2019s responsible],\u201d she says.

Read on to discover how to take control of your wandering mind, and other simple ways to stay sharp when deadlines are looming. 1. Give your mind more to do \nGive your mind more to do: Research by Nilli Lavie at University College London has found that adding deliberate distractions \u2013 a jazzy border on a page or a bit of background noise \u2013 actually reduces distractibility . Her \u201cload theory\u201d proposes this works because attention is a limited resource, so if you fill all the attentional \u201cslots\u201d in your mind, it leaves no room for other distractions. 2. Bribe yourself \nThe prospect of a treat can keep people focused , but only when it is well-timed, studies show. Offering people small rewards throughout a boring task didn\u2019t stop them from losing focus, but the promise of a larger reward that they would receive at the end of the task kept them alert. This approach probably works best with an accomplice to keep you from caving early, says Michael Esterman , at the Boston Attention and Learning Laboratory, who did the research. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fool yourself.\u201d Daydreaming need not be the enemy of focus. Learn to do it right and you could reap the benefits from more successful revision to more motivation 3. Test yourself \nWe\u2019re currently finding that there\u2019s more than one way your mind can wander, and that knowing how to navigate your daydreams could save you come exam time. One trick is to make sure your mind is wandering about the stuff you need to learn . To do that, test yourself often. People retained more of a boring lecture if they paused to test what they remembered every 5 minutes. Their minds still wandered, but wandered on topic, rather than anything but . 4. Daydream during breaks \nStopping every now and again to give your mind a chance to wander can invigorate focus, says psychologist Paul Seli of Harvard University. \u201cIf you say to yourself, now I\u2019m going to think about something unrelated, maybe problem-solve something else that is on your mind, and then come back to your task. That can definitely be beneficial,\u201d he says. 5. De-stress \nYou might think that an adrenaline boost would focus the mind, but stress actually stimulates the release of hormones, including noradrenaline, which bind to receptors in the cognitive control circuits. This in turn makes it harder for them to keep tabs on mind wandering. 6. Get some zeds \nA lack of sleep hammers mental performance in general, and reduces our ability to resist both internal and external distractions. And there\u2019s an added bonus \u2013 sleep is also important for memory consolidation. In fact, recent research suggests that if you have an hour spare before an exam, a nap could be a more effective use of your time than spending it revising. 7. Doodle \nIn one study, people forced to listen to a boring voice recording were able to remember more afterwards if they were allowed to doodle. But content is important. Doodling about something related to what you are trying to remember is more likely to qualify as intentional mind wandering, which can help you focus on the task at hand. Don\u2019t be too elaborate, however \u2013 if your doodles become too engaging, the whole thing might backfire. \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laura kate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul seli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caroline williams  mind", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael esterman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nilli lavie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university college london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston attention and learning laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T11:57:25.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "642c17d7cba293baab612f8ebc4781e13b0b9d2b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowhEmhSWiqrWva6Ky9fLHu4JD.ZO_lSzv1VMJvrP.zKcb7xvSX9y70Ml8xeGSYOjOl8KpE5fTNDAMazuHG645A0-", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/features", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Features", "title": "How to extinguish the inflammation epidemic", "title_full": "How to extinguish the inflammation epidemic", "published": "2017-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/14180000/inflammation.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "642c17d7cba293baab612f8ebc4781e13b0b9d2b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowhEmhSWiqrWva6Ky9fLHu4JD.ZO_lSzv1VMJvrP.zKcb7xvSX9y70Ml8xeGSYOjOl8KpE5fTNDAMazuHG645A0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to extinguish the inflammation epidemic", "text": "14 June 2017 How to extinguish the inflammation epidemic Stress, obesity and poor diet trigger persistent inflammation, which can lead to heart disease and depression. We\u2019re finally working out how to fight it Robert Carter By Caroline Williams \nJOB, kids, mortgage, bills, groceries, housework\u2026 coping with modern life can sometimes feel like a remorseless treadmill. Many of us end up exhausted, with a vague feeling that all this pressure can\u2019t be doing us any good. But we do it anyway, driven by the notion that stress is for wimps. And there\u2019s always a glass of wine and a takeaway to look forward to at the end of the week. \nBig mistake. Far from being for wimps, physical and psychological stress are major triggers of a modern scourge that has been linked with every malady from heart disease, depression and chronic pain to neurodegenerative diseases. That scourge is inflammation. Until recently, we have known little about how what starts as a protective immune process in the body goes awry, and there have been frustratingly few evidence-based suggestions on what we should do about it. But now we are starting to learn more about how the process works, how it connects body and mind, and what we might do to keep it in check. This new understanding is leading to treatments that may finally let us douse this constant fire \u2013 not by stopping it from happening, but by turning it off when it is no longer useful. \nSuch treatments could benefit the millions of people around the world who have chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and coeliac disease. They could also assist those of us who want to have our cake, eat it and not end up inflamed . Finding a way to manage inflammation could help prevent modern life from damaging our long-term physical health. To continue reading this premium article, subscribe for unlimited access.

Bates \nSnakes fed a diet of toxic toads become toxic too \u2014 and they seem to know it. \nWhile many snakes make their own toxins, not all do. Japan\u2019s tiger keelback snake ( Rhabdophis tigrinus ) is one of a handful of species that can store toxins it acquires from its food. \nTiger keelback snakes are usually less than a metre long, an ideal meal for many birds and mammals. But they eat toxic toads and store the toxins in specialised organs on the backs of their necks called nuchal glands . Advertisement \nIf a snake is threatened it arches its neck, making the nuchal gland area more prominent. A predator that bit the snake\u2019s neck would probably get a jet of fluid from the glands straight in the mouth or face, which would be distasteful or even painful. \nBut not all keelbacks exhibit this defensive behaviour. Snakes from a toad-free island flee when attacked, rather than standing their ground. Now it seems the snakes know whether or not they are armed with toxins. \nAkira Mori of Kyoto University, Japan, and Gordon Burghardt of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville reared hatchling snakes from toad-free and toad-rich Japanese islands. The snakes were fed controlled diets containing toxic toads \u2013 or not. \nWhen snakes from the toad-free island were fed toads, they started responding to threats with nuchal gland displays, rather than slithering away. Know thyself \n\u201cSo far as I know, this is the only example in terrestrial vertebrates where there is some indication that animals act as if they are aware of when they are toxic and when they are not,\u201d says Burghardt. \nApart from snakes, plenty of animals acquire toxins from what they eat, but Burghardt says there is no sign they change their behaviour depending on what they have eaten. \u201cPoison dart frogs in captivity are not fed the types of food that make them toxic, but their behaviour towards predators does not seem to have changed at all,\u201d he says. \n\u201cIt is remarkable that the researchers were able to demonstrate not only a difference in behaviour between these two populations, but that if you feed toads to toxin-free snakes, they are able to adjust their behaviour in a manner consistent with being chemically defended,\u201d says Alan Savitzky of Utah State University in Logan. \nHow they know is an open question. The snakes could somehow monitor the amount of toxin in their glands. Alternatively, they might detect changes in the microbial community living in their digestive system, which would be influenced by toxin levels. \nJournal reference: Journal of Comparative Psychology , DOI: 10.1037/com 75 \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T17:27:46.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18b40ed7d45a60ed82d41c6def1c42d52acebb5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLatGJqV0LSBX3Yb7j65LCWa1qPQs7WoajAKlfAou7YDB1gB7FUBBrlZoAmyRZogMbeir2KbM_laGk.HGO2oEv9zFCIMVCfqVUXQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/climate-change", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "The sun\u2019s energy could speed up dark matter so we can detect it", "title_full": "The sun\u2019s energy could speed up dark matter so we can detect it", "published": "2017-10-05T18:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/05151724/prom005.tif_.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18b40ed7d45a60ed82d41c6def1c42d52acebb5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLatGJqV0LSBX3Yb7j65LCWa1qPQs7WoajAKlfAou7YDB1gB7FUBBrlZoAmyRZogMbeir2KbM_laGk.HGO2oEv9zFCIMVCfqVUXQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T18:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "The sun\u2019s energy could speed up dark matter so we can detect it", "text": "The sun\u2019s energy could speed up dark matter so we can detect it Dark matter accelerator? SOHO/NASA By Lean Crane \nWe don\u2019t yet know what dark matter is made of, but the sun might help us find out. If dark matter particles are extremely light, they could bounce off atomic nuclei within the sun and gain enough energy in the process that we could detect them. \nChris Kouvaris at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense and his colleagues calculate that particles of this \u201csub-GeV\u201d dark matter could be accelerated to speeds in excess of 600 kilometres per second in this way. \nDark matter permeates the cosmos, so if these sub-GeV particles exist some of them should be hitting the sun all the time. As they bounce around within the sun, some would gain enough speed to escape towards Earth. Advertisement \nFaster particles are easier to detect because they have more energy, so this solar boost could be the key to making dark matter visible to us. \nBut the sub-GeV dark matter particles will need to interact with the normal matter in our detectors. For this to happen, they will need a helper particle to mediate that interaction. For example, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), another leading contender for dark matter, interact with ordinary matter by exchanging subatomic particles called W and Z bosons. \n\u201cThere are basically two particles that are needed: you need the dark matter particles, and you need some other particle for them to interact through,\u201d says Daniel McKinsey at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cSome of my more sceptical colleagues would say that it\u2019s like believing in two tooth fairies. I say, if you believe in one tooth fairy, why not two?\u201d \nMcKinsey says this idea is still a \u201cbig deal\u201d, because it gives us an entirely new way to look for dark matter after decades of fruitless searching. Need for speed \nThe upper speed limit for particles to remain inside our galaxy is 544 kilometres per second. If they go any faster than that, gravity won\u2019t be able to keep them within the Milky Way. \n\u201cIf it has a larger velocity than the escape velocity of the galaxy, then it\u2019ll go out of the galaxy and we\u2019ll never be able to detect it,\u201d says Kouvaris. Unless, that is, Earth gets in the way \u2013 a prospect that is much more likely if the particles are accelerated to such high speeds by our sun. \nCurrent detectors aren\u2019t sensitive enough to see any of these particles that happen to hit our planet after getting a boost from the sun. But upcoming instruments like the upgraded CRESST-III detector in Italy may be able to detect them. \nDark matter makes up over 80 per cent of the universe\u2019s mass, so if the new detectors do find these particles, Kouvaris and McKinsey agree, it\u2019ll be the biggest discovery in modern physics. And if they don\u2019t, researchers will simply have to find new ways to look.

Burton/Getty By Douglas Heaven \nThe internet has a personality problem . Abusive behaviour is a scourge in most corners of the internet, from website comments sections to social media to chat sessions in online games. Attempts to clamp down have yielded frustrating results \u2013 the concept is just too slippery. But a new way of automatically identifying the subtle linguistic fingerprints of true hate speech \u2013 and separating it from more benign uses of similar words \u2013 could finally help crack down on the worst offenders. \n\u201cHate speech is notoriously difficult to detect,\u201d says Dana Warmsley at Cornell University in New York. Simply using offensive language does not make someone abusive. People swear for all sorts of reasons. Friends call each other names for fun. Advertisement \nMost platforms rely on their users to report abuse. But human moderators cannot keep up with the torrent of objectionable content. \nAnother option is to detect hate speech automatically. Earlier this year, Google tried to assign comments a \u201ctoxic\u201d score based on how similar they were to other phrases people had previously deemed offensive. However, the shortcomings overwhelmed the positive effects. \u201cyou\u2019re pretty smart for a girl\u201d was deemed 18 per cent similar to comments people had deemed toxic, whereas \u201ci love Fuhrer\u201d was 2 per cent similar. \nSo Haji Mohammad Saleem at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and his colleagues went for a different approach. Instead of focusing on isolated words and phrases, they taught machine learning software to spot hate speech by learning how members of hateful communities speak . They trained their system on a data dump that contains most of the posts made to Reddit between 2006 and 2016. They focused on three groups who are often the target of abuse: African Americans, overweight people and women. For each of these, they chose the most active support and abuse groups on Reddit to train their software. They also took comments from Voat \u2013 a forum site similar to Reddit \u2013 as well as individual websites dedicated to hate speech. Offensive speech \nThe team found that their approach contained fewer false positives than a keyword-based detector. For example, it was able to flag comments that contained no offensive keyword, such as \u201cI don\u2019t see the problem here. Animals attack other animals all the time,\u201d in which the term \u201canimals\u201d was being used as a racist slur. \n\u201cComparing hateful and non-hateful communities to find the language that distinguishes them is a clever solution,\u201d says Thomas Davidson at Cornell University, who \u2013 together with Warmsley \u2013 has trained machine learning software to tell the difference between offensive and inoffensive speech by feeding it hand-picked examples of both. \nBut he is not convinced the solution is as widely applicable as Saleem and his colleagues suggest. The team tested their system on Reddit comments but they have not shown that it will catch targeted abuse on Twitter or Facebook, for example. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a sensible approach but it won\u2019t catch everything,\u201d says Joanna Bryson at the University of Bath, UK. The system still missed clearly offensive speech, such as \u201cBlack people are terrible\u201d and others that are clearly racist, or fat-shaming. Bryson points out that a keyword-based approach would have caught these comments. \nBut it could be yet another tool in the hands of competent moderators. Despite the difficulties, there may be no way to avoid keeping humans in the loop. \u201cUltimately, hate speech is a subjective phenomenon that requires human judgment to identify,\u201d says Davidson.

Advertisement \nThe 19 species all live in a small area of Myanmar just 90 by 50 kilometres in size. \u201cThat\u2019s the really amazing thing about it,\u201d says Grismer. \u201cThey all come from such a small area.\u201d \nIt\u2019s common to find lots of closely-related species of invertebrates like snails or insects in such a small area, but it is unprecedented for a backboned animal, say Grismer. \u201cFor lizards, it is remarkable.\u201d Another new Cyrtodactylus gecko L. Lee Grismer \nThe reason is likely to do with the unusual landscape. In an otherwise-flat lowland area, great blocks of limestone rise up to 400 metres high. Their surfaces are highly corrugated and sculpted by erosion, and sometimes riddled with caves. \nThese limestone blocks, some just a kilometre across, are evolutionary islands where isolated geckos have evolved into separate species. The limestone-dwelling geckos tend to have longer legs and toes, and more slender bodies, than their lowland kin. \nGrismer\u2019s team was asked to explore the area in Myanmar by the charity Fauna & Flora International , which is campaigning to preserve the unusual limestone habitat. The new geckos all lived in the same small area L. Lee Grismer \nIn their first trip in 2016, the team found the first 15 geckos, as well as new snakes and frogs. \u201cIt was fricking crazy, man,\u201d says Grismer. \u201cIn 19 days we found 23 new species.\u201d \nIn a later trip, they found the four geckos yet to be formally described. \nWhile the newly found geckos are restricted to tiny areas, they are abundant there, maybe because they are safe from many of the predators on the surrounding plains. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re the only one who occupies a 7-Eleven,\u201d says Grismer. \u201cIt may not be a Wal-Mart, but it\u2019s all yours.\u201d Hemiphyllodactylus montawaensis L. Lee Grismer \nSome of the blocks are being mined for limestone, and there were explosions nearby as the team worked, says Grismer. But other blocks have caves regarded as sacred by Buddhists, and these are fiercely guarded by monks. \nMost of the new species of gecko belong to a large genus collectively known as bent-toed geckos . But to Grismer\u2019s surprise, the team also found three species of dwarf gecko, which are usually found only on cloudy mountaintops .

Edward Marti/JILA By Aylin Woodward \nIt\u2019s about time. The most precise atomic clock ever made has been created by arranging strontium atoms in a grid-like pattern and then stacking those grids like pancakes. \nMost atomic clocks use atoms of the isotope caesium-133. The ticking of time is measured through microwaves emitted by the electrons around those atoms jumping from a lower to higher orbit as they absorb and then lose energy from a laser. \nBut these clocks are constrained in how precisely they can divide time because caesium electrons have a speed limit: they can only jump back and forth 9 billion times per second. The electrons in strontium atoms can transition nearly 1 million billion times per second. Advertisement \n\u201cIn 2014, the world\u2019s most accurate optical clock wouldn\u2019t lose or gain one second in the entire age of the universe ,\u201d says Jun Ye at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Previous caesium clocks kept time accurately to within a second over the course of 300 million years. \nNow, Ye\u2019s group has built a strontium clock that is so precise, out of every 10 quintillion ticks only 3.5 would be out of sync \u2013 the first atomic clock ever to reach that level of precision. Controlling the atoms \nTo build a more precise clock, Ye and his team designed a 3D structure that let them measure signals from more atoms at once within the width of the laser beam. But if you pack in too many, the signal can get blurred by collisions between atoms. \nThe latticework enabled the researchers to survey atoms that were much more densely packed together \u2013 10 trillion atoms per cubic centimetre compared with previous clocks with 10 billion atoms per cubic centimetre \u2013 and have better control of those atoms\u2019 interactions, minimising how often they crash into each other. \nThey cooled the atoms to -273\u02daC and trapped each one in its own spot to control the interactions between them. \u201cImagine a scenario where you have single-person housing in a city block. One person lives in each house and neighbours are never allowed in,\u201d says Ye. \u201cEach atom fits in one particular site.\u201d \nYe says the ultracold temperatures turn the atoms into what is known as a quantum gas. \u201cWhen atoms in the gaseous phase are very hot, they\u2019re moving apart and colliding with each other,\u201d he says. \u201cThis changes when you lower the temperature of the gas so much that these particles start to move like waves \u2013 they start to avoid each other.\u201d Time will tell \nMore precise clocks will allow us to test theories like Einstein\u2019s general relativity \u2013 which says clocks run differently should they experience different gravitational forces \u2013 and search for gravitational waves that alter the passage of time in deep space. \nAlthough it is the most precise atomic clock ever made, it hasn\u2019t run long enough to confirm how accurate it will remain over time, Ye says. \nChristian Lisdat at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Germany is interested in how the 3D-lattice arrangement will influence the clock\u2019s accuracy, but he is convinced the results are sound. \u201cIt is an impressive demonstration of what one can do,\u201d Lisdat says.

Now it seems the problem isn\u2019t limited to Europe and North America, where the alarm was first sounded.

In three years they amassed 198 samples from every continent except Antarctica, and tested them for neonicotinoids. \nThey found that three-quarters of the samples contained at least one of the five neonicotinoid pesticides. Of those, nearly half contained between two and five different neonicotinoids. \nMost worryingly, in 48 per cent of the contaminated samples, the neonicotinoids were at levels that exceeded the minimum dose known to cause \u201cmarked detrimental effects\u201d in pollinators. \u201cThe situation is indeed bad for pollinators,\u201d says Aebi. It\u2019s all around us \n\u201cFinding neonicotinoids in honey is perhaps not surprising,\u201d says Christopher Connolly of the University of Dundee, UK. After all, the pesticides are widely used. \u201cBut to find neuroactive levels, in so many samples at many global sites, is shocking.\u201d \nBees survive the winter by eating honey, so the results imply they are chronically exposed to neonicotinoids. \u201cRecent scientific evidence showed an increased sensitivity to neonicotinoids after frequent or long-term exposure,\u201d says Aebi. \nThe fact that the honey contained cocktails of neonicotinoids may also be a problem. They all act on different receptor proteins in the nervous systems of the insects. Some chemicals can boost each others\u2019 toxic effects over time, says Connolly. However, there is only indirect evidence of this happening with the neonicotinoids so far. \nFrustratingly, we have the data to figure out how real-world levels of the pesticides affect bees , but not in a useful form. Farmers in Europe and North America record their use of neonicotinoids, says Connolly, but this data needs to be gathered into geographical databases. Such databases could reveal local correlations between pesticide use and insect health. Aebi and his team are now urging governments to start collecting the data.

Photodsotiroff/Getty By Mallory Locklear \nWatch the cost. People are more likely to experience stronger side effects when a treatment appears to be more expensive, according to a study of the nocebo effect . \nWhile the placebo effect means that some people feel better when they have unknowingly been given a sham or control treatment, the nocebo works the opposite way. Researchers frequently observe nocebo effects in clinical trials, when people who receive a placebo experience negative side effects as if they had been given an actual drug. \nPlacebos are known to have stronger positive effects the more expensive the person receiving them believes them to be. Alexandra Tinnermann , at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, and her colleagues wondered if price might also affect the strength of the nocebo effect. Advertisement \nThe team created two packages for fake creams and told volunteers that they are used to treat itchy skin. One package looked like an expensive pharmaceutical brand name, while the other looked like a cheaper, generic medication. \nThe participants were shown one of the two creams and told that it was believed to increase a person\u2019s sensitivity to pain as a side effect. Pain sensitivity \nThe team then applied creams to participants\u2019 arms, and exposed their limbs to increasing levels of heat. Each person was asked to rank the discomfort they felt. \nThe participants given the more expensive-looking cream reported more pain than those given the cheaper-looking cream. Relative to a control cream that was described as having no active ingredients, the generic-looking cream raised pain on average by around 3 per cent, while the expensive-looking cream increased pain by nearly 30 per cent. \nThe finding confirms that the price of a treatment effects not only placebo strength, but nocebo power too. \nDuring the pain test, the team collected fMRI images of the brain, brainstem and spinal cord. They found that activity in a particular area of the prefrontal cortex and a region called the periaqueductal gray varied depending on what cream had been given. Both these areas are part of the neural pain pathway, and have also been implicated in mediating placebo effects. \nThe findings may help refine how doctors nurses and pharmacists talk to patients about medications, enabling them to try to minimize the nocebo effect, says Tinnermann. \nJournal reference: Science , DOI: 10.1126/science.aan1221", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:01:30.549+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6974f00c9b0e3c2fb3659a401e8ea1fff2cac493", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaoH1i.o5xyO3sb0JIUnROHNlzjpv8PKLrhE6xY3pUYFeHJUssRbpK1RQUgtV3gFc37HwNSA3eCiGyimqXXpzvDjc2qotNsIdKg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "", "title": "Side effects are worse when we think medication looks expensive", "title_full": "Side effects are worse when we think medication looks expensive", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.214, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/05152843/gettyimages-460900717.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6974f00c9b0e3c2fb3659a401e8ea1fff2cac493", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaoH1i.o5xyO3sb0JIUnROHNlzjpv8PKLrhE6xY3pUYFeHJUssRbpK1RQUgtV3gFc37HwNSA3eCiGyimqXXpzvDjc2qotNsIdKg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Side effects are worse when we think medication looks expensive", "text": "5 Side effects are worse when we think medication looks expensive \nPeople have been found to experience stronger side effects when a treatment looks more expensive, according to a study of the nocebo effect ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T13:02:04.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be5f52d0d0fa9e589ecd8a6cb5112bb297e9bb3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaiN18l6HH_BJB6Syr55hEpQoBNvkKcsoiZ.YNUL6guFhAYxRZZRvfiG9JZHgEpHgcMr8uOIstL2LMPiC7d3vkkPFFOIPSTyAVQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/aviation", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Protein injection could prevent hair loss during chemotherapy", "title_full": "Protein injection could prevent hair loss during chemotherapy", "published": "2017-10-06T14:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/06104504/gettyimages-853406782.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be5f52d0d0fa9e589ecd8a6cb5112bb297e9bb3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaiN18l6HH_BJB6Syr55hEpQoBNvkKcsoiZ.YNUL6guFhAYxRZZRvfiG9JZHgEpHgcMr8uOIstL2LMPiC7d3vkkPFFOIPSTyAVQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T14:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Protein injection could prevent hair loss during chemotherapy", "text": "Protein injection could prevent hair loss during chemotherapy Hair-promoting hormone could work with all types of chemotherapy GeraldMercier/Getty By Alice Klein \nMice injected with a hair-promoting protein did not lose their hair during chemotherapy. The finding raises the hope that people undergoing cancer treatment can one day avoid this distressing side effect. \nHair loss is one of the most feared side effect s of chemotherapy. One study of women with breast cancer found that around 8 per cent had considered refusing treatment to save their locks. \nThere are few options for people receiving treatment. Scalp-cooling caps freeze and constrict blood vessels to stop chemo drugs from flowing into hair follicles. But they are expensive, work for only 50 per cent of people , extend treatment by two hours and cause discomfort and headaches. Advertisement \nOther people have experimented with using the hair loss treatment minoxidil during chemo, but a randomised controlled trial found no benefit . \nPart of the problem is our limited understanding of how chemotherapy damages hair follicles, says Sung-Jan Lin at National Taiwan University. \nTo address this, his team looked at the role of a protein called p53. This protein is activated during chemo and helps to suppress tumour growth, but may also suppress hair growth, since hair cells rapidly divide like tumour cells. A previous study found that mice missing the p53 protein did not shed their fur during chemo. Hair-promoting protein \nStudying p53, Lin and his colleagues have found that it blocks the activity of a hair-promoting protein called WNT3a. This gave them an idea: if you inject WNT3a directly into the scalp when administering chemo, will it stop hair loss? \nTo test this, they dosed mice with a common chemotherapy agent. Straight afterwards, they injected WNT3a-soaked beads under the surface of their skin. The microscopic beads \u2013 which were coloured blue \u2013 helped to keep the protein in a small area so the team could study its effects. \nSure enough, areas injected with the WNT3a-soaked beads were still coated with thick fur five days after chemo. In contrast, areas injected with untreated beads went bald. \nWhen the researchers examined patches of skin under the microscope, they found the protein treatment doubled the number of stem cells in the base of the hair follicles within the first day of injection, allowing more hairs to sprout. \nThe team is now working on adapting the treatment for use in people. It would not be practical or safe to inject the hair-promoting protein into the scalp in bead form, says Lin. \u201cWe might need to inject it into the scalp using arrays of fine needles so that many of the hair follicles can be covered,\u201d he says. His team is also testing compounds they have designed for activating WNT3a that could be spread over the scalp in cream or gel form. \nRichard de Boer, a medical oncologist at Epworth Centre in Melbourne, Australia, says the treatment could be a big help. While scalp cooling has led to many success stories, it doesn\u2019t work well for some types of chemotherapy, he says. \u201cNew hair-saving options that work with all chemotherapy regimens would be very welcome.\u201d Journal reference: Cancer Research , DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0667 \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T14:34:39.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b630372df18eb6ee7c8c890a1081d5212ee1d862", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_vBYbGbNk_OkABlzm5UMJC9cJlh83VpEKQcUj57tcaMgdsQt8MJ210-", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/climate-change", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "How to be Human: The reason we are so scarily hairy", "title_full": "How to be Human: The reason we are so scarily hairy", "published": "2017-10-06T15:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04180000/gettyimages-518337815.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b630372df18eb6ee7c8c890a1081d5212ee1d862", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_vBYbGbNk_OkABlzm5UMJC9cJlh83VpEKQcUj57tcaMgdsQt8MJ210-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T15:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to be Human: The reason we are so scarily hairy", "text": "4 October 2017 How to be Human : The reason we are so scarily hairy We might seem less hirsute than other beasts, but we\u2019re not, and this extract from New Scientist \u2019s book How to be Human reveals why our locks are so strange Hair everywhere Getty Images/Hero Images \nGood God, you\u2019re a hairy beast. You may not think you are, and compared with, say, a chimpanzee , you appear distinctly bald. But in fact your entire body (with the exception of the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet) is covered in hair. All told you have about 5 million follicles, about the same as chimps and other primates. \nBut the similarities stop there. Human hair is decidedly strange . Most of our body hair is so wispy and short as to be almost invisible, though in some places it is coarse and curly. Our head hair is almost uniquely long and flamboyant. We are pretty much the only animal to have hair that grows continuously for many years, and also to suffer the indignity of going bald. No wonder our relationship with our hair is a tangled one. A duet of hairs \nHuman hair comes in two basic types: terminal hair, which grows on the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes, and vellus hair, which is found everywhere else. Beyond that, the main difference between hair types is how long they grow for before the follicle runs out of steam. This is what determines their length and thickness. Advertisement \nHair follicles go through cycles of growth and dormancy . During the growth phase the hair grows continuously at about 0.4 millimetres per day, getting longer and thicker in the process. But at some point the hair-producing cells die off and growth stops. The hair falls out and the follicle goes dormant for around six months before sprouting new hair-producing cells and entering a new growth phase. \nThe length of the growth phase is controlled by hormones . Leg hairs grow for about two months, which is why they are short and fine. Armpit hairs make it to six months, but head hairs grow non-stop for six years or more. That means head hair can theoretically grow to almost a metre in length. \nIdeas abound as to why evolution has endowed us with such a unique combination of hair types. The leading one is that when our bipedal ancestors moved out of the forests and onto the searing heat of the savannah, they needed to keep their bodies cool while also sheltering their big brains from the sun. Body hair receded, removing an unnecessary insulating layer and also allowing the skin to be cooled by sweating. Hair loss was also presumably aided by technological innovations such as clothes, fire and cave-dwelling, which lessened the importance of fur for keeping warm at night. Head hair, meanwhile, became thicker and more luxuriant, protecting our ancestors\u2019 brains from the midday sun, and also retaining heat in the cold. \nGenetic evidence suggests that we became furless around 1.7 million years ago. Around this time our ancestor Homo erectus was living on the baking savannah, which supports the thermoregulation hypothesis. Look! No parasites \nBut it is not the only possibility. We may also have lost body hair to improve our ability to identify others and to make communication easier, or to resist disease, since fur is a prime habitat for parasites. There\u2019s also sexual selection, which was Charles Darwin \u2018s preferred explanation. For whatever reason, the least hairy of our ancestors were considered the most attractive and so produced more offspring. Hair-free skin may have been a billboard to advertise good health and hence attract mates \u2013 a sexual come-on saying, \u201cLook how unblemished and parasite-free I am.\u201d \nSexual selection could also explain our head hair. Most people find a strong, healthy head of hair attractive. Indeed, precisely because our head hair needs so much care, it makes a perfect hoarding upon which to advertise social and sexual status. Grooming is time-consuming, and so having well-groomed hair shows you are resourceful and have good social contacts. If this is correct, then the main function of head hair is to be cut and styled for maximum impact. This might explain why lank, unkempt locks are the mark of the social pariah. Prehistoric styling \nSome of the most ancient figurines do have coiffed hair. The oldest known three-dimensional representation of a human, the 25,000-year-old ivory Venus of Brassempouy, has elegant shoulder-length hair. And hair products are nothing new either. The 2300-year-old Clonycavan Man, discovered in a bog in County Meath, Ireland, was wearing hair gel made of plant oils and pine resin. \nHair may also have been used to signal group identity. Throughout the ages and across cultures, we have used hairstyles as a mark of membership: think Roundheads, Rastafarians and rockabillies. \nEnough about the hair on your head. Pubic hair is possibly even more unusual. Most primates have finer hair around their genitals than on the rest of their body, but adult humans are the exact opposite. \nThere\u2019s no accepted explanation. One possibility is that since thicker hair coincides with regions where we have apocrine (scent) glands, it may serve to concentrate or waft odours that signal sexual maturity. Pubic hair may also protect the genitals during sex and at other times \u2013 reducing chafing while walking, for example \u2013 and also helps keep our most sensitive regions warm and free of draughts. \nWhatever it evolved for, many people now subject the hair in their pubic regions to as much grooming as the hair on their heads, while ruthlessly removing it from the rest of their bodies. Hairless we ain\u2019t \u2013 but not for lack of trying. Baldylocks \nPity the human male: along with the stump-tailed macaque, he is the only primate to routinely suffer the indignity of a receding hairline. \nBy age 30, a quarter of men have started to go bald, and by 45, half have. Male pattern baldness has a predictable trajectory: hair begins to disappear on the temples, then on the top of the head, before staging a general retreat that leaves the entire pate hairless. \nExcept that it doesn\u2019t. Baldness is not about having no hair; it is about having the wrong sort of hair. Bald heads have just as many follicles as any other \u2013 about 100,000 \u2013 but the follicles have ceased to function properly and only produce colourless and wispy hairs. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cWhy are humans so hairy?\u201d \n\u2022 This is an extract from How To Be Human , our new illustrated book about the most amazing species on the planet (John Murray) \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T15:16:36.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d81fdc7017035d6ab9fe3e1b8a3114d21d883d32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLauSPph2fSS_FNCYr1OP5t7jY0Z4L27YTC0yDXcqLC5CojPFd._652kFe8Hb0fNuRJDnvQLIrPTVNtz55gOvhrhFEiOzQzbEHmA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/food-drink", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "We can\u2019t ever know whether or not our universe is a simulation", "title_full": "We can\u2019t ever know whether or not our universe is a simulation", "published": "2017-10-06T16:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/06131144/z1069_007.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d81fdc7017035d6ab9fe3e1b8a3114d21d883d32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLauSPph2fSS_FNCYr1OP5t7jY0Z4L27YTC0yDXcqLC5CojPFd._652kFe8Hb0fNuRJDnvQLIrPTVNtz55gOvhrhFEiOzQzbEHmA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T16:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "We can\u2019t ever know whether or not our universe is a simulation", "text": "We can\u2019t ever know whether or not our universe is a simulation Millennium Images, UK/Brighitta Moser-Clark \nAre we living in a simulation?

But even the fittest among us suffer in thin air: the lower oxygen content at altitude can lead to cognitive effects, including memory loss and attention difficulties. \nThere is little you can do to prevent these symptoms other than acclimatise \u2013 but this takes time and doesn\u2019t always work. A drug called oxiracetam might be the answer. Advertisement Up and down \nShengLi Hu at the Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China, and her colleagues took men from the military up to 4000 metres above sea level. \nAll of the men lived in towns around 1800 metres above sea level. During the study, they spent eight days at this altitude, before climbing for three days to reach 4000 metres, where they stayed for up to a month. \nTwenty participants took 800mg of oxiracetam three times per day for the first 15 days of the study, while another 20 men received no intervention. The men performed tests of attention and memory at the start and end of the study and 20 days in, by which time they had been at 4000 metres for nine days. \nWhile all participants experienced a drop in cognitive ability at 4000 metres, those who took oxiracetam showed a much smaller decline than the control group. \nUsing a technique that measures the brain\u2019s response to sounds, the team found that those who took the drug also showed less of a decline in the speed at which they could process sensory information. Going with the flow \nBlood flow measurements indicated that at high altitudes, certain parts of the cerebral circulatory system contracted and dilated in a way that promoted blood flow to the brain stem. This isn\u2019t surprising, since the brain stem plays a critical role in the maintenance of basic vital signs. \nThe team also found that the brain stem received blood at the expense of brain areas responsible for more advanced cognitive functions. But in people who took oxiracetam, more arteries dilated, so blood flow throughout the brain was increased. This may be how the drug seems to lessen cognitive problems associated with low oxygen. It is yet to be seen whether diverting the blood in this way could have any negative effects in the long run. \n\u201cThe results are striking and imply that oxiracetam may be beneficial for helping to mitigate cognitive deficits caused by altitude,\u201d says Timothy Hales at the University of Dundee, UK. \nDespite a wealth of people admitting to taking numerous kinds of smart drugs to improve their memory or focus , there is little research on oxiracetam in healthy people. In a single study in older adults with dementia , the drug appeared to help improve performance in some memory-associated tasks. \nOxiracetam is not licensed for medical use in the UK, but the drug is known to be a mild stimulant, says Hales. \u201cCoca leaves have been used by native Andeans for centuries to overcome altitude sickness and this is attributed to their modest cocaine content. So perhaps it is not surprising that benefit can be derived from another, albeit mild, stimulant.\u201d Journal reference: Brain and Behaviour , DOI: 10.1002/brb3.762 \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T18:58:21.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75dfb95720aa66141c45d8dbc744910c797ee798", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLajSZl6._CchIUni_8gTMBIPbDWRDVCUg97Wq3Z66FZ4VVCsOV4vI8SZpRtB17kd2fX0vS6sg4WKDzBrng7T6rMpCb.r6C5xFHw--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Lunar volcanoes and lava lakes gave the early moon an atmosphere", "title_full": "Lunar volcanoes and lava lakes gave the early moon an atmosphere", "published": "2017-10-06T20:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/06171934/a17_m_2444.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75dfb95720aa66141c45d8dbc744910c797ee798", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLajSZl6._CchIUni_8gTMBIPbDWRDVCUg97Wq3Z66FZ4VVCsOV4vI8SZpRtB17kd2fX0vS6sg4WKDzBrng7T6rMpCb.r6C5xFHw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T20:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lunar volcanoes and lava lakes gave the early moon an atmosphere", "text": "Lunar volcanoes and lava lakes gave the early moon an atmosphere Atmosphere is long gone NASA By Jeff Hecht \nIf you travelled back in time 3.5 billion years and looked up at the night sky, you would have seen an atmosphere around the moon. Though today it retains only a few tenuous wisps of atmosphere, new calculations show that massive volcanic eruptions released enough hot gas to create one that took 70 million years to leak away. \nAstronomers had thought the moon was dry as a bone, yet we recently learned that the magma ocean covering the newborn moon 4.5 billion years ago released hot vapours of sodium and silica that formed a short-lived atmosphere . Now it seems a second lunar atmosphere developed 3.5 billion years ago as a result of eruptions flooding a large crater to form Mare Imbrium, a lava plain on the near side of the moon. \nStarting nearly a decade ago, studies using sensitive new instruments revealed volatile material embedded in lunar volcanic glass collected by Apollo astronauts . The glass came from the dark lunar basins and hinted that the large volcanic eruptions that formed them between 3.8 and 3.1 billion years ago also emitted vast amounts of gas. Advertisement Dune on the moon \nNow Debra Needham and David Kring at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, have calculated these emissions based on the estimated volumes of the lava flows. The largest emission was the roughly 10 trillion tonnes of gas that erupted along with the 5.3 million cubic kilometres of lava that filled the Imbrium basin. That would have raised lunar air pressure to about 1 per cent that of modern Earth, or 1.5 times the density of today\u2019s Martian atmosphere. \n\u201cIf you had any temperature gradient on the lunar surface, there would have been wind,\u201d Needham says. With dust on the surface and enough wind to transport it, she adds, it could have been like \u201c Dune on the moon\u201d. But within 70 million years, all the atmospheric gas escaped or froze out in the polar regions, and because it all happened so long ago, no evidence of these winds would remain. \nJames Day at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California says this atmosphere formation process could account for the distribution of water and other volatiles on the surface of the moon and their loss from its interior. It could also help us understand how planetary atmospheres form, he says.

Any disturbance that leads to the mothers separating from the pups is \u201cbad news\u201d for the baby seals. \nGoodman with Sue Wilson and colleagues gathered data from observers who travelled on 39 icebreaker trips from 2006 to 2013 in the northern Caspian Sea. This sea is a major oil and gas drilling site. Advertisement \nIt is also the only home of the Caspian seals , which are found nowhere else. Caspian seal mothers give birth late in January on the open ice, and suckle their pups for about five weeks. The pups are born with white coats similar to ringed seals, and are vulnerable while still dependent on their mothers for nutrition. The mothers often choose thick, solid ice, with features like ice folds to protect the pups from wind. \nGoodman identified 184 occasions on which icebreakers came within 10 metres of a mother and pup. The mother typically fled and tried to take her pup with her, but sometimes left it behind. In one case, a mother temporarily abandoned a newborn pup. Because the icebreakers were moving, it was not always possible to tell what eventually happened. However, in at least two cases mother and pup ended up a long way apart, and may have lost each other. \nIf the pups get knocked into the water by icebreakers or the waves they create, they can get hypothermic, says Goodman. Their coats aren\u2019t yet heavy enough to withstand the cold water. \u201cThat can be very costly in terms of energy, or in the worst case it can lead to the death of the pup,\u201d he says. Save the baby seals \nGoodman says the best way to avoid such problems is to send fewer icebreakers through seal habitats during breeding season. When such transits are unavoidable, ships might avoid seal hotspots. Finally, ships could carry trained observers to advise the crew on how to avoid seals. \nUnfortunately, icebreakers don\u2019t always have a lot of flexibility in their movement, says Erin Moreland at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The problem is compounded by low visibility at night. \nInstead, Moreland says drones might offer more advance warning of what\u2019s ahead. She has also seen ships equipped with thermal imaging. \nIt\u2019s unclear how significant the effects of icebreakers are for Caspian seal populations, Goodman says. He has since briefed the Kazakh company that operates the icebreakers. \u201cThey responded well to the advice that was given to them.\u201d \nCaspian seals are considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature \u2013 mainly because they get caught up in sturgeon nets from illegal fishing operations, which have proliferated since the collapse of the Soviet Union. \u201cIf you ask me what to do to protect Caspian seals, it would be to sort out the by-catch problem first and foremost,\u201d says Goodman. \nThe study implies that related species, like ring seals in the Arctic, could also be affected by icebreakers, says Dan Costa at the University of California, Santa Cruz. But the risk is likely to be lower for these species. \u201cThe difference in the Arctic is that the species are just much more numerous,\u201d he says. \nHowever, shipping traffic in the Arctic is increasing and viable habitat for Arctic seals will shrink due to issues like climate change. That means the icebreakers might ultimately pose a problem for those seals too, says Costa.

The discovery that our characters change is unnerving, but embrace it and it can be empowering Daniel Stolle By Emma Young \nAS A child, Wendy Johnson was extremely shy. \u201cOne of my report cards said: \u2018Wendy is so shy, it\u2019s painful to watch!\u201d She\u2019s not like that now. \u201cI am definitely a person who learned to overcome overt shyness,\u201d says Johnson, a psychologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK. She says shyness is an indicator of a low level of extroversion, a key measure of personality, which she studies. So does this mean Johnson has changed her personality? Undoubtedly, she says. \nThat answer might surprise you. Most of us consider our personality to be an integral and unchanging part of who we are \u2013 perhaps the essence of that thing we call the self. In 1887, psychologist William James went so far as to argue that it becomes \u201cset like plaster\u201d by the age of 30. His idea stuck. Psychologists have long debated how to measure personality, settling eventually on the \u201cbig five\u201d traits (see \u201c What are you like? \u201c). But at least they were able to agree on a definition: personality refers to an individual\u2019s thought patterns and behaviours, which tend to persist over time. Now mounting evidence is undermining that notion. Personality is far more mutable than we thought. That may be a little unsettling. But it\u2019s also good news for the almost 90 per cent of us who wish our personalities were at least a little different . \nThere\u2019s no doubt that personality is partly genetic. What\u2019s less certain is how much is down to our genes and how much to nurture .

A recent closed-door colloquium held at a top British university brought together two dozen leading AI researchers and a group of illustrious humanities scholars to address philosophical questions raised by AI. \nIn the event, however, the two contingents struggled to find common ground. The engineers described their work in precise, dense terms, mostly skipping over its implications. The scholars, too, critiqued the descriptions rather than tackling the implications; some seemed affronted by the very idea of thinking machines. Advertisement \nThat\u2019s a pity, because we really need fresh thinking on AI. Public discussion is dominated by scary stories about the elimination of human workers \u2013 or of humans, full stop. Meanwhile, machine learning applications are quietly becoming integral to our daily lives, with little consideration of the consequences (see \u201c How scaremongering steps us asking the right questions about AI \u201c). \nThose consequences are myriad, poorly understood, and evolving rapidly. AIs are now involved in many decisions that significantly affect our lives. But there is also growing evidence that they aren\u2019t necessarily ready to shoulder all the responsibilities they are being given. \nMachine learning alone may be fine when it comes to optimising, say, your power usage. But in less clear-cut tasks, such as healthcare, the combination of human and machine can be more effective. Then there\u2019s the problem of \u201calgorithmic bias\u201d in AI decision-making (see \u201c Biased policing is made worse by errors in pre-crime algorithms \u201c). \nArtificial intelligence really has made great strides in recent years, so much so that initial awe at these machines\u2019 uncanny abilities is giving way to hucksterism. But for all their smarts, the machines can\u2019t tell us how we could best deploy them. For that, we need people willing to engage in a genuine meeting of minds. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cMore smarts needed\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T13:14:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36152832e0ea80b9d5bd3fd13a6df48c66cdb9be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaibvnOkqRCstMbFyY1vlVfIvh2KET1MwiJFVDqSSNkIMPiKg4kkeIJcMpuYY3RLFNFoTkKmdeJ9DmmSpL.tpEDd.5icb9mU4XQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/health", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Nobel prizes would be better without all the fame and fortune", "title_full": "Nobel prizes would be better without all the fame and fortune", "published": "2017-10-09T13:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09102503/rs30033_img_3322.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 137, "comments": 0, "shares": 137}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "36152832e0ea80b9d5bd3fd13a6df48c66cdb9be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLaibvnOkqRCstMbFyY1vlVfIvh2KET1MwiJFVDqSSNkIMPiKg4kkeIJcMpuYY3RLFNFoTkKmdeJ9DmmSpL.tpEDd.5icb9mU4XQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-09T13:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nobel prizes would be better without all the fame and fortune", "text": "9 October 2017 Nobel prizes would be better without all the fame and fortune A Nobel prize brings big money and celebrity status for a few, but that's at odds with modern, collaborative science done for the greater good Let\u2019s celebrate the work of whole teams Caltech/MIT/LIGO Lab \nEvery October, the world awaits a series of announcements from Sweden, as the winners of the prestigious Nobel prizes are named. This year they included the physics prize awarded to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne for the development of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), and the subsequent direct detection of gravitational waves. \nSure, it is one of the great successes of modern science, but remember also that it is the culmination of a century of theory, experimentation and observation. \nFounded in 1901, the Nobel prizes each single out To continue reading this premium article, register or login for free for unlimited access.
