The concept was invented by a former judge in California, who became the first donor to the scheme in 2014. Howard Broadman wanted to give a kidney to his 4-year-old grandson Quinn Gerlach, whose chronic kidney disease means he is likely to need a transplant within the next decade or two.  When somebody needs a new organ, they go on a transplant list, but organs are in short supply. There are currently more than 93,000 people in the US waiting for a kidney, and 12 of these die waiting every day. One way to get around this is to have a friend or relative choose to donate a kidney directly to you. Advertisement Read more: Would you give one of your kidneys to a stranger?  “I know Quinn will eventually need a transplant, but by the time he’s ready, I’ll be too old to give him one of my kidneys,” says Broadman. He says he first considered being altruistic, and simply donating a kidney to someone else. “But then I started thinking ‘this is bullshit – I should get something for this’.”  Broadman approached the University of California, Los Angeles, and asked them to give him a voucher for donating a kidney to someone now that will make his grandson more likely to get a transplant when he needs one in the future. UCLA surgeon Jeffrey Veale agreed, and set up a voucher scheme.  Veale and his team’s analysis of the scheme, published this month, suggests it really does encourage more people to donate kidneys. Veale says wider adoption of the scheme could lead to thousands more donations. Chain of donations  A previous study found that over a third of people who require a transplant are unable to accept a kidney from a friend or relative willing to donate because of biological incompatibility .  Doctors tackle this problem by matching up incompatible donors with other patients facing the same problem, creating long donation “chains”. Rather than giving directly to their incompatible loved ones, the relatives and friends give kidneys to each other instead, enabling everyone to find a match.  Each voucher in Veale’s scheme helps to get one of these chains started, sometimes enabling dozens more transplants. Broadman started a chain when he donated his kidney to Kathy DeGrandis, a retired airport manager. DeGrandis’s sister previously hadn’t donated because she was incompatible, but she then donated her kidney to a stranger , and that person’s family then donated to someone else.  Each donor was given a voucher that can be used by a loved one. The voucher doesn’t guarantee a kidney transplant, but it gives a person high priority for being included in a donation chain when an appropriate match becomes available.  Working with the UCLA team, the US National Kidney Registry has so far issued 21 kidney vouchers across 30 hospitals, each one stimulating donation chains that have led to a total of 68 new transplants.  “If only a fraction of the 40 million chronic kidney disease patients in the US had a donor like Judge Broadman, then tens of thousands of high-quality organs would enter the system,” says Veale. “For the first time in history we could actually start reducing the waiting list .”  But Joy Riley of the Tennessee Center for Bioethics and Culture says she is sceptical of a system that relies on “trusting in a piece of paper with no guarantees” . Though the scheme has been approved by the medical board of the National Kidney Registry and is now offered in 30 hospitals, Riley says she would like to see a “national conversation” before the scheme is rolled out further.

New simulations suggest that if a super-Earth existed in our own solar system, say between Venus and the Earth, far more asteroids would collide with us. But that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, if the timing is right.  Understanding the effect of these massive planets on others nearby could help direct the search for life on exoplanets. Advertisement  Given that our galaxy is overrun with Super-Earths , Jeremy Smallwood at the University of Nevada and his colleagues set out to discover what their effect might be on neighbouring worlds, and what role one might play in a planet’s habitability.  They ran simulations of the inner solar system’s formation, shuffling the theoretical super-Earth around. They discovered that a super-Earth closer to the sun than we are would increase the number of asteroid impacts on our planet, while a super-Earth outside Earth’s orbit would have the opposite effect. Why? A super-Earth near our sun would causes an asteroid’s orbit to stretch out, making a collision with Earth more likely. A Game of Goldilocks  It may seem that the system with fewer asteroid impacts would be more conducive to life – but many astronomers argue the opposite.  “ Asteroid collisions are thought to be destructive for life – that was definitely true for the dinosaurs,” says Smallwood’s PhD advisor Rebecca Martin . “But they are also essential for life.”  Take Earth’s climate as an example. When our planet first formed, its orbit was eccentric – it might zip close to the sun for a short period and then spend long stretches of time in the cold outer regions of the solar system. But asteroid impacts helped to dampen these eccentricities and making our planet’s orbit more circular, making the climate more stable.  Astronomers also argue that the building blocks of life, like water, arrived on the first asteroids. In fact, the Earth’s water is a chemical match for the asteroid belt’s water, says Sean Raymond at the University of Bordeaux. Asteroids also might have sent heavier elements – like the iron that runs through our veins – toward the early Earth as well.  Some scientists even suggest that life itself could have hitched a lift on these early asteroids, jumping from one planet to the next.  Still an asteroid impact is a double-edged sword. A large impact might sterilise a planet, leaving it inhospitable for years to come. Raymond says that a planet needs a balance between too many asteroid impacts and too few. Smallwood calls this idea a new “goldilocks zone” for habitability.  Still, if astronomers discovered two exoplanetary systems – one where a super-Earth orbited inside that of a planet like our own, and one where a super-Earth orbited outside an Earth-like planet’s orbit – Smallwood would search for life in the first system. Sure, he’s taking a chance that the planet might be sterile. But the other world might not have received the necessary ingredients for life in the first place.

The US was insisting that North Korea scale down its nuclear programme, and this, said Kim In-ryong, had created a situation in which “thermonuclear war may break out at any moment”.  It was not the first time such warmongering talk had come from North Korean diplomats, but concerns over nuclear war have rarely been higher. Donald Trump has warned of a “major, major conflict” with the country.  On the face of it, such tensions might seem to bolster the case for maintaining a nuclear deterrent in the West. Recent arguments in the UK in particular about replacing the ageing submarines that carry the country’s Trident nuclear missiles are part of that wider debate. The new nuclear race: Is there a nuclear war in our future? We round-up the latest news and opinion on the world’s nuclear superpowers, and look at how we can prevent disaster  But what if those submarines are lame ducks? A rumour has circulated since the cold war that subs, often considered the epitome of military stealth, can in fact be tracked. If that’s true, and there are fresh hints that it could be, it overturns an opinion that has largely held sway among military analysts for nearly 50 years – and changes the terms of debates about nuclear deterrence entirely.  It was the 1960 book The Strategy of Conflict by economist Thomas Schelling that put forward the first rigorous analysis of strategies for preventing nuclear war.

The Guajataca Dam is located on the Rio Guajataca in the north-west corner of Puerto Rico. The 90-year-old earthen dam houses a reservoir, 4 square kilometres in area and 4 kilometres long, which stores almost 40 billion litres of water. The reservoir is full to bursting, after Maria dumped 40 centimetres of rain on the surrounding mountains.  If the dam fails, it could cause life-threatening flash flooding downstream. Advertisement  Since Friday, when the crack appeared, local officials have been warning of the danger and managing an evacuation. “We don’t know how long it’s going to hold,” Governor Ricardo Rosselló told the media on Sunday . “The integrity of the structure has been compromised in a significant way.”  Up to 70,000 people are being evacuated from the area. Dam experts contacted by New Scientist were full of praise for the evacuation plan. Dam bottom eroding  “Photographs of the incident show there’s structural damage at the base of the dam’s spillway, where overflows appear to be eroding the bottom of the dam,” says Tracey Williamson , chairman of the British Dam Society. Similar incidents and near misses have happened before. “Depending on whether the overflow continues or increases for a significant amount of time, there’s a possibility that erosion could progress to the point where the dam could breach.”  There are several ways to stop the dam bursting. One is to reduce the reservoir level by draining water through all other available outlets: this would relieve the water pressure on the dam and slow the flow of water over the spillway. Another approach is to deploy high-volume pumps to divert the overflow around the zone of erosion. Finally, relief workers could jam additional material into the existing crack to prevent further erosion.  The crisis has also further depleted Puerto Rico’s power supply, as the Guajataca lake supplies hydroelectric power as well as drinking water.  As of Sunday, the US Federal Emergency Management Agency had supplied Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands with 1.5 million meals, 1.1 million litres of water and 12,000 emergency roofing kits .

Today the world’s first low-cost wearable air quality sensor is for sale, capable of monitoring your exposure to the three most harmful pollutants.  The “Flow” device can be used as a handheld sensor or attached to pushchairs, purses and bags. It can be bought worldwide for under $200.  The sensor was tested by 100 volunteers this summer in central London. The crowdsourced results are now being used to map the air quality of more than 2000 kilometres of the city’s pavements. “We want to help people take ownership of what they breathe,” says Romain Lacombe, the CEO of Plume Labs , the Paris-based firm behind the device. Advertisement  “It will certainly be the most complete,” says Jean-François Doussin at Val-de-Marne University in Paris, who has advised Plume. A few similar devices are already on sale, but Flow will be the first to be able to detect levels of the big three pollutants: volatile compounds, airborne particulates and nitrogen oxides . The device tells you whether they exceed safe levels on the street or in your home .  Plume’s sensors will work with a free mobile app to create pollution maps the same way we can now monitor traffic jams on our smartphones . These won’t just rely on readings made by its users. Instead, air quality data will be melded with information on wind flow, temperature and other variables to forecast pollution hotspots. This could benefit those most at risk from bad air : young children, joggers and people with asthma and cardiovascular illnesses, whose lives may be endangered on heavily polluted days. Stay-at-home day  Giving people precise information about their exposure will let them change their daily routine. For example, the parents of young children might decide to stay at home on high pollution days, joggers could take a different route or people with asthma could keep the windows open when they are cooking or using indoor fireplaces.  Air pollution levels have been falling in many cities in Europe and the US as regulations governing vehicle exhaust and other emissions tighten. But Frederica Perera at Columbia University in New York says city dwellers should still be concerned. “Our studies and those of other researchers have found no convincing evidence of a pollution threshold or safe level of exposure to common urban air pollutants,” she says. Having a map of pollution hotspots means you can avoid them Plume Labs  Until recently, cities depended on a few fixed monitors to track air quality over vast urban areas. But these offered little insight to the average person because pollution varies from block to block due to the effects of trees, traffic patterns and architecture.  Rising concerns about the health effects of pollution, plus recent breakthroughs in sensing technology have spawned an explosion of cheap, portable monitoring devices.  But while many of these have launched over the past few years, the few that remain on the market only monitor one class of pollutants. That is largely due to space and data processing constraints, says Doussin. Street-level pollution maps  Recent technological developments include nanowire gas sensors built into microchips in the Flow device. These are small enough to enable sensors for three key pollution components to be crammed into the device.  The Flow is one of a range of efforts to make high-resolution street-level pollution maps. The “Biking and Breathing” project in New York is now strapping wearable monitors on cyclists who volunteered to assess the health effects of biking around the city’s streets.  Small mobile sensors have also been mounted on drones and balloons, and even pigeons to create 3D models of how plumes of pollution move through urban areas. This is all designed to give researchers “a new, hyperlocal understanding of pollution”, says Melissa Lunden of Aclima , an air monitoring company working with Google to track pollution in several Californian communities using equipment mounted on Google Street View cars.  Lunden hopes these new readings will give governments a tool to evaluate the impact of projects such as electrified bus lines, bike lanes and adding green space in congested urban cores.  Doussin says smaller sensors like Flow are less accurate than the equipment scientists use, but they are “more than sufficient to evaluate personal exposure to air pollution”.  He hopes that future versions of the device will detect ozone too and that the current sensor will create pressure on local officials to get serious about cleaning up the air. “The problem that we have with air quality is that it is an invisible problem,” he says. “These devices make the invisible visible.”  More on these topics:",,,english,,,persons,richar,negative,null,2017-09-26T17:15:09.000+03:00,,,,

Now there are strains of wheat that do not produce the forms of gluten that trigger a dangerous immune reaction in as many as 1 in 100 people.  Because the new strains still contain some kinds of gluten, though, the wheat can still be used to bake bread. “It’s regarded as being pretty good, certainly better than anything on the gluten-free shelves,” says Jan Chojecki of PBL-Ventures in the UK, who is working with investors in North America to market products made with this wheat.  Gluten is the general term for all the proteins in wheat and related cereals . During baking, these proteins link up to form elastic chains, which is what holds breads and cakes together as they rise. Advertisement  But some people have an autoimmune condition called coeliac disease . Their immune systems respond incorrectly to gluten, which damages the gut lining and can lead to diarrhoea, vomiting, malnutrition, brain damage and even gut cancers.  Not all gluten proteins trigger this response, though: the main culprit is a group called gliadins. So Francisco Barro’s team at the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture in Cordoba, Spain, set about getting rid of them. Acceptable bread  They used a genetic modification technique to remove 90 per cent of the gliadins in wheat. They did this by adding genes that trigger a process called RNA interference, which stops specific proteins being made. But because the gliadin genes themselves remain intact, in theory, there is a risk that the wheat could start making the crucial proteins again.  So Barro’s team next tried using CRISPR gene-editing to get rid of the genes entirely. This is a huge task because there are no fewer than 45 copies of the gene for the main gliadin protein that causes problems. Nevertheless, Barro’s team report that they have already managed to knock out 35 of the 45 genes.  More genes need to be disabled before the CRISPR strain is ready for testing, but it should be worth all the effort: the team have already shown that the GM wheat strain makes an acceptable bread. It cannot be used for making large sliced loafs, but is good enough for baguettes and rolls, says Chojecki.  “Some people will be very happy with this,” says Sarah Sleet, head of patients’ group Coeliac UK, not least because sticking to a gluten-free diet is difficult.  However, others may not want to eat genetically modified foods, or to take the risk that some immune-triggering components remain in the wheat, Sleet says.  Small trials of the GM wheat involving 10 and 20 people with coeliac disease are already being carried out in Mexico and Spain. “All I can say is that the results are very encouraging,” says Chojecki.

Evaporating water could supply enormous volumes of clean electricity, if we can only harness it.  Evaporation is the process by which liquids turn into gases, generally when they are heated up. Every day, vast amounts of water evaporate from lakes and rivers, powered by heat energy from the sun. The scale of this energy is considerable.  Water that evaporates from existing lakes and dams in the US – excluding the Great Lakes – could provide up to 2.85 billion megawatt hours of electricity per year, according to Ozgur Sahin of Columbia University and colleagues. That is the equivalent of two-thirds of US electricity generation in 2015. In 15 of the 47 US states studied, the potential power exceeds demand. Advertisement  Covering freshwater bodies with engines that harness evaporation would halve water lost in this way, the team says. In seven US states, this would save more water than the entire state consumes. But the calculations assume that all the water is covered – which we would not want to do.  Evaporation engines could also be put in other areas, from irrigated fields and greenhouses to sheltered bays, says Sahin.  But first an evaporation engine needs to be built. Sahin’s team has created several miniature prototypes.  The prototypes are all based on materials that shrink as they dry, such as tape coated with bacterial spores. The spores curl as they dry, shortening the tape. “They work like a muscle,” says Sahin. “They can push and pull with a lot of force.”  To avoid being repeatedly soaked in water and becoming contaminated with dirt and chemicals, the prototypes exploit changes in humidity .  In one version, the “muscle” sits just above the water. When shutters above it are closed, the humidity rises and the material expands. That opens the shutters, allowing the material to dry out and shrink, and so on.  Such evaporation engines can run at night as well as day. Normally, there would be less evaporation at night, but blocking evaporation during the day stores energy in the form of warm water. “At night you take advantage of this power,” says Sahin. “This is a great advantage.” Engine problems  Others agree that the potential is huge. The issue is harnessing it .  “The question is whether there is any practical way to capture that energy,” says Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, California. He doubts it is possible to efficiently convert evaporation energy into electrical energy.  What’s more, developing evaporation engines to the point where they can be mass-produced is a huge task, and one that few groups are working on.  The technology would also have to compete directly with solar panels, as it is increasingly common for floating solar farms to be placed on reservoirs. But evaporation engines could be made from cheap biological materials that are easier to dispose of than solar panels, says Sahin.  If the technology does take off in a big way, it could affect local weather by reducing evaporation. But it will only make a difference if an area of 250,000 square kilometres is covered, the team calculates. At large scales, all forms of energy production, from wind to nuclear, can affect weather and climate .  Besides, in a world of increasingly extreme rainfall, reducing evaporation could be desirable in some places.

By doing so they catch more food while expending less energy.  African penguins were believed to forage in groups, but nobody had ever seen them hunt underwater. To find out how they catch common fish in their habitat, like schools of sardines and anchovies, Alistair McInnes of Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, South Africa, and colleagues attached cameras to 12 of the birds.  On most dives the penguins pursued single fish, but sometimes they teamed up for bigger rewards. Groups of penguins were seen herding schools of fish towards the surface, corralling them into a “bait ball”. Any fish trying to escape would peel off from the group, making them easy prey. The penguins’ plumage – black on the back, white at the front – probably makes it difficult for the fish to see them coming from below. Advertisement  The researchers calculated how efficient the penguins were by dividing the number of fish caught by the time spent foraging. When hunting a school of fish as a group, penguins were 2.7 times as efficient as when they attacked on their own.

At the simplest level, animals like swordfish collaborate to slash at fish with their bills , killing more fish this way. At a more sophisticated level, creatures like dolphins communicate and coordinate their activity .  Penguins aren’t cooperating like dolphins, but they may be more advanced than swordfish, says McInnes. At the surface, they communicate to find other birds and synchronise their dives.  “This study provides the first evidence that penguins are actively interacting with other individuals to enhance hunting efficiency,” says Yuuki Watanabe at the National Institute of Polar Research, Japan. He says other penguins may do the same, but we don’t have evidence yet.  African penguins are an endangered species – the wild population has fallen over 60 per cent since the 1970s . Overfishing of their prey is thought to be a factor.  It’s likely that this decline will make it harder for the remaining penguins to get enough food, says McInnes. “If they benefit from group foraging and there are less birds at sea, it’s harder to find other penguins to benefit them when they’re foraging.” Journal reference: Royal Society Open Science , DOI: 10.1098/rsos.170918  More on these topics:",,,english,,,persons,peter verhoog,negative,null,2017-09-27T03:21:28.002+03:00,,,,

A technique that turns mouse brains transparent has given us the most detailed view yet of how stroke cuts off the blood supply in the brain.  Stroke damages the brain’s blood vessels, stopping oxygen and nutrients reaching cells. To understand this impact, researchers usually examine thin brain slices under the microscope.  Now Dirk Hermann and Matthias Gunzer at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany and their team have developed a way to see all of a brain’s blood vessels clearly, without having to slice it up. They injected a fluorescent gel into the hearts of mice, waited for it to be pumped around the body, and then removed the brains and soaked them in chemicals. “You’re left with a brain that is clear like glass,” says Hermann. Advertisement  The team looked at each brain under a microscope, lighting up the fluorescent gel using a laser ( Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism , doi.org/cdg3 ).  The brains of mice that had experienced a stroke provided the first-ever 3D view of how stroke cuts off the blood supply to parts of the brain. “You could see which capillaries had died and how the surviving ones were reorganising themselves,” says Gunzer.

Pictured above, it was thought to be an introduced species and plans were afoot to wipe it out. Now it turns out to be a species unique to the island, one that should be conserved.  The cobra-preta, as local people call it (the name is Portuguese for “black snake”), lives on São Tomé in the Gulf of Guinea. The people also have a saying about it: homem mordido, homem perdido , or “man bitten, man lost”.  The cobra-preta was long thought to be the forest cobra ( Naja melanoleuca ), a black snake with a mottled white collar, found in mainland Africa. Regarded as the largest cobra in the world, the forest cobra can reach 3 metres in length. Advertisement  The story was that Portuguese farmers introduced the cobra-preta to São Tomé to control rats. This seemed odd to Luis Ceríaco of Villanova University in Pennsylvania. “Why would you introduce the deadliest snake in Africa to an island?” he asks. Read more: Four-legged fossil holds secret of snake’s slithering origins  Ceríaco found a report from 1540, which included an account of a visit to São Tomé by a Portuguese explorer in 1506, when it was being colonised. The explorer described a black snake that was “so venomous that when it bites a man, his eyes will explode out of the head and he will die”. That was undoubtedly the cobra-preta, Ceríaco says, albeit depicted with eye-popping hyperbole. Mariana Marques  When Ceríaco (pictured above with a forest cobra) looked closely at cobra-pretas, he found they tended to be even larger than forest cobras and that the scales on their underside had far less white. Genetic analysis confirmed that the cobra-preta is a new species, one Ceríaco has named Naja peroescobari .  “It’s pretty incredible,” says Ceríaco. “It’s like discovering a new crocodile… It doesn’t happen every day.” Read more: Snakes outpacing other invertebrates in race to evolve  The discovery came at the right time, says Ceríaco. São Tomé is becoming more conservation-conscious and the cobra-preta could have been earmarked for eradication, since it did not appear to be a native species. Locals already target and kill the snakes because of their deadly bites, Ceríaco says. Some, however, catch and eat them as a delicacy.  “I think it says a lot that the type specimen, which is considered the gold standard in taxonomic research, is a snake that was chopped in half by a local resident of São Tomé,” says Rayna Bell of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, who has worked on São Tomé. “Clearing up the misconception that the cobra-preta doesn’t belong on São Tomé will be an important first step towards conserving these unique snakes.” Journal reference: Zootaxa , DOI: 10.11646/zootaxa.4324.1.7  More on these topics: ",,,english,,,persons,tiziano,negative,null,2017-09-27T15:59:44.000+03:00,,,,

Of all possible hominins found so far in Africa, S. tchadensis is the most ancient, at about 7 million years old . Officially, it is known only from a handful of fossils found in Chad in 2001: a few teeth, parts of two lower jaws and, most importantly, a single, relatively complete skull.  Features at the skull’s rear suggest it sat atop a vertical spine like that of a human, hinting that S. tchadensis walked upright. To make sure, other fossils will be needed – particularly from the legs. Unconfirmed reports suggest that a thigh bone was found with the skull , but this has not yet been discussed in a scientific paper. With so little evidence to go on, some are sceptical that S. tchadensis can really yet be defined as a hominin rather than some other form of ape – yet.  Orrorin tugenensis : the thighbone’s connected to the…?  Discovered in western Kenya , largely in 2000, O. tugenensis is officially known from a baker’s dozen of fossils , six of which are teeth. The others include a finger bone, two jaw fragments, parts of three thighbones and a fragment of an upper arm bone. Most research has focused on one of the thighbones, and whether it shows that O. tugenensis walked upright on two legs like other hominins. Many argue that it was at least beginning to become bipedal . More fossil evidence could settle the matter.  Kenyanthropus platyops : a face for toolmaking?  Unearthed in 3.3-million-year-old deposits in north-west Kenya, mostly in 1998 and 1999, K. platyops is best known from a mostly complete but squashed and distorted skull . A few dozen other fossil fragments were found at the same time – mostly teeth, but also pieces of a second skull, and parts of a few upper and lower jaws.  Although all the K. platyops fossils found so far come from above the neck, very primitive stone tools were later found in the same rocks . K. platyops might have made these, but one researcher has suggested that the toolmaker could instead have been a hominin called Australopithecus deyiremeda – another enigmatic species known from no more than a few jaw fragments .  Homo rudolfensis : is it even a species?  Most researchers believe that our human genus emerged in Africa between 2 and 3 million years ago – but there is no agreement on how many species of early human shared the landscape. Homo rudolfensis sits at the centre of the controversy.  For decades, H. rudolfensis was known only from a distinctive 1.9-million-year-old large-brained, flat-faced skull discovered in 1972 in Kenya . Three additional face and jaw fossils found in Kenya between 2007 and 2009 helped confirm to some researchers that the 1972 skull really did belong to a distinct species – but others (including Lee Berger, discoverer of A. sediba and H. naledi ) are sceptical.  Even the species name is controversial: it was established in the late 1970s by a Russian researcher not involved in the discovery of the 1972 skull. The researchers who analysed the three more recently found fossils say we need more fossil material before we can confirm whether the H. rudolfensis name is valid – or whether the species really belongs in our human genus .  Denisovans: last and definitely least  From a fossil perspective, Denisovans are the least-known of all ancient hominins. To date, just four tiny fossils have been confirmed as belonging to them – three teeth and one finger bone, all between 50,000 and 225,000 years old.  All four fossils, which came from the Denisova cave in Siberia, preserved enough DNA to confirm that they belong to the same genetic pool. This gene pool was distinct from that of the other two hominins – Neanderthals and our species – known to have been in Eurasia in the last several tens of thousands of years. Two fragmentary ancient human skulls excavated in China between 2007 and 2014 might have belonged to Denisovans, but unless they yield DNA, we will probably not know for sure.

The observation comes on the tail of rumours of a possible detection of neutron stars merging , which could cause gravitational waves we can observe on Earth. But that’s not what they found.  On 14 August, the Virgo detector and the two US detectors that make up the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) all observed the ripples in space-time caused by two black holes smashing into each other and merging.  This is the fourth gravitational wave detection ever. All four have come from pairs of black holes spiraling towards one another and then colliding, their colossal masses warping space-time as they merge. Like its forerunner, LIGO, Virgo spotted its first gravitational wave shortly after it began taking data. Advertisement Back to black holes  The black holes that caused this latest round of gravitational waves were 31 and 25 times the mass of the sun before they merged, making this the second largest collision we’ve detected this way. They are located about 1.8 billion light years away from Earth in the direction of the constellation Eridanus in the southern sky.  “Three detectors is not just a little bit better than two; it gives us radically better information about the location of the source and what’s going on with the source,” says Kenneth Strain, a member of the LIGO collaboration at the University of Glasgow. “The numbers we can get now are much more precise than before.”  Researchers have been able to narrow down the location of this new gravitational wave, called GW170814, to an area of 60 square degrees in the sky. That’s 300 times the area of the full moon viewed from the surface of the Earth. It may still seem like a large expanse, but the addition of Virgo allows scientists to triangulate the location of a signal. In this case, they have been able to narrow the possible regions of sky that could host the source of the gravitational waves by 10 times more than with LIGO alone.  “This is just the beginning of observations with the network enabled by Virgo and LIGO working together,” said LIGO spokesperson David Shomaker . “With the next observing run planned for fall 2018 we can expect such detections weekly or even more often.” ",,,english,,,persons,virgo,none,null,2017-09-27T21:04:05.020+03:00,,,,

By Leah Crane  A lab-made cloud has thrown light on a mysterious rain-creating phenomenon first witnessed decades ago.  Atmospheric scientists haven’t fully understood the mechanism by which a single cold droplet or ice shard can trigger abrupt rain or snowfall – as it did in an experiment in the 1940s when scientists dropped chunks of dry ice from an aeroplane through cumulus clouds.  Now, Prasanth Prabhakaran at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in Germany and his colleagues have used an artificial cloud in a box to simulate the phenomenon, finding that a falling drop of cold water can trigger the growth of minuscule droplets along its path. Advertisement  In real clouds, water drops generally grow by sticking to aerosol particles. But Prabhakaran and his colleagues created artificial clouds in which liquid droplets at high pressure can grow on their own without the need for any aerosols, whose addition would also have made the cloud difficult to model. Make it rain  To further simplify the experiment, the researchers used two chemical stand-ins. Helium took the part of nitrogen and other gases, while sulphur hexafluoride played the role of atmospheric water, because it can be both a liquid and a vapour, and it forms droplets at lower temperatures and pressures than water. The cloud was created in a special box with a heated bottom and a top that was 4 ° C cooler.  Some sulphur hexafluoride formed a pool at the bottom of the box, while some evaporated into the helium gas above. Drops of sulphur hexafluoride condensed on the ceiling of the box and dropped back down through the gaseous cloud.  Because the drops had formed on the cooled top of the box, they were colder than the surrounding gas. As a drop fell , it cooled the area around it. That caused lots of “microdroplets” to form in its wake, just as condensation forms on a cold can when it comes into contact with warmer air.  Prabhakaran and his colleagues say this mechanism could help explain some abrupt rainstorms. Depending on atmospheric conditions, microdroplets produced this way in real clouds could merge until they are big enough to fall as a raindrop, or be swept into an updraft and then create microdroplets of their own. In the clouds  But because clouds have turbulent flows of air and varying temperatures, and because they contain particles of different sizes, it is tough to tell how realistic this model is.  “I see little relevance of this study to real-world clouds,” says Daniel Rosenfeld at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. Because the artificial cloud is so small, the processes that happen there may not scale up to the size of actual clouds in Earth’s atmosphere , he says.  Jonathan Crosier at the University of Manchester, UK, says if this is what happens in real clouds, it may be a rare phenomenon.  “I’m not convinced it’s an important process in terms of understanding how 99.9 per cent of the droplets in a cloud are formed,” he says. “However, to really know, detailed simulations are needed in a very wide range of scenarios.” Journal reference: Physical Review Letters , DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.128701 ",,,english,,,,,,null,2017-09-27T21:04:10.010+03:00,,,,

Now there are strains of wheat that do not produce the forms of gluten that trigger a dangerous immune reaction in as many as 1 in 100 people.  Because the new strains still contain some kinds of gluten, though, the wheat can still be used to bake bread. “It’s regarded as being pretty good, certainly better than anything on the gluten-free shelves,” says Jan Chojecki of PBL-Ventures in the UK, who is working with investors in North America to market products made with this wheat.  Gluten is the general term for all the proteins in wheat and related cereals. During baking, these proteins link up to form elastic chains, which is what holds breads and cakes together as they rise. Advertisement  But some people have an autoimmune condition called coeliac disease . Their immune systems respond incorrectly to gluten, which damages the gut lining and can lead to diarrhoea, vomiting, malnutrition, brain damage and even gut cancers.  Not all gluten proteins trigger this response, though: the main culprit is a group called gliadins. So Francisco Barro’s team at the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture in Cordoba, Spain, set about getting rid of them.  They used a genetic modification technique to remove 90 per cent of the gliadins in wheat. They did this by adding genes that trigger a process called RNA interference, which stops specific proteins being made. But because the gliadin genes themselves remain intact, in theory, there is a risk that the wheat could start making the crucial proteins again.  So Barro’s team next tried using CRISPR gene-editing to get rid of the genes entirely. This is a huge task because there are no fewer than 45 copies of the gene for the main gliadin protein that causes problems. Nevertheless, Barro’s team report that they have already managed to knock out 35 out of the 45 genes ( Plant Biotechnology Journal, doi.org/cdfd ). “It cannot be used for making large sliced loafs, but is good enough for baguettes and rolls”  More genes need to be disabled before the CRISPR strain is ready for testing, but it should be worth all the effort: the team have already shown that the GM wheat strain makes an acceptable bread. It cannot be used for making large sliced loafs, but is good enough for baguettes and rolls, says Chojecki.  “Some people will be very happy with this,” says Sarah Sleet, head of patients’ group Coeliac UK, not least because sticking to a gluten-free diet is difficult.  However, others may not want to eat genetically modified foods , or to take the risk that some immune-triggering components remain in the wheat, Sleet says.  Small trials of the GM wheat involving 10 and 20 people with coeliac disease are already being carried out in Mexico and Spain. “All I can say is that the results are very encouraging,” says Chojecki.

Pau Barrena/Bloomberg via Getty Images By Chris Baraniuk  THERE’S a new way to prove you are who you say you are – inspired by the tech underpinning bitcoin. Usually, when you need to verify your identity, the process is archaic, insecure and time-consuming. You get a copy of your birth certificate in the post, put it in an envelope and hope it gets to whoever is asking for it. In the digital era, this should take seconds.  But putting something as sensitive as a birth certificate online risks identity theft in the era of hacks and leaks. Now, the US state of Illinois is experimenting with a secure way of putting control of that data into its citizens’ hands, with the help of distributed ledgers, similar to the blockchain used by bitcoin.  Just last month, Illinois announced a pilot project to create “secure ‘self-sovereign’ identity” for Illinois citizens wishing to access their birth certificate. The idea is to use a blockchain-like distributed ledger that allows online access only to the people owning the ID, and any third parties granted their permission. Advertisement  Illinois is working with software firm Evernym of Herriman, Utah, to create a record of who should be able to access data from the state’s birth register. Once this is done, no central authority should be required , just your say-so.  They’re not the only ones. According to a report by Garrick Hileman and Michael Rauchs at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, UK, governments are increasingly experimenting with it, including the UK and Brazil.  Activists have long called for people to have greater control of their data . Hacks and leaks are making it too risky for authorities to be the central repository of citizens’ most vital information.  With distributed ledgers, all participants within a network can have their own identical copy of data like access permissions – so no one can view cryptographically sealed birth certificate data unless they’re meant to. Blockchains are a type of distributed ledger that gets the whole network to observe and verify transactions – such as when someone sends a bitcoin to their friend.  Distributed ledgers could be a great way to store critical data. But “the devil is always in the details”, says Dave Birch at electronic transactions consultancy Consult Hyperion. Done wrong, distributed ledgers could carve mistakes in stone.  “If your midwife fat-fingers the weight of the child or the name then you’re going to have a typo in your name from birth forever,” says privacy analyst Steve Wilson of Constellation Research. “Bullshit in, bullshit forever.”  Nonetheless, some think these projects are a step towards a world where all data is managed by the individuals who own it. It could backfire on governments, though. Citizens in Catalonia are gearing up for a referendum on independence from Spain, planned for 1 October. It has been termed “illegal” by authorities in Madrid. But a start-up is studying the possibility of using blockchain technology to let citizens hold their own vote, with no government authority needed.

But as many of us probably know, it can be hard to lose weight in this area. Now it seems that inflammation of immune cells may be to blame, and we may be able to use drugs to help us burn off our belly flab.  Christina Cammel , of the Yale School of Medicine, and her colleagues have been investigating macrophages – immune cells that normally track down and gobble up pathogens in the body. But as we age, there’s evidence that the macrophages in belly fat become inflamed.  To see what effect this might have, Cammel’s team isolated macrophages from the fat tissue of young and old mice, and sequenced the DNA from these cells. They found that the genomes of the aged macrophages expressed more genes that hinder a group of molecules that spread signals between nerve cells, called catecholamines. Advertisement  The genes do this by activating an enzyme that suppresses these neurotransmitters. The boosted activity of this enzyme in aged immune cells in the belly fat of older mice effectively block signals telling the body that there is fat there that is available to burn for energy.  “We found [that] macrophages in belly fat interfere with signals in a way that’s new to us,” says Cammel.  Antidepressant effect  When the action of a receptor that is involved in the inflammation of immune cells was dampened-down, they found that neurotransmitter signals returned to normal and older mice were able to burn belly fat as rapidly as younger mice after a 24-hour fasting period.  A drug was then used to mess with the enzyme, lots of which was found in aged immune cells. Blocking this enzyme had a similar effect, and older mice were able to burn off the fat around their middle again.  The drug used is a common antidepressant called clorgyline, which is given to some people because low levels of catecholamine have been linked to symptoms of depression.  But we don’t know yet if people taking this drug get any positive side effects on their waistlines. It may be tricky to find out, says Cammel, because the drug also causes changes in appetite. How it does this is unclear – there’s evidence of the drug both boosting and decreasing appetite in people.  In any case, the findings are promising. They have shown that it’s possible to manipulate inflammation and fat metabolism in laboratory animals, says Matt Kaeberlein , at the University of Washington, in Seattle. “There’s no biological reason to think this will be more difficult in humans.”  Journal reference: Nature , DOI: 10.1038/nature24022",,,english,,,persons,matt kaeberlein,none,null,2017-09-27T21:18:57.003+03:00,,,,

DENNIS KUNKEL MICROSCOPY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY By Andy Coghlan  Transplants grown from stem cells in the lab can help replenish the blood and have been used to cure anaemia in mice. The discovery could lead to treatments for people with anaemia caused by kidney disease.  In the US, 30 million people have chronic kidney disease . Because the kidney makes erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that triggers the production of red blood cells, people whose kidneys degenerate can develop anaemia – not having enough red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body.  EPO, which has notoriously been used as a doping agent in competitive sports, can be produced commercially and used as an anaemia treatment, but it is expensive. Such treatment requires a person to undergo at least three infusions of EPO a week, which is impractical for many, and the treatment can sometimes cause heart problems.  Now researchers have made cells that produce EPO instead, and used them to treat mice. The team did this using stem cells from human cord blood, inducing them to become pluripotent stem cells capable of becoming any type of cell. By treating these with various growth factors, they were able to coax them into becoming cells that make EPO. Smart cells  The team then transplanted these cells into the kidney cavities of mice with a form of kidney anaemia. Within four weeks, EPO levels in the blood of treated animals were 20-fold higher than in controls.  “Just one transplant of the human EPO-producing cells treated kidney anaemia in mice, keeping their haemoglobin levels in the normal range for the remaining 7-month lifespan of the animals,” says Kenji Osafune , of Kyoto University in Japan, who led the team.  “This is a very clever strategy that exploits ‘smart cells’ as factories for therapeutic proteins,” says George Daley of Boston Children’s Hospital. “Cells have the capacity to regulate protein production to suit demand, and offer considerable advantages over periodic injections of therapeutic proteins,” he said.

A tiny transforming robot can put on special exoskeleton outfits tailor-made to help it complete different activities, including walking, rolling, sailing and gliding. This could one day be used as a blueprint for mini robotic surgeons or explorers.  Each exoskeleton starts out as a sheet of plastic onto which the robot, known as Primer, rolls. Heat is then applied to cause the exoskeleton to fold around the robot in a motion akin to a piece of origami assembling itself. The folds are created by lines cut into the sheet of plastic, with their depths responsible for the angle of fold.  The exoskeletons allow the robot to adapt to different situations. One gives it the ability to roll, meaning it can move twice as fast as without the exoskeleton; another is shaped like a boat, letting it float on water and carry nearly twice its weight. It even has a glider-shaped exoskeleton that allows it to soar when falling from a height. Advertisement  via GIPHY . Credit: MIT/CSAIL  Primer itself is only a couple of centimetres in size and is controlled by an external magnetic field. Once it has finished with a particular exoskeleton, it can ditch the covering by dipping itself in water. Mini surgeons and explorers  “In the future, we imagine robots like this could become mini surgeons, squished into a pill that you swallow ,” says Daniela Rus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Once in the stomach, the tiny surgeons could use different exoskeletons to cut tissue samples or deliver medicine – applications that are still a long way off, but could have many advantages. “Some aspects of surgery could be done without incisions, pain, or infection,” says Rus.  The robots could also be used for exploration tasks, or monitoring abandoned warehouses, says Jamie Paik at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. “This is a great example of how origami robots can take on diverse tasks using different clothing, meaning that you can mould the robot to different situations,” she says.

A craft that began with nothing more than a lens and a photosensitive plate has turned into an art that involves a vast array of image-capturing devices that allow us to see far beyond the limitations of our own eyes.  Few have made more comprehensive creative use of these devices than Ruff, whose works have anticipated and riffed off key developments in photography over the past 40 years, from ubiquitous surveillance to face-swapping apps. In the 1980s, for example, he blew passport-style headshots up to colossal proportions that shockingly revealed every detail of his sitters’ features – detail that can now be captured by anyone with a high-resolution smartphone camera. Extreme close-up Woman Portrait, Porträt (P Stadtbäumer), 1988, C-print 210×165cm © Thomas Ruff  But it was those portraits that soured Ruff on conventional photography: he disliked the sense that he had staged the images to be “the view into Big Brother’s camera”, as he says at the opening of a retrospective of his works at London’s Whitechapel Gallery. So for his next project, Sterne , he set out to take “the most objective photograph possible”, procuring deep-field images of the night sky from the European Southern Observatory. Ruff, who says he struggled to choose between studying astronomy and art, cropped those images and created monochrome compositions that loom over the viewer with a kind of chilly grandeur. Advertisement  The realisation that he lacked the equipment or skills to take such pictures himself liberated Ruff to make use of other archive and found images, ranging from internet porn to decontextualised newswire pictures. His reworks invite the viewer to reflect on the production and uses of such images, often taken for granted. Nonetheless, an artist reconfiguring astronomical images might raise hackles: aren’t they self-evidently beautiful already? The most-objective photograph possible? Dark Sky, 16h 30m / -50°, 1989, C-print 260×188cm © Thomas Ruff  For a more recent series, ma.r.s. , Ruff took images from the HiRISE instrument mounted on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the most powerful camera ever sent to another planet. The HiRISE team haven’t been bashful about promoting the beauty of their images themselves, turning them into a popular Twitter stream and a coffee-table book. But for Ruff, “colour in space doesn’t exist, it’s nonsense”. The colours in the official HiRISE images don’t represent what human eyes would see; introducing colour to space-probe imagery has become a rather competitive hobby for online enthusiasts. Alien colours Mars, ma.r.s. 01_III, 2011, C-print 255×185cm © Thomas Ruff  So Ruff added his own colours to the raw HiRISE images – sometimes conforming to what was known of the Martian landscape, sometimes according to his own whim. “There are no green sands on Mars,” he laughs: the features in many of his pictures aren’t what we would see even if we viewed them with our own eyes. The photographic prosthesis can take us only so far. “But aliens could have completely different access to the electromagnetic spectrum,” he says. “So perhaps I’ve also made images for aliens.”  Thomas Ruff: Photographs 1979 – 2017 runs at Whitechapel Gallery , London, until 21 January 2018  More on these topics:",,,english,,,persons,thomas ruff,negative,null,2017-09-28T13:24:53.004+03:00,,,,

Yet there exists a certain type of Silicon Valley outfit that seems destined to upset regulators as a result of the rapid pursuit of getting their technology out there.  This appears to include Uber Technologies – a firm in the vanguard of the sharing and gig economies. Its app-based, dynamically priced taxi-hailing and sharing service has seriously undercut entrenched cab firms the world over, leaving the likes of London’s black-cab drivers apoplectic at the lost business.

Is it safe, and will it work? Stephen Webster/Plainpicture By Sally Adee  I DISCOVER the French bistro tucked into a strip mall that wraps around a parking lot it shares with a hardware shop and a barber. The man I am meeting has asked to come here instead of the clinic because he doesn’t want to do an interview while being transfused.  I am led to a booth where I find him drinking a glass of wine, wearing the blazer-and-T-shirt uniform common among venture capitalists. His youthful looks have an enhanced, slightly uncanny cast, but I am still shocked when he tells me he is 65. To protect his privacy, he chooses to be identified for this article as JR.  JR is a minor celebrity in these parts. It is the fifth time this year that he has flown in from Atlanta to have the treatment. Monterey doesn’t get a lot of traffic from people like him.  You might think of the Californian coast as a homogeneous stretch of sun-drenched sand and rich people. But things change around the middle of the state. Driving there from San Francisco, you quickly lose the sun behind a permanent blanket of fog. The central coast is long and flat, with glimpses of iron grey choppy waves behind squat buildings.  So it’s a bit odd that this is the epicentre of a phenomenon rocking Silicon Valley: young blood treatments. JR is one of about 100 people who have each paid $8000 to join a controversial trial, offering them infusions of blood plasma from donors aged between 16 and 25 in a bid to turn back the clock.

In open air, drones can navigate autonomously using GPS, but these satellite signals don’t penetrate deep underground, meaning robot spelunkers require human pilots.  Ahmed AlNomany and his colleagues at Swedish company Inkonova are working on an alternative. “It’s complicated because we are trying to invent another way of positioning using bits and pieces of technologies,” says AlNomany. Advertisement  Having a view of its surroundings is the first step. Using laser scanners and a technique called SLAM, which calculates the distance between the drone and nearby objects, it will build up a map of its environment. And it can do so quickly.  The company recently used its manually operated drone, TILT Ranger, to map an underground mine in Mali using SLAM. In just 10 minutes, they were able to virtually reconstruct a section of the mine with a volume of roughly 30,000 cubic metres – about a third the size of London’s Royal Albert Hall. “It’s not a big challenge to capture such zones quickly,” says AlNomany. Building a picture  Now the firm’s new autonomous drone can combine its map with additional input from sensors, such as an accelerometer, to position the drone and move without GPS. So far, during preliminary tests, it has been able to stabilise itself on its own in the air.  When it encounters unusually shaped space, it has a backup. Equipped with wheels, the drone can move along the ground and tilt to fly or roll at an angle if needed. “If it is near a wall, the drone will adapt to it and climb it instead of flying,” says AlNomany.  Adriano Mazzini at the University of Oslo in Norway thinks that automated drones are now the ideal choice to explore dangerous environments. “Relatively lightweight and high-performing tools can now be added to them,” he says. He recently sent a drone over the erupting Lusi mud volcano in Java, Indonesia, to sample gas, water and mud – something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.  Inkonova’s drones are of interest for other GPS-deprived environments too. The company was recently contacted to map a decommissioned nuclear plant. However, the mission was aborted through concern that the drone’s propellers would disperse potentially radioactive dust inside. “We didn’t pursue it further, but we would like to adapt Tilt Ranger for this purpose,” says AlNomany.

There may be an alternative Image Source/REX/Shutterstock By Michael Le Page  A team in Spain is creating strains of wheat that lack the “bad glutens” that trigger the autoimmune disorder coeliac disease . But breads, cakes and pastas made from these strains might also appeal to people with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, and those who think gluten-free diets are healthier.  A small trial in 20 people with “gluten sensitivity” has shown that they can tolerate bread made with this special wheat, says Francisco Barro, at the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture in Cordoba, who is creating the new strains. However, the results from this tiny trial have not been published yet.  What’s more, Barro acknowledges that the idea that some people cannot tolerate gluten is controversial. While a few people do seem to have digestive problems when they eat some foods made from normal wheat, some studies suggest gluten is not the cause . Instead, certain kinds of sugars found in a wide range of foods might be the problem. Advertisement  “There’s a lot of debate in the scientific literature,” says Jan Chojecki of PBL-Ventures in the UK, who hopes to market products made with the coeliac-friendly wheat. “I leave that to the specialists.”  Large numbers of people have also begun avoiding foods containing gluten out of choice. However, there is very little evidence to back the idea that avoiding foods made from normal wheat is healthier. On the contrary, a large study has shown people who avoid gluten eat less healthily and have a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes .  Bearing those risks in mind, switching to “good gluten” wheats really might help those people who eat gluten-free but don’t have any specific gluten-related health problems.

An analysis of more than 20 years of labour automation in Germany found no evidence that robots caused job losses in the country as a whole.  Automation has changed the kinds of work people do, but hasn’t taken jobs away permanently, says Jens Südekum at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf. Although there are plenty of reports that predict future job losses caused by automation, Südekum’s study is only the second to look at how many jobs robots have already taken from us.  The first – a US study published earlier this year – painted a much gloomier picture. Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University found that workplace automation squeezes wages and takes away between three and six jobs per robot. Advertisement  Given that Germany has about eight robots for every thousand workers – four times as many as in the US – Südekum and his colleagues expected to see more job losses there. “Our initial impulse was that it should be much worse in Germany,” he says. So their finding that the country’s workforces have actually faced less of an impact from the worst effects of automation was a surprise.  One reason for this is that while robots have stopped companies creating new jobs in manufacturing – Südekum estimates that 275,000 fewer jobs were created between 1994 and 2014 because of automation – this has been offset by new posts created in other sectors, particularly the service industry.  People that already worked in industries prone to automation, such as the automotive industry, were also more likely to stay employed after robots were introduced into their workplaces. “We don’t see people getting fired,” says Südekum.  It’s not all good news, however. Robots have tended to lead to lower wages in lower and medium-skilled manufacturing jobs, the study found . “Some of the workers do have to swallow wage cuts because of robots,” says Südekum. But for more highly skilled workers and those outside manufacturing, robots had no impact on wages. Shielding the impact  Germany’s unions might be to thank for reducing the impact of automation on jobs, says Südekum, explaining that they are generally more willing to accept wage cuts for workers if it means people keep their jobs.  But Manuel Cebrian at Massachusetts Institute of Technology says that might not be enough to keep people in work in the long run. “We know the only way to ameliorate the problem is through continuing education,” he says. Cebrian co-authored a study that found smaller cities – which tend to have higher proportions of low-skilled workers – will be hit by automation much harder than big ones.  “The major cities are disproportionately attracting the types of jobs that are more resilient to automation,” he says. But he thinks it’s still too early to know whether enough of those jobs are being created to make up for losses in other industries.  Another option, Südekum says, would be to make sure that the benefits of automation – which saves manufacturers money that would otherwise be spent on wages – are shared with all workers. Earlier this week, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the UK’s Labour party , joined Bill Gates in calling for higher taxes on companies that replace human workers with robots .  But Südekum thinks that talk of robots stealing all of jobs is a touch hyperbolic. If the automotive industry is anything to go by, we’re more likely to see a gradual shift in the kinds of jobs that people move into rather than permanent losses, he says. “I just don’t believe the horror stories.”",,,english,,,persons,matt reynolds,none,null,2017-09-28T19:15:12.000+03:00,,,,

Hopkins, Feiyang Chen, Shixue Hu, Zhifei Zhang By Colin Barras  A rare glimpse inside a 510-million-year-old digestive system suggests feeding was a complicated business for the first arthropods. Even this early in animal evolution, some animals had a variety of structures in their gut for storing and processing food.  Arthropods fared especially well following the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago , particularly the now-extinct trilobites , which occupied the oceans for about 270 million years. Advertisement  About 20,000 species of trilobite are known, but only about 40 species preserve any traces of their digestive system.  Melanie Hopkins at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, and Zhifei Zhang at Northwest University in Xi’an, China and colleagues have now added two trilobites to this short list. Gutsy trilobites  Palaeolenus lantenoisi and Redlichia mansuyi lived between 509 and 514 million years ago, and are preserved in the rocks of eastern Yunnan, China. Both are fairly early trilobites, so they should have had simple guts, but no.  Both show evidence of an expanded stomach or “crop” beneath the head shield. This was probably used to store food early in digestion, says Hopkins. It has never been seen in such ancient trilobites.  P. lantenoisi also had a series of paired digestive glands – perhaps for further breakdown of food – running along its alimentary tract.  It’s a combination of features that is virtually unheard-of in trilobites. Many researchers had assumed trilobites either had a crop or digestive glands, but never both.  “I think it is possible that many trilobites had both,” says Hopkins. If a specimen seems to lack one, that might simply be due to poor preservation. Mystery diet  “There was more variation in digestive system anatomy than previously thought,” says Allison Daley at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. “These new findings suggest a great variation in how trilobites processed their food, even as geologically early as in the Cambrian.”  This mirrors the complex feeding behaviours seen in other early animals like the enigmatic anomalocaridids , which looked like a cross between squid and huge woodlice. Seemingly, some targeted specific prey while others were filter feeders .  It would help to know what trilobites ate, but this is “controversial”, says Daley. “It’s been difficult to pinpoint exactly what they ate and how.”  A January 2017 study pointed out that paired digestive glands like those of P. lantenoisi are often found in predatory arthropods today, suggesting trilobites were active predators. But other researchers argue that the trilobite glands seem far simpler than those seen today , so this argument may not hold.  It would be better to infer what they ate from their mouthparts and limbs, says Thomas Hegna at Western Illinois University in Macomb.",,,english,,,,,,null,2017-09-28T21:14:31.000+03:00,,,,

A festival’s search for humanity in AI points to the absence of love – and something even more fundamental Disenchantment Space by Atsushi Tadokoro at the Ars Electronica festival Florian Voggeneder By Gabriel Adheri  A bedridden person lies immobile on a stark white bed. As the camera pans to an almost-lifeless arm, a robot intones with as much care as a clipped, monorhythmic voice can muster: “I am sorry that your family and friends are not able to be here with you. I will do my best to comfort you.”  This is End of Life Care Machine by artist Dan Chen, an interactive installation designed to give visitors a peek at what it might be like as the arms of a robot caress you into your final slumber. As the vital signs tail off barely minutes after meeting, the nameless Charon’s parting words to the dying human are chillier because of their artificial warmth: “Goodbye, my friend”.  The work is part of this year’s Ars Electronica festival in Linz, Austria, with its subtitle Artificial Life: The other I plugging into the present obsession with AI. Advertisement  The documentation for Chen’s installation sits uncomfortably amid remote-controlled dildos and sassy sex robots in the Artificial Intimacy section of the festival’s labyrinthine Post City location – one of 12 sites hosting this far-flung show. Amid these cruder interpretations of, or tools for, artificial intimacy, Chen’s work touches on the theme that runs through the smorgasbord of digital exhibits: the search for our own humanity. End of Life Care Machine by Dan Chen Florian Voggeneder  Surprisingly, alongside the almost obligatory dancing robots and automated sound installations, are tender artworks exploring that most fundamental of emotions – love. Whereas Chen’s work shows us, by its absence, the love that soothes when shuffling off this mortal coil, the Kissenger allows you to kiss anyone you video-call, realistically, via a piece of sensitive oval rubber. This comes complete with pressure sensors and actuators, placed where the mouth would be on both phones. Robotic love  The Homo Digitalis experiment from Christiane Miethge and Nils Otte, on the other hand, takes us through the journey of a female protagonist into a more digital being. One part of her journey involves exploring a relationship with a female sex robot. Captured in a short film, there are hints that the robotic nature of the exploration may be an easier route for our protagonist than if she were encountering a real-life woman in the same way.  Why? The answer may lie in some of the festival’s other installations. In a darkened room, red-lit piles of what looks like rubbish squeak, inviting inspection. Getting closer, the ill-defined shapes jerk into Wall-E -style life. These robots of Rekion Voice , a work by Katsuki Nogami and Taiki Watai, are slaves to human action, mimicking the excitement of whoever triggers them. Perched atop shopping trolleys and air-conditioning units, the cuteness of the robots’ movements is underscored by their dystopian conditions. Rekion Voice by Katsuki Nogami and Taiki Watai Tom Mesic  It’s the positioning of this work with one a few doors down that really brings the point home. Along the corridor is a white room in which stark lighting illuminates a plinth crowned by a dog-fur outfit, including a hood made of the skinned, eyeless face of a nameless hound.  This macabre work – cumbersomely titled Canine TANATOcommerce or the Political-ethical Dilemma of Merchandise / The Bio-unlawfulness of Being: Stray dogs – was fashioned by artist Berenice Olmedo Peña from the corpses of stray dogs killed on the roads of Mexico.  Peña’s art turns our most familiar companion species into a commodity, thereby shining a light on our responsibility for domesticating a species only to abandon and abuse individuals. But more than this, she questions our humanity in the treatment of any “other” over which we have responsibility – be that a dog, a robot slave, or Homo Digitalis ‘s sex robot. Multisensory experience  This bleak face of humanity is offset by Maja Smrekar’s K-9_topology project, which won Ars Electronica’s Golden Nica award for hybrid art. This thoughtful, multisensory work comes from Smrekar’s lifelong relationship with dogs. She uses the tools of biotechnology to explore the chemical and biological aspects of the emotional connection between herself and her canine companions.  Alongside much of the scientific paraphernalia, a huge, fur-lined horn opens at head height. The recycled wolf fur she uses hides a respirator that exudes perfumed serotonin extracted from both artist and dog – a chemical expression of their shared pleasure in each other, the product of thousands of years of co-evolution. K-9_topology by Maja Smrekar Tom Mesic  Treading the thin line between bleak and cute, Japanese musician Etsuko Yakushimaru’s I’m Humanity explores our ongoing efforts to use DNA as a data storage method . This is a double-edged work: there is a possibility that the host bacteria may be able to “evolve” and change Yakushimaru’s bewitchingly catchy J-pop work, but at the same time there is a darker undertone about using living things for our own ends.  Another hot topic – particularly after this year’s raised awareness of the rise of “fake” – is directly addressed by one of the festival’s academic AI projects. Synthesizing Obama: Learning lip sync from audio by Supasorn Suwajanakorn, Steven Seitz and Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman relies on neural networks to create video of the former US president to match audio of his speeches.  Other installations focus on machine learning for image matching. Many act as exposés of the tools, but Closed Loop by Jake Elwes pushes this further. Elwes creates a conversation between a text-only and image-only AI, constantly iterating over interpretations of each other but never quite hitting the mark.  His work is as effective at shining a light on what’s missing in AI as Chen’s artificial carer.  And so, thanks to Ars Electronica, perhaps we can finally see that what’s missing from Artificial Life: The other I is ourselves.  Ars Electronica 2017 ran in Linz, Austria, from 7-11 September  More on these topics:",,,english,,,persons,peña,none,null,2017-09-28T21:14:31.004+03:00,,,,

The company has come up with a strategy for demonstrating quantum supremacy, the claim that quantum computers can perform tasks that no current computers can. While it’s widely assumed that we will eventually reach quantum supremacy, nobody has done it yet because current quantum computers can only run a small number of specialised algorithms.  Their plan is based on simulating coin flips. An ordinary computer does this by storing two numbers and choosing one of them at random each time. To simulate 50 coin tosses, it just selects 50 times in a row.  This is simple with regular coins, but if the coins behave like particles obeying the laws of quantum mechanics, things get more complicated. Advertisement  In that case, we cannot know whether any individual coin turned up heads or tails without knowing about all the other coins, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. The problem of simulating coin tosses with quantum entanglement is called quantum sampling.  Computers work sequentially, so choosing 50 numbers at the same time is not something they can do. For this reason, the Google group argues, quantum sampling would require storing all possible configurations of all 50 coin tosses, so that all of the coins can be thrown simultaneously.  Since one bit – the building block of classical computers – can only store one of two states, heads or tails, covering all possible configurations for 50 coins takes hundreds of terabytes of data storage. Qubit coins  This is where quantum computers come in. They’re based on qubits , which can be in two states at the same time. This makes it possible to store the probability distribution of all the configurations at once using a single qubit for each coin. For this reason, the Google group argues, quantum sampling would be easy for a quantum computer.  In their proposal, the team demonstrates quantum sampling up to nine coins with high accuracy using their 9-qubit quantum computer. “If similar error rates are achievable in future devices with around 50 qubits, we will be able to explore quantum dynamics that are inaccessible otherwise,” the proposal states. This way, quantum computers of the near future can be used to study physics, a huge step-up from their infancy when they couldn’t do anything practical.  The only remaining task, then, is to build a 50-qubit computer . And the team just might, given their track record  “They’ve been delivering many of the expectations,” says Scott Aaronson at the University of Texas in Austin. “The truth is, the Google group has such a strong record that if they say they’re going to do it, people pay attention.”  Indeed, the Google group has completed the necessary preparatory work to build large-scale quantum computers, according to Jacob Taylor of University of Maryland. “They’ve demonstrated that the obvious pitfalls are largely accounted for,” he says. Pick your problem  Not everyone is convinced quantum sampling is the right problem to tackle in order to demonstrate quantum supremacy, though.  “It is unclear whether what they claim to show is quantum supremacy,” says Itay Hen of the University of Southern California. “You have to prove that classical computers can’t do it.”  He says that many important quantum-mechanical systems can be simulated on present-day computers, because it’s not necessary to save all of the information about the system to simulate it.  Proof that this kind of simulation can’t be done on a classical computer may not come anytime soon, but many concepts in this field are accepted as true without formal proof .",,,english,,,,,,null,2017-09-28T21:27:13.000+03:00,,,,

They simply hitched rides on the myriad boats and debris swept up by the massive Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011 .  A marine wildlife census under way since 2012 has now documented 289 species arriving this way, including fish, mussels, barnacles, sea slugs, anemones, sea stars, crabs, clams and sponges – all native to Japanese waters.  Some fish survived for years in water-filled troughs on fishing boats, which somehow avoided overturning. They include banded knifejaws and yellowtail amberjacks , some of them up to 60 centimetres long. Advertisement  “They had just enough food to keep going, but they were pretty emaciated on arrival,” says James Carlton of Williams College in Massachusetts, who set up the census. Since he knew when the tsunami happened, he could tell how long the debris stayed at sea, which stowaways thrived, and how long it took them to reach the US.  Many of the stowaways were adrift for years, clinging to upturned boats, tsunami buoys and other flotsam.  “The largest were two large, floating fishing docks, both as long as tennis courts and half the width,” says Carlton. “The first dock arrived in Oregon in June 2012 and had 100 species on it.” That came from the Japanese port of Misawa, followed by another which reached Washington state in December that year. Two identical docks from Misawa remain missing.  “It’s the biggest rafting event ever aboard anthropogenic material, and the first time we’ve been able to track material on this scale,” says Carlton.  Arrivals are starting to tail off, but Carlton says the invasion is not over. “We’re waiting for the spring 2018 pulse to see what comes in.” What we know of is probably a fraction of what actually arrived, as much debris was cleared without analysis before the census began.  The sheer number of species surviving arduous trans-Pacific journeys is impressive. But the census also shows how potentially invasive species can travel further and for longer than before, because human-made materials – like fibreglass, used in many fishing boats – last longer than natural ones like wood or rafts formed from landslide material . Hatfield Marine Science Center Oregon State University  If climate change increases the number or strength of storms and typhoons that lash built-up coastlines, ever more species will be swept around the world, Carlton says. The current spate of hurricanes probably carried more debris out to sea, he adds.  “What’s of most concern is that growth in coastal infrastructure, ongoing plastic pollution , rising sea levels and extreme events make situations like the one documented more likely,” says Steven Chown of Monash University in Australia.  None of the Japanese species has yet become established or invasive in the US. “But after they arrive, it can take several years before we can detect them, so until they grow to a detectable point, we don’t know how many will settle,” says Carlton. “It’s like ecological roulette.” Journal reference: Science , DOI: 10.1126/science.aao1498  More on these topics:",,,english,,,persons,hatfield marine,negative,null,2017-09-28T22:19:50.001+03:00,,,,

Coe, J. Anderson, and R. van der Marel (STScI) By Leah Crane  Black holes take a long time to grow, so we do not expect to see many huge ones at great distances corresponding to the early universe, from which light is only now reaching us. The smaller black hole “seeds” that grow into these colossal black holes have to reach masses of 10 billion times that of the sun within a billion years after the big bang.  But astronomers keep finding more supermassive black holes there, making it unlikely that they all grew the same way most modern black holes do, by slowly devouring dust and gas.  Shingo Hirano at the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues used a simulation of conditions in the early universe to figure out how the progenitors of supermassive black holes are born. Advertisement  Hirano’s black hole seeds started out in a halo of dark matter blasted with supersonic streams of gas left over from the chaos of the big bang. The dark matter’s gravity captured some of the streaming gas, building up a dense cloud.  Normally, a dense cloud of gas would fragment apart and turn into many smaller stars, but the researchers found that the turbulence introduced by the streaming motion prevented the cloud from fragmenting or collapsing for a while. Rapid gas  Eventually, though, the gas cloud did get big enough to collapse in on itself , rapidly building a star thousands of times more massive than the sun. That star became a black hole 2 billion times the mass of the sun less than 800 million years after the Big Bang – much faster than the slow formation of modern black holes.  “Their massive seed black holes form extremely early on — much earlier than discussed in most other works,” says Zoltan Haiman at Columbia University in New York.  The earlier these seeds form, the harder it will be to observe them directly, since we can only see the early universe by looking extraordinarily far away. The only way to definitively test theories of supermassive black holes in the early universe is to use enormous telescopes to look for them – luckily, the next generation of space telescopes may be able to see deep enough into the distant universe to find black hole seeds.  “The formation of seed black holes is one of the most important outstanding questions in supermassive black hole research,” says Jenny Greene at Princeton University in New Jersey. “It will be very exciting to directly test models like this one with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.”  More on these topics:",,,english,,,persons,d. coe,negative,null,2017-09-28T22:19:51.006+03:00,,,,

Use of antibiotics in farming promotes the evolution of this resistance, but it has been unclear how countries should cut back on their use. Now epidemiologists have come up with an achievable plan that might cut antibiotic use on farms by 80 per cent.  Bacteria evolve resistance when they encounter antibiotics or acquire resistance genes from other bacteria. Some infections are now becoming incurable, but we are developing few new drugs to fight them, prompting the World Health Organization this month to describe the situation as a “ global health emergency ”.  There is compelling evidence that antibiotics given to livestock lead to antibiotic-resistant infections in people, says Lance Price of George Washington University, in Washington DC. The world is starting to take notice, and major players including China and KFC are planning to stop producing or using meat raised with “medically important” antibiotics. Advertisement Tipping point  These antibiotics are often used to promote growth in farmed animals. Around 130,000 tonnes of antibiotics are given to food animals annually, according to an analysis of global sales data published today. China alone accounts for 78,000 of these.  This means the use of antibiotics in animals now outstrips that in humans, as was predicted to happen this year . The team behind the analysis, which includes Thomas Van Boekel of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ETH Zrich, says this means that new resistance mutations are now more likely to arise in other animals than in humans, and calculate that if we continue on the current trajectory, by 2030 we may be giving 200,000 tonnes of antibiotics to animals every year.  But we can stop that happening. Boekel’s team has calculated that if rich countries and China capped their use of antibiotics to the current global average – that’s 50 milligrams per kilogram of milk, meat and eggs produced per year – then the use of drugs on farms in 2030 will be 60 per cent lower than predicted.  They argue that this is realistic, and could be done without much of a reduction in production. After the EU banned the use of antibiotic growth promoters in 2006, countries such as Denmark managed to maintain their production levels while using half this amount of antibiotics.  Eating less animal products would also help. If everyone ate only 165 grams of animal protein a day by 2030 – which is the expected EU average – the team calculates that antibiotic consumption by livestock would be 22 per cent lower than current predictions indicate. Urgent tax  As a final step, the team calculated that slapping a tax on veterinary antibiotics of half the price of the drug would cut global consumption by nearly a third – as well as generating billions of dollars in revenue that could be used to develop new drugs and help farmers in poorer countries adopt hygienic practices that make antibiotics unnecessary.  “This is not only doable, but urgently needed,” says Ramanan Laxminarayan of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in Washington DC, who worked on the study. He says such a tax could be exacted quickly.  Each of the plan’s three measures affect each other, but enacting all three in sequence would cut antibiotic use on farms by 80 per cent, the team predict.  The effect this will have on resistant infections in people is more difficult to predict, because such infections arise both in farm animals and in people. But a modelling study published earlier this year found that if antibiotics on farms are not limited, simply limiting the use of drugs in people will do little to cut resistance.  It’s been a year since the UN called for a global fight against antibiotic resistance , says Laxminarayan. “But there has been little movement on antibiotic use in the animal sector. Unless we act urgently, the window is closing on continued antibiotic effectiveness.”  Journal reference: Science , DOI: 10.1126/science.aao1495 ",,,english,,,persons,boekel,none,null,2017-09-28T22:19:52.002+03:00,,,,

At the International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide today, Musk announced SpaceX’s plans for an enormous new rocket that he says will go to Mars in 2022 and maybe eventually provide speedy trips around Earth.  The rocket, which Musk calls the BFR — the first and last letters stand for “big” and “rocket” – is smaller than the one he announced at the same event last year, carrying 150 tonnes compared to the previous design’s 300. It’s still more powerful than any of SpaceX’s or NASA’s other planned rockets.  Musk said that he plans to replace all of SpaceX’s other space vehicles – the Falcon 9 and Falcon 9 Heavy rockets and the Dragon capsule – with this new system. Advertisement  “All of our resources will then turn to the BFR, and we believe that we can do this with the revenue we see from launching satellites and from servicing the space station,” he said.  Once the BFR is up and running, he said, its first tasks will be satellite launches and bringing cargo and crew to the ISS. Fly me to the moon  Then, Musk said, it will make its way to the moon . “This will enable the creation of a lunar base. It’s 2017 – we should have a lunar base by now,” Musk said. “And then of course Mars, becoming a multi-planet species. Beats the hell out of being a single-planet species.”  The top stage of the rocket will be big enough for 40 cabins, each of which could hold up to 5 or 6 people, along with a solar storm shelter and entertainment area. Musk said that after the initial 2022 mission to Mars, he plans to send 4 BFRs to Mars in 2024, two of which are set to be crewed. Musk’s plan is to have them mine water and extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make fuel for return missions.  As for landing on Mars, one of the trickiest problems in spaceflight , Musk says that the spacecraft will use a propulsive landing method similar to the one that Falcon 9 rockets use. But unlike the Falcon 9, it won’t have legs, instead landing back on its launch mounts.  Finally, once SpaceX has sent a BFR to Mars, Musk said that the rockets might be used to travel between cities on Earth, shuttling passengers from New York City to Shanghai in 39 minutes.  “In about 6 to 9 months we should start building the first ship,” Musk said. “I feel fairly confident that we should be able to complete the ship and have our first launch in about 5 years. 5 years seems like a long time to me.”  However, Musk has a reputation for setting deadlines that he cannot meet.

One day, a 3D Sphere visits Flatland and whisks away a Square to a higher dimensional world. Square learns that Flatlanders are mere 2D projections of 3D beings. He then has the audacity to suggest that Sphere may be a shadow too – of a shape in four dimensions. “The very idea of it is utterly inconceivable,” says the appalled Sphere.  Henry Markram thinks we might be suffering from a similarly blinkered perspective when considering the workings of our own brains. “We look at the brain, we see its immense complexity, but if it’s a shadow projection from a higher dimension, we’ll never understand it,” Markram says. Those aren’t idle words: he and his colleagues of the Blue Brain Project at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) have been using algebraic topology, a field of mathematics used to characterise higher-dimensional shapes, to explore the workings of the brain.  What they have found beggars belief. As our brains think, learn and remember, they create elaborate but ephemeral structures in at least seven mathematical dimensions, and possibly many more. What’s more, these transient structures, which appear and disappear like sandcastles on a beach, could help us understand how the brain creates our thoughts and feelings. They might even unravel the greatest mystery of them all: consciousness. “Algebraic topology is the mathematics to take neuroscience out of Flatland,” says Markram.

The island’s electrical grid was unable to resist the one-two punch of Hurricane Irma followed by Maria. 250-kilometre-per-hour winds and 76 centimetres of rain have left nearly 100 per cent of the island without power. Puerto Rico’s governor Ricardo Rosselló calls the situation a “humanitarian emergency”.  The lack of power makes it hard to refrigerate food and to run air conditioning – both essential in the hot Caribbean climate. What’s more, pumps that push water for drinking, bathing and flushing toilets aren’t working. On Wednesday, FEMA reported that 42 per cent of the population was without potable water and more than 10,000 people were occupying 161 shelters. Advertisement  Nobody knows how long it will take to get the grid back online. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) can’t restore power without assistance, because it filed for bankruptcy in July under a crippling $9 billion debt.  The American Public Power Association (APPA), of which PREPA is a member, says the damage must first be assessed before it can determine how long repairs will take.  “ We don’t know if this is going to be a six-month situation, a five-month situation ,” says Mike Hyland, APPA’s senior vice president of engineering. “We don’t know if it’s going to be rolling crews in. We don’t know how many linemen from the Army Corps of Engineers will be available.” Problem after problem  Power was swiftly restored on the mainland US, but the situation in Puerto Rico is far worse, says Alexis Kwasinski at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Manpower is a factor. Places affected by Irma and Harvey benefited from “ mutual assistance agreements ”, which send electric crews from other states to help with repairs.  The severity of the damage is a bigger issue. Power grids are made up of three parts: generation, transmission and distribution. Typically, hurricanes and similar disasters mostly damage the distribution system, says Kwasinski. That’s what happened in Texas and Florida. But in Puerto Rico all three components have been damaged, so the repair job is bigger.  “More importantly, those states didn’t completely lose power like Puerto Rico did,” says Kwasinksi. “When the whole grid goes down, and you have to begin again from nothing, it’s much more complicated.”  This tricky process is called a black start . The challenge is that big power stations need a supply of electricity to start up, which has to come from smaller generators.  Kwasinski compares the generators that supply a power grid to a group of people holding up a big block of concrete. Once the block is up, each additional person makes it more stable, and with care it is possible to keep it up. But if everyone puts the block down, it takes painstaking work to lift it back up again. Is anyone watching?  Meanwhile the 3.4 million people of Puerto Rico must do without. Nearly all are without cell service and internet, because 1,360 of 1,600 cell towers were taken out by the storm. Most of the island’s infrastructure in is shambles, road closures make it difficult for emergency responders to reach citizens, and airport closures and plane delays have trapped thousands on the island.  President Trump declared a state of disaster on 21 September, yet media attention remained minimal .  One reason Puerto Rico hasn’t garnered as much attention as the aftermath of Harvey and Irma is that many Americans don’t realise Puerto Ricans are US citizens, says Brendan Nyhan at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. He and his colleague Kyle Dropp recently published poll results showing that people who did know Puerto Ricans are US citizens were more likely to support federal aid.  “As millions of Americans are without electricity and access to potable water, it’s certainly plausible that public pressure will mount,” says Nyhan. “More US citizens live in Puerto Rico than some US states, and we’d never accept, say, the state of Utah being without power.” Advertisement ",,,english,,,persons,kwasinski,none,null,2017-09-29T18:02:49.004+03:00,,,,

We stroke, cuddle, cultivate and eat all manner of creatures. The Animals Among Us offers a fascinating if flawed account of our entangled relationship with non-human animals Is stroking fur part of the reason we love to keep pets? Rip Hopkins/Agence VU/Camera Press By Pat Shipman  THE interaction between human and non-human animals fascinates everyone from anthropologists to the average pet owner. It even has a name – anthrozoology – as biologist John Bradshaw reminds us in the subtitle of his new book, The Animals Among Us .  As Bradshaw points out, for humans to consistently live with and nurture animals is a most unusual trait in nature. So a strong, fact-based discussion of how and why we do this and its effects should be eye-opening, engaging and thought-provoking.  Animals ticks some of those boxes, but by no means all. Bradshaw knows how to produce a well-written and accessible tome. A veteran of popular books about the lives and habits of cats and dogs, he focuses most on the ubiquity of people keeping animals, today and over the past few hundred years, and specifically on pets.  As he rightly observes, the practice of taking in and raising young animals is widespread among humans, little influenced by geography or culture. Oddly, though, he seems shocked that this intimacy can extend to the breast-feeding of young animals, domestic or wild. This isn’t rare in many modern cultures and probably wasn’t in the past. Calling groups who engage in the behaviour “surviving Palaeolithic peoples”, as he does, is inaccurate and culturally insensitive.  Bradshaw suggests that the inclusion of animals as intimate members of the family probably explains the long-term connection behind the genetic and behavioural alterations we now see in domestic species.  Even so, domestication is a less common outcome of keeping animals than we might expect, given that even the most generous list would only include 20 or so domesticated species. Many more have spent at least some time in captivity, so it is well worth asking why so many species that have lived intimately with us haven’t been domesticated. “It’s worth asking why so many species that have lived with us have never been domesticated”  For Bradshaw, the answer lies partly in the kinds of societies that kept animals. He reasons that in egalitarian, hunter-gatherer societies, animals could be brought into the family and kept temporarily before being eaten or sacrificed, or perhaps kept more permanently. As these societies gave way to stratified, agricultural societies, the animals that were kept depended on their benefit to the household at that time.  During this period, keeping domesticated animals became a status symbol – leading to the rise of pets. Part of their appeal, says Bradshaw (on little evidence), is an atavistic liking of stroking and grooming the fur of another, which he believes played a role in our ancestral, furry past (we lost most of it some 1.6 million years ago) as it does now among non-human primates.  But do we really keep pets so we can stroke them? Stroking a pet has been shown to raise circulating levels of the “feel-good” hormone oxytocin in both participants. Why don’t we keep pets that stroke us back?  Bradshaw’s main interest seems to lie in the period between medieval times and the 20th century, which makes this part of the book especially lively and informative. The Victorian era saw the rise of keeping pets and the display of animals with particular colours or shapes to confer status. This was also the time that breed societies and animal shows were founded, and there was a general growth of desirable “types” among all kinds of domestic species, particularly in the UK.  Bradshaw discusses this period at length, dwelling on the transformation of pets from working animals to “members of the family” as the attributes of domesticated species became a reflection of social standing. And in agricultural Britain, having good livestock or animals was of tremendous importance to their owners’ success. Cute or crazy? Constantine Manos/Magnum Photos  Modern life generally is now very different, more industrialised and urban, but the animals we live with continue to carry great social and symbolic weight. According to Bradshaw, Westerners have reached the third phase of living with animals, where the practice is so common that it is universally accepted.  In fact, pets are increasingly seen as offering us tangible benefits – as therapy animals, assistants to people who are blind or disabled, and companions to those who are socially isolated. Pets are often said to provide distinct health benefits to those with mental, social or physical problems, though Bradshaw points out that the evidence isn’t as strong as the claims for it.  In one of the best and most thought-provoking parts of his book, Bradshaw dissects the practice of anthropomorphism as a typically human attempt to understand the animals with which we live so intimately. He raises important questions about the greater significance of keeping pets and their benefits. For example, is assigning human characteristics to another species really key to the close emotional and family-type relationships many humans form with their pets? Does anthropomorphism balance out the energetic and economic costs of pets in the modern world?  I take a very different view: anthropomorphism is as much a barrier to domestication and close relationships with animals as it is a boon. My view of domestication is that humans and the species that find it worthwhile negotiate a common language – a world view that is neither human nor animal.  Even very clever dogs can’t understand more than a few hundred words, and they don’t share our framework for perception. Simply put, we perceive very little of what a dog does: for example, we are nearly scent-blind. Equally, dogs don’t perceive as we do nor think about things the way we do. For true cooperation and communication, dogs and humans must each alter their “language” so they understand each other. This process is active, a choice as well as an evolutionary adaptation. Casting a dog’s actions in human terms is tempting for a human, but doesn’t further the exchange of ideas by much.  At the end of the book, Bradshaw brings it all together by proposing four explanations of the human propensity for keeping pets. First, he reminds us of the idea that the loss of most of our body hair left us with a liking for stroking and grooming.  His second concerns the evolution of the human brain in a way that resulted in us being able to analyse animal behaviour and develop the capacity for anthropomorphism, leading to better animal-keeping.  His third explanation is that young women who were good at caring for animals may have been assumed to become better mothers, making them preferred as brides. This could cause a spread of genes that would make many people good with animals. “Does anthropomorphism balance out the energetic and economic costs of pets in the modern world?”  And last, he hypothesises that the rise of taboos against eating and killing personal (owned) animals enabled long-term pet-keeping, which is necessary for domestication. I am sceptical about this scenario since, again, little hard evidence supports it or links each stage to the next.  I wish Bradshaw had included more evidence on the much-researched origin of dogs. Surely the first instance of domestication in the world, of wolves into dogs, should play a crucial role in our understanding of the phenomenon of living with and domesticating animals?  But Bradshaw doesn’t dwell on the ongoing and exciting work investigating the genetic, morphological and behavioural differences among wolves and some dogs, including ancient fossil specimens. He neglects research on basal or genetically ancestral breeds, such as basenjis, dingoes and the recently rediscovered New Guinea mountain dogs. These species should tell us a lot about the sort of canid that was originally domesticated.  Bradshaw also gives short shrift to work by leading scholars, such as Mietje Germonpré at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and Melinda Zeder at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. And he often supports his arguments with out-of-date contributions to the field or articles in popular magazines or newspapers rather than peer-reviewed journals.  This means that he gives too much credence to ideas that haven’t been rigorously tested or that have been overturned by later studies. While there are many good things in his book, understanding and interpreting our tendency to live with animals and its impact is an important and vibrant field that deserves a fuller presentation than Bradshaw offers here.",,,english,,,persons,mietje germonpré,none,null,2017-09-30T13:21:39.000+03:00,,,,

The nation’s latest such endeavour is encapsulated in the supersonic Bloodhound SSC, but it is about far more than building a fast car. It also aims to engage and inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers by showcasing STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines in a variety of exciting ways.  In late October, Bloodhound SSC will start runway testing in Newquay, UK, at speeds of up to 300 kilometres per hour. This will provide valuable data and experience before the team heads for South Africa to chase a new world record speed of more than 1600 kilometres per hour. Importantly, it will also provide a real-life science showcase for the 250,000 young people who participate in Bloodhound-related workshops each year.  These activities, run by the charity Bloodhound Education, form one of the biggest STEM programmes in the UK, and one that engages students from primary school age to PhD level. Our various workshops combine hands-on activity with classroom instruction, along with a competitive element to involve and enthuse even the most laconic student.  The next stage of the programme will involve providing real data from the car, so students can participate in the decision-making as the engineers continue to develop the vehicle. Advertisement  During the past year, Bloodhound has involved more than 125,000 students in its workshops in both primary and secondary schools. You can help us inspire more students, either by sponsoring the project or by joining our team of volunteers who run the workshops and support other activities.

He was a largely self-educated, technically savvy polymath, a great communicator and writer of successful pulp science fiction. From the start, his vision was of a fully fledged space age, but after fleeing Nazi Germany for the US, he drifted at the fringes of real technical work.  He was also a visionary, garnering popular support through aspirational narratives that bridged the chasm between the cold equations of space flight and its romantic possibilities. Over time, Ley has been eclipsed by better-known actors such as Wernher von Braun (whom he knew well) and Isaac Asimov. Now a fascinating new biography by Jared Buss restores him as a central figure in the history of rocketry and its popularisation.  Ley’s role was complex, and his life took an intriguing and meandering path through many of the 20th century’s key events: the rise of airborne technology after the first world war; rocketry’s beginnings; the Nazis’ ascent; the cold war; the popularisation of the idea of space travel; and, finally, as apotheosis, the first moon landing, which occurred mere weeks after his death.  Ley’s prodigious output reflected the two sides of his character. As a public speaker and a writer for magazines such as Popular Mechanics and Amazing Stories , he romanticised the natural world, and gloried in the idea of brave explorers setting off into an unknown that awed and fascinated him. At the same time, his expertise and attachment to hard facts when discussing, for example, the technical details of weapons, revealed a man with hard-nosed engineering instincts.  Those instincts were hampered by a lack of technical education – he studied astronomy, zoology, physics and palaeontology at the University of Berlin. His wide-ranging curiosity never found its academic niche, and his ideas on the history of science remained those of autodidact and outsider.  Buffeted by the currents of contemporary politics, he was often frustrated by his failed attempts to kick-start or be involved in research on rocket engines. But Ley was always driven by a greater vision, which went beyond the bid for outer space. There is a wistfulness about his strenuously argued belief that education and critical reasoning are the source of democracy and progress. The reality was more complex, as Sputnik showed. “Ley was always driven by a greater vision, which went beyond the bid for outer space”  While close to the main actors, but excluded from contributing technically to the development of rockets, Ley settled on the role of proselytiser, fearlessly (or maybe shamelessly) preaching from all possible pulpits: television, radio and print media, but also via toy companies and Walt Disney, as a consultant for “Tomorrowland” in Disneyland in the 1950s.  He remained a public figure to the last, though his views became visibly dated as the heroic space narratives of the 1940s and 1950s, powered by an unbounded belief in technology, were replaced by more measured and critical views.  Buss’s book has weaknesses, particularly in its earlier chapters. Short repeated sentences, clichéd expressions and overly detailed recountings of the plots of several of Ley’s stories add to a sense of meandering. Some incorrectly spelled German text also suggests a lack of basic editorial checks.  More surprisingly for the work of a historian, the book, at least to start with, spins its tale from a thin set of sources, relying often on speculation rather than facts. Buss is happy to distance himself from Ley’s world view and his reminiscences of the intellectual climate and rise of pseudoscience in Nazi Germany, but he doesn’t offer the reader enough historical context to understand how those views might have taken hold.  In an odd way, Ley saves the book from beyond the grave, as it were. His indefatigable vision of space flight as part of humanity’s next step into the cosmos, his optimism about the future and conviction that science is the key to bettering humankind are compelling values. Caught up in Ley’s enthusiasm, the reader is almost tempted to consider them timeless.",,,english,,,persons,willy ley,negative,null,2017-10-01T13:15:25.005+03:00,,,,

Everyday objects could soon be used to control your television thanks to a technique that uses a webcam to recognise movements.  The system, called Matchpoint, allows you to select different objects, or body parts, to control aspects of the television. To set it up, the TV screen first displays icons representing functions, such as volume or changing channels. Once one has been selected, a chosen object is used to draw a circle in the air when prompted, transforming it into a remote control. A cup, for example, could then be used to adjust the volume by moving it laterally to coincide with a slider control onscreen. It retains its role as long as the camera can see it moving.  Similar systems typically identify objects or people. However, a change of position can affect recognition and cause them to fail. In one of its moddes, Matchpoint simply looks for movement, different people can operate the controls and the object doesn’t even need to be in full view. Advertisement  False activation can be an issue with gesture control, if a person accidentally makes the commanding signal. Christopher Clarke at Lancaster University, UK, who developed Matchpoint with his colleagues, designed it with this in mind, choosing a circular motion to link an object with a control that is hard to make unintentionally. In addition, the controls aren’t active while watching a show when they are hidden from view. Surgical use  It’s well-suited for multi-tasking, too. It would be handy when your hands are occupied with something else, says Chris Harrison at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who researches new ways of interacting with computers. “While making dinner in the kitchen, this could be very useful.”  Medical professionals have expressed an interest for the same reason. Surgeons sometimes have to access information on a screen during surgery, for example. “They wouldn’t have to put the tools down and touch anything, which would be unhygienic,” says Clarke.  Focusing on movement makes the system accessible to a wider range of people. Whereas hand gestures are restrictive for people with certain disabilities, Matchpoint can be easily tailored to individual needs.  In everyday situations though, using objects as controls could be just a novelty. “A remote control or more rudimentary hand gestures might be more practical,” says Harrison. Since the system relies on a webcam, it struggles when lighting is poor. And if a chosen object is too small, it would be hard for the system to track it.  Still, Clarke and his team plan to add additional functions. A simple gesture could be used to wake up the system while watching a programme, for example. The concept will be demonstrated at the UIST2017 conference in Quebec City in Canada next month. Advertisement",,,english,,,persons,clarke,none,null,2017-10-02T02:17:41.001+03:00,,,,

That means we have time to prepare Are there social consequences to extending life? Niall McDiarmid/Millennium Images, UK  ON 17 October 1995, a French woman called Jeanne Calment set a new official record for human longevity: 120 years and 238 days. When she died, she was 122 years, 164 days. Her record still stands.  You might conclude from this that research aimed at extending the human lifespan has gone nowhere, and that 120 or so remains a non-negotiable upper limit. If the radical claims of life extension science are true, where are all the supercentenarians?  The answer is: they are still in middle age. Today’s oldest person, a Japanese woman called Nabi Tajima, turned 97 the day Calment died – already too old to benefit from treatments aimed at slowing or reversing ageing. We won’t start to see any population-level effects of targeted life extension for another 30 to 40 years, when today’s septuagenarians may be entering their 12th decade in increasing numbers. Advertisement  Whether this will happen is still an open question. Nothing has yet been shown to work in humans, although there are promising avenues , including research on the rejuvenating effects of young blood (see “ Exclusive: Inside the clinic offering young blood to cure ageing “). Most may prove to be dead ends, but the quantity of research effort and money that has been poured into anti-ageing suggests that if it is possible, it is going to happen.  That is good news for individuals, but a challenge for society. Consider that Tajima was born in the 19th century and reached retirement age more than 57 years ago. Now extrapolate that life trajectory to large numbers of people. Bioethicists have long flagged concerns about the social consequences of life extension, including overpopulation and the prospect of a “care home world” full of decrepit people. These problems are half a lifetime away, and are unlikely to be a deal-breaker. But it is not too soon to start thinking seriously about how we should deal with them.

T. Anderson and Dave Hutchinson Henrik Sorensen/Getty By Abigail Nussbaum  In the near-future China of Maggie Shen King’s An Excess Male (Harper Voyager), the country’s one-child policy has resulted in a shortage of eligible women, and a vast, unmarriageable male population. Viewing this as a potential source of civil unrest, the government vastly restricts people’s rights and freedoms, and encourages them to enter into polyandrous marriages. Forty-something Wei-guo has finally saved enough money to enter into negotiations to become the third husband of May-ling, already married to brothers Hann and Xiong-xin. The novel switches between their four points of view in order to explore the stresses of such an arrangement, as well as the social forces that can make it advantageous and even desirable.  One can sense the influence of Margaret Attwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale in King’s construction of her future society, particularly her use of neologisms and the repressive social policies they stand for, designed to “solve” the problem of the excess male population. Gay men are dubbed Willfully Sterile, forced to either register or be hospitalised. Men who have difficulty socialising or have autism are designated Lost Boys and can be institutionalised and sterilised. Single men like Wei-guo are assigned Helpmates for impersonal “hygiene sessions” in which the authorities prescribe the precise extent of sexual contact.  Despite these policies and the unhappiness they cause, An Excess Male is less a dystopia than it is a novel of manners, in which each of the characters must navigate norms both old and new in order to arrive at that holy grail of so much fiction: a good marriage. King and her characters are open about the flaws of the novel’s social structures; the later chapters focus on a terrible act of abuse, which the characters struggle to expose. But An Excess Male also suggests that the exigencies of its premise have opened the door to new definitions, not just of marriage, but of masculinity.  Far from devolving into brutality and violence, as their government fears, the societies that arise in the novel give men the opportunity to be nurturing and supportive. Polyandrous marriages, similarly, offer the male characters companionship not just with their wives, but with each other, as exemplified by Wei-guo’s fathers who, though straight, remain married even after his mother’s death. While King can hardly be said to be advocating the society she describes, which victimises and entraps both men and women, An Excess Male does end with the creation of a new family: one that requires all four spouses to function.  A different combination of dystopia and romance can be found in M. T. Anderson’s Landscape With Invisible Hand (Candlewick Press).  When Earth is discovered by the alien vuvv, they initially claim to have come in peace, offering technological breakthroughs in exchange for resources. The reality, however, is the type of colonisation and exploitation familiar from Earth’s own history. As the economy collapses, a tiny sliver of the population live like kings, serving the vuvv, while the remainder are left jobless and scrambling for survival.  Since the vuvv exoticise and fetishise human behavior, teenager Adam and his girlfriend Chloe decide to broadcast their relationship to an admiring alien audience, selling a vision of romance carefully tailored to appeal to the vuvv’s simplistic understanding of human customs.  Adam also hopes to win an art contest organised by the vuvv. The vuvv, however, are put off by his choosing to depict the ravages caused by their arrival. After all, they explain, they can see vuvv installations anywhere, and they much prefer the “wild” Earth depicted in Adam’s more fantastical paintings.  The resulting story feels like a cross between The Hunger Games and the Black Mirror episode “Fifteen Million Merits”, pondering the cost of selling yourself to an audience that does not recognise your humanity. Adam and Chloe’s relationship crumbles under the strain of having to model what the vuvv take human love to be, and Adam is inevitably forced to choose between artistic integrity and his family’s future. The speed with which the characters go from middle-class security and self-confidence to bare subsistence might strike adult readers as a little overdetermined. But the combination of non-standard sci-fi ingredients, such as the focus on art and reality TV, and an extremely dark sense of humour, give Landscape With Invisible Hand a flavour all its own, one that will appeal to readers of any age.  Leaving Earth for the far reaches of outer space, Dave Hutchinson’s novella Acadie (Tor.com) focuses on Duke Faraday, the reluctant president of an anarchic space colony that has for centuries been relentlessly pursued by Earth’s Bureau of Colonisation. His job, run on the principle that only people with no interest in politics should be entrusted with public office, is usually a light one. But when a BoC probe appears in the colony’s system, he must corral a population of independent-minded geniuses and misfits to arrange an evacuation that will leave Earth clueless as to their new whereabouts.  Readers familiar with the political slant of Hutchinson’s Fractured Europe sequence will be puzzled to find him writing about a Robert Heinlein-esque libertarian utopia, and perhaps fatigued by the dozens of paragraphs of explaining the colony’s workings. Not surprisingly, then, the story ends with a twist, but this, alas, is delivered so abruptly as to leave one feeling even more wrong-footed. Lost in space, as it were.

Now tags you can't copy could block bogus goods forever Mihai Andritoiu/Getty By Ida Emilie Steinmark  DETECTIVES from the City of London Police had been investigating the activities of Robert Czernik for a year. In February, they finally picked him up and charged him with “selling goods liable to be mistaken for a registered trademark”. That might not sound like a heinous offence, but the goods in question were counterfeit car airbags that would not have worked properly in a collision. Police have alerted 680 people they think bought the airbags on eBay, and Czernik is due to be tried in the coming weeks.  It’s a reminder that all manner of goods are subject to fakery. People have tried to counter the problem for hundreds of years using devices intended to prove authenticity. In the Middle Ages, elaborate wax seals were the method of choice in Europe. Today, holograms and watermarks are ubiquitous. But the principle has remained the same all along: tag goods with an object that is extremely difficult to copy. Trouble is, “extremely difficult” isn’t always good enough – we need tags that are impossible to copy.  That is not beyond our wits. The basic recipe for unfakable tags has been around for 15 years, but it was always too complicated, costly and impractical. But make it work – as one man now claims he has – and fakery could be a thing of the past.  Criminals do a roaring trade in forging consumer products from cigarettes and alcohol to condoms. They aren’t shy of opportunism: knock-off solar observing glasses led to permanent eye damage for one man watching August’s US eclipse .

Copyright: Nobel Media AB 2017 By Douglas Heaven  The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded jointly to Jeffrey C Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W Young for their work on the mechanisms controlling circadian rhythms – the internal clocks that living organisms use to track the day-night cycle.  All life on Earth has evolved on a planet that spins on its axis once every 24 hours. As different parts of its surface face the sun, conditions can change dramatically. Days bring warmth and light, nights are cool and dark. A biological clock in the cells of plants, animals and humans anticipates these fluctuations to optimise behaviour and physiology.  The existence of an inner clock has been known about since 1729 when French scientist Jean-Jaques d’Ortous de Mairan found that the daily movement of a plant’s leaves to track the sun continued when it was kept in the dark. There must be something inside plants controlling the daily progression. But what that was remained a mystery for a long time. Advertisement  Our biological clock helps to regulate sleep patterns, feeding behavior, hormone release and blood pressure #NobelPrize pic.twitter.com/NgL7761AFE  — The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 2, 2017  To find out, this year’s Nobel laureates looked inside the cells of fruit flies to see how they ticked. In 1984 they studied a gene called period . Hall and Rosbach found that it acts like an hour glass, producing a protein that accumulates in the cell during the night and then degrades during the day.  They then found that this ebb and flow is controlled by the period protein itself, which inhibits the activity of the gene that makes it. As levels increase, production stops. The same gene was found to be at work in other organisms too, including humans. 24-hour cycle  For this mechanism to work, the period protein must get into the nucleus so that it can regulate the DNA that makes it, and this is where Young came in. He identified another clock gene called timeless . This gene produces a second protein that binds to the period protein and helps it enter a cell’s nucleus.  Young later also found a gene called doubletime , which finetunes the timing of this clock so that our cells work in a 24-hour cycle.  Since circadian rhythms seem to control so many of our biological processes, these discoveries have profound implications for our understanding of disease and all-round well-being, says the Nobel committee. Chronic mismatches in circadian rhythm have been linked to many conditions, from cancer to depression , and researchers are now using light to reset body clocks to treat a number of brain disorders .  The announcements for this year’s awards continue with physics on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.

Promising results from animal studies targeting the liver, muscles and the brain suggest that the CRISPR genome-editing method could revolutionise medicine, allowing us to treat or even cure a huge range of disorders.  The CRISPR genome-editing method was only developed in 2012, but it is proving so powerful and effective that around 20 trials in humans have already begun or will soon . Almost all of these involve removing cells from an individual’s body, editing their DNA and then putting them back into the body.  This approach has immense promise, for instance, it is being used to alter immune cells to make them better at killing cancers . It’s relatively easy to remove immune cells or blood stem cells, edit them, and then return them to the body, but this isn’t possible with most bodily tissues. Advertisement  So editing cells inside the body would allow us to treat far more conditions – from genetic disorders to high cholesterol – and would also be cheaper than growing and editing cells outside the body. What diseases could be treated this way? “Absolutely everything,” says Irina Conboy of the University of California, Berkeley. Liver disease  The big challenge is delivering the CRISPR machinery to tissues inside the body. Editing genes with CRISPR requires at least two components: a protein that cuts DNA and a piece of RNA that guides it to the precise DNA site to make the cut.  Proteins and RNAs are enormous molecules compared with conventional drugs. It’s hard to get them inside cells, and they don’t usually survive in the bloodstream, either.  But biologists have been working on delivering big molecules to cells for decades and are now adapting various methods for genome editing. Intellia Therapeutics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, for instance, is using fatty particles to deliver the CRISPR components to livers.  One aim is to treat a rare genetic disease called transthyretin amyloidosis, caused by excessive production of the TTR protein. Last week, the company reported that it managed to disable the TTR gene in the livers of mice, reducing levels of the protein by 97 per cent with no signs of any ill effects .  Intellia is also working on a cure for hepatitis B , which infects 250 million people worldwide. The virus can be difficult to eliminate because viral DNA can linger in liver cells. CRISPR can destroy this DNA .  The liver is the easiest organ to deliver fatty particles to because it filters the blood. Anything injected into the blood supply is likely to reach the organ. Conboy’s team has managed something more difficult: they have treated the muscle-wasting disease muscular dystrophy in mice by injecting gold nanoparticles carrying the CRISPR components directly into muscle. Muscular dystrophy  What’s more, Conboy’s team actually fixed the faulty gene rather than simply disabling it, as Intellia did. Repairing genes is much harder than disabling them. It only worked in 5 per cent of muscle cells, but that was enough to boost muscle strength. And Conboy thinks the proportion of repaired cells could be increased by repeated injections of the gold nanoparticles, although her group has not yet shown this.  “I think this delivery method is fantastic for certain applications,” says Jeffrey Chamberlain at the University of Washington. However, to treat disorders such as muscular dystrophy, muscles all around the body – including the heart – need to be edited. They cannot all be injected directly, so the group hopes to find a way to get the gold nanoparticles into tissues throughout the body.  Chamberlain has been able to edit tissues all over the body using viruses. Earlier this year, his team successfully treated muscular dystrophy in mice by injecting them with an adeno-associated virus carrying DNA coding for the CRISPR components. Avoiding errors  But there is a big safety issue with viral delivery. If the cutting protein is added to cells, as in the gold nanoparticle method, it soon breaks down. But the viral method involves inserting the DNA for the protein into cells instead, which means the cutting protein keeps being made for weeks after treatment. This greatly increases the chance of DNA also being cut in the wrong place, says Chamberlain.  Already, though, Nicole Deglon of Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland and colleagues have developed a way to prevent the cutting protein lingering for too long when viruses are used for delivery. Their “kamikaze” CRISPR system not only disables the target gene, it also disables the gene for the cutting protein after a short delay.  Last month, her team showed that this system reduces off-target effects in a mouse study targeting the gene that causes Huntington’s disease. What’s more, they managed to disable the gene in 65 per cent of cells in the key area of the animals’ brains. “I was amazed to see how efficient it was,” says Deglon.  Altogether, a range of methods for delivering CRISPR are showing promise, suggesting the technique’s potential for treating some of our most difficult diseases could soon be realised. It’s impossible to say how soon trials in humans will begin, says Deglon. But the field is advancing so rapidly that it may not be that long. “It’s going faster and faster,” she says.

The lowdown on counterfeits you meet day to day From cash to car parts, and drugs to drink, here’s how much of the stuff you buy and use is probably fake – and how to tell Stephen Barnes/Middle East / Alamy Stock Photo By Joshua Howgego  Have you ever bought a knock-off handbag, or been tempted to watch an illegal copy of a film? If you have, you’d be in good company. 90 per cent of adults find the idea of buying counterfeit goods morally wrong, according to a survey in the UK , but many of those asked did it anyway – 42 per cent admitted buying pirated films and music, for example (see chart, below). Advertisement  Even if you baulk at the idea of buying fake goods, it’s more than likely you’ve used them without even realising it. But there are some simple ways to know whether you’re buying the real deal, if you know what to look out for. Read more: Fighting fakery – How to make products immune to counterfeiting Alcohol  Fancy a cool glass of wine, or perhaps a gin and tonic? Make sure it isn’t fake alcohol, which can be lethal, especially spirits. The problem is that unless they are distilled with care, some methanol can get in. Methanol is much more toxic than ethanol; drink enough and you could go blind and die.  In spite of that, after films, music and clothes, alcohol was the most popular counterfeit item purchased by those UK survey respondents was. In 2014, HMRC, the UK customs authority, seized 2500 litres of fake wine and spirits in a single pre-Christmas crackdown .  So how can you tell fake alcohol from the real thing? The UK Food Standard Agency suggests thinking in terms of four Ps. Watch out when you’re buying the most routinely faked Products, like vodka. If the Price looks too good to be true, it probably is. Shoddy Packaging is another giveaway. And think about Place too; don’t trust booze that isn’t from a reputable establishment. Food  The UK was hit by a horse meat scandal in 2013, with horse being passed off as other meats and getting into food sold by the nation’s retailers. In July, three men were sentenced to a combined total of 114 months in jail for their part in the debacle.  Food fraud is a broad church; it can also mean labelling cheap cheese as bona fide Parmesan, or diluting premium olive oil with sunflower oil. That makes it hard to say how much of an issue it is, but we do know certain foods to be particularly problematic — manuka honey sales around the world, for example, are five times higher than the amount produced.  There’s probably not a lot individuals can do to detect food fraud, because processing does such a lot to disguise its origins. But the authorities can use DNA tests at random points in the production chains to keep track of what ingredients are really present . The US Food and Drug Administration has published a DNA database for about 250 commonly caught fish, which can be used to identify their presence.  Several supermarkets, including the US giant Walmart, are piloting public databases that show the provenance and processing of each of its food products. These databases use blockchain technology, which can’t be tampered with without leaving traces, so in principle can give consumers more confidence in where their food came from. Cash  It’s obvious why you’d want to forge a banknote, but how much of a problem are they? Our best indication is the number of fake banknotes removed from circulation each year, though the real number of fakes is probably higher. The Bank of England removed 347,000 banknotes in 2016, about 0.1 per cent of the number out there . The figure for US dollars is lower: about 0.005 per cent of the currency in circulation is fake. The US Secret Service seized $30 million worth at the end of last year.  In the UK, £20 notes seem to be the most commonly faked (see chart, below). Shops have been able to spot fake notes by drawing lines on notes with special pens that react to starch in paper, but these will be useless with the transition to new polymer notes . There are, however, other clues to look out for .  Coins can be even more of a problem. In the UK, about 2.6 per cent of £1 coins circulating in 2015 were fakes according to the Royal Mint. However, the new 12-sided £1 — “the most secure coin in the world” according to the Mint — should be much harder to forge. For example, it has an image on the front that changes from a £ symbol to the number 1 when viewed from different angles. Medicines  The problem of fake drugs is most acute in developing countries, where as much as 30 per cent of medicine may be fake , according to Interpol. Residents of wealthy countries are on much safer ground if getting supplies from a pharmacy. But don’t try buying drugs online. The WHO estimates that half the drugs sold online are fake . In the last major Interpol operation against the counterfeiters, in 2015, fake drugs worth $81 million were seized and 156 people arrested .  Researchers in Switzerland who studied a range of counterfeit pills recovered from operations like this found that many have similarities, including batch numbers and chemical composition, suggesting that a single sophisticated gang might be behind a large fraction of these fakes worldwide. Fake comments on social media  Fire up Facebook, navigate to a post by a news organisation and have a look at the comments. Chances are that at least one in 10 is from a fake user. Why? Well, it makes sense for organisations to want “likes” for their pages; it makes them look popular. To cash in on that desire, there are firms offering to sell people likes that it will deliver via bots. Those bots can be programmed to spout certain points of view, making it seem to the casual observer as though lots of real people hold them. It’s sometimes known as astroturfing , because it produces something that looks like grassroots activism, and it doesn’t just affect Facebook.  If you think you have spotted a fake account on Facebook, you can go to the profile, click on the ellipsis symbol in their cover photo and click “report” .

Explosive burps of methane flowing into young Mars’s atmosphere might have temporarily warmed the planet, allowing liquid water to persist even after Mars entered its dry period. Rovers and orbiters have found evidence that Mars had rivers 3 billion years ago, suggesting things occasionally warmed up enough for ice to melt and flow as water, sometimes for a million years.  The reason might have been giant bursts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, according to Edwin Kite of the University of Chicago. These methane deposits, which may date to the birth of Mars, could even be responsible for temporary methane burps spotted by modern Mars spacecraft.  The methane bursts would have happened as Mars wobbled on its axis. Like Earth, Mars is tilted on its axis, but that tilt can change wildly over time because of relationships between its orbit and that of Jupiter. When Mars was extremely tilted, its ice deposits spent more time in direct sunlight, so they could have melted. This would free methane trapped in the ice crystals. Advertisement  “It’s basically ice that you can set on fire. You can flick a lighter at it, and get a flame,” he says. “In your hand, it looks like ice, but at the pressures at Earth’s surface, it is unstable so it releases methane gas.” Explosive eruptions  During periods of extreme Martian tilt, the stored methane would explosively erupt into the atmosphere, warming it enough to melt frozen lakes and start rivers flowing. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun would eventually break down the methane, but it could persist for up to a million years, says Kite.  The timing and duration of extreme-tilt events matches the duration and relative rarity of lake-forming climates in Mars’s history, his team found. Adding a 1 per cent dose of methane to a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, at the same pressure as Earth’s atmosphere, would raise temperatures by 6°C – enough to melt Martian ice.  This would only be possible if Mars also had a blanket of CO 2 to keep it warm, too, Kite says. The methane would just be an added boost. But recent evidence suggests Mars may not have had as much CO 2 as researchers thought. Missing elements  Thomas Bristow of NASA’s Ames Research Center and his colleagues recently found a dearth of carbonate minerals in rocks Curiosity has been studying inside Gale Crater.  “Having a thick CO 2 -rich atmosphere leads to some expectations about the kinds of rocks you would find deposited at that time. You would expect to see lots of carbonate minerals around, particularly in sedimentary rocks,” Bristow says, “but we don’t see them.”  Does this mean there was indeed low CO 2 ? Or, that it was somehow sequestered from the lakebed Curiosity is now traversing and may be in rocks we haven’t studied yet? That’s an open question — but “if Tom’s right, I’m wrong”, Kite says. If there was no CO 2 , “there would be no net warming at all if you released methane into the atmosphere, because you need the CO 2 , too”.  The true test for methane may come from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter , a European mission that arrived at Mars last fall. It will begin measuring the Martian atmosphere next spring, Kite says. It may be able to detect faint signals of methane at present, lending heft to the idea that methane burps could have warmed ancient Mars.",,,english,,,persons,bristow,none,null,2017-10-02T19:23:25.005+03:00,,,,

Now it seems they might all have formed the same way, even though they are made of different materials.  Ceres is speckled with hundreds of bright splotches . An international team led by Ernesto Palomba at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome is analysing the light reflected by them – as observed by Dawn, presently in orbit around Ceres – to identify any differences between them.  “The bright spots are only bright relative to Ceres’ already-dark surface,” says Nathanial Stein , a collaborator at the California Institute of Technology. “If you saw those spots on Earth or even on [the asteroid] Vesta you would consider them to be dark spots.” Advertisement  While the biggest and brightest spots are in Occator crater, more exist elsewhere on the dwarf planet. “Almost all of them are associated with impact craters,” says Stein. The team found 90 per cent of the bright spots are in craters or are debris ejected from a crater.  Researchers theorise that the spots are the result of the heat of an impact melting subsurface materials, which then well up to the surface to create the bright spots.  “As of 20 years ago we would have said that Ceres was just a big, round rock that was the same the whole way through,” explains Andy Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. The jagged mountains and craters led researchers to theorise that Ceres might have an icy core with a rock-ice mantle.  But these spots are telling a story of a younger, more geologically active Ceres than researchers expected. That’s because we would expect material ejected by impacts to mix eventually and create a uniform surface. “Mixing hasn’t had time to occur yet, which means these spots must be young.” Changing its spots  Over time, the bright spots could be darkening as exposure to the harsh conditions of space scours their surface, or because darker material is being tossed around by subsequent impacts.  Most of the spots are made from the same basic material as the rest of Ceres’s surface: calcium or magnesium carbonates mixed with ammonia-rich clays. But a handful of the spots in the youngest craters – including the exceptionally bright spots in Occator crater – are made of sodium carbonates without nearly as much ammonium clay.  These are small variations, but they are enough to point to new avenues of enquiry.  “Does this mean that there are different formation mechanisms that account for the different compositions?” asks Stein, “or is it just that they’re end-members of the same process?” The compositions of the bright spots seem similar enough that they could be explained by the impact-melt and upwelling theory, just modified by local conditions on the surface.  “Carbonates are interesting because they’re made via reactions between water and minerals with carbon in them,” says Rivkin. While researchers don’t expect to find life on Ceres, understanding the processes that created carbonates in the bright spots will help them think about the types of reactions necessary for life to occur in such a hostile environment.  The next step is to build a computer model of Ceres based on everything scientists have learned about its composition, then start pelting it with simulated rocks to try to match the craters and bright spots we see there today. “We have all the information we need,” says Stein. Now researchers just need to figure out how to piece it together.  And after that? “These bright spots are almost certainly where you would want to send the next mission,” says Rivkin, dreaming of future exploration with robotic landers or rovers on Ceres.

Off Laguna, Brazil, fishers stand in a line in waist-deep water or wait in canoes while, farther out, bottlenose dolphins chase shoals of mullet to the shore. The fishers can’t see the fish in the murky water, so they wait for the dolphins to give a signal — like an abrupt dive or tail slap — then cast their nets. Advertisement Read more: Synchronised swimming seems to make dolphins more optimistic  Fishers catch larger and more fish when they work with dolphins. “Dolphins likely reap similar benefits,” says Mauricio Cantor of the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil – it might be easy for them to gobble up fish disoriented by the nets.  But only some dolphins, working alone or in small groups, cooperate with humans. To explore the differences between helpful and unhelpful dolphins, Cantor and his colleagues recorded the sounds made by both types while they foraged either on their own or with people. Whistle while you fish  Surprisingly, the whistles of cooperative dolphins were different from those of non-cooperative ones, even when foraging alone. For instance, they used fewer ascending whistles.  Dolphins from different regions often whistle differently, Cantor says, but “it is much less common to find such acoustic differences among dolphins of the same population that inhabit such a small area”.  Since cooperative dolphins also whistle differently when fishing solo, the researchers don’t think these calls carry specific messages about fishing with people. Instead, the whistles may be a way for dolphins to label themselves as members of a particular social group, Cantor says. Read more: Two dolphin species band together to form unprecedented alliance  Alternatively, the dolphins may be using dialect or slang. Cantor says it is “as if they speak the same language but use some ‘expressions’ that are exclusive to their social community”.  Dolphins also use clicks to communicate during feeding, says Elena Papale of the Italian National Research Council. Researchers will need to examine clicks as well as whistles to better understand the dolphins’ communication styles.

The implants included an artificial windpipe, a synthetic tear duct and an arterial graft.  The inquiry, led by Stephen Wigmore of the University of Edinburgh at the request of UCL, was triggered by the university’s relationship with Paolo Macchiarini , a surgeon at the centre of a scandal in which six of eight patients who received synthetic windpipes died. Advertisement  In 2016, Macchiarini, who held an honorary professorship at UCL, was fired from the Karolinska Institute for multiple violations.  The inquiry highlighted several cases of misconduct, including that involving a 36-year-old Eritrean man living in Iceland , who had a slow growing tumour in his trachea. Macchiarini made the clinical decision to remove the tumour and replace the affected segment of trachea with a synthetic graft. This graft was provided by Alexander Seifalian, who no longer works at UCL. Deep regret  The inquiry found that Seifalian’s laboratory was not licensed to make clinical grade devices and did not request permission to use the unlicensed devices. In a written testimony to the inquiry, Macchiarini indicated that he was not aware that the graft had not been made to clinical standard.  Seifalian welcomes the inquiry but stresses that his job was to do the basic research in the development of synthetic materials for biomedical applications. “The implantation was the job of the surgeon, who requires getting ethical approval and [regulatory] approval. This was not my job.”  “We see, time and time again, research scientists being made scapegoats for systemic problems,” he adds. “I am extremely proud of the excellent, innovative work we did at UCL and we continue to build on this to address global health challenges in a responsible and ethical manner.”  The inquiry discovered other documents that suggested plastic discs manufactured at the university but not approved for human use had been sent to Mumbai, India, where they had been implanted under the skin of a patient to test that the material was biocompatible.  An arterial graft and a synthetic tear duct also manufactured at UCL were used in operations despite not being made to accepted quality standards.  The inquiry made several recommendations to the University, including reviewing their honorary appointment process, working to improve oversight for products with clinical applications, and in assisting patients who interact with researchers.  In a statement, UCL said: “We deeply regret that materials that had not undergone rigorous preclinical assessment and which were not made to [approved] standards, were manufactured and supplied by Professor Alexander Seifalian’s research laboratory for direct clinical use. Our governance systems should have prevented that. We also regret the wider, negative impact that this work had on the field of regenerative medicine research.”  More on these topics:",,,english,,,,,,null,2017-10-02T21:30:30.008+03:00,,,,

DANI I. JESKE/De Agostini/Getty By Michael Marshall  Life may have begun on our planet hundreds of millions of years earlier than thought, according to two studies published this week. But both papers are already proving controversial.  Ben Pearce of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and colleagues simulated conditions on early Earth to find out how readily the key molecules of life could have formed. They focused on “warm little ponds” on land, which are one of the suspected sites of the origin of life – the other being deep-sea vents .  Pearce tackled the formation of RNA, a close cousin of DNA that is widely thought to have been the basis for the first life . Many of the building blocks of RNA are found in asteroids and meteoroids, so Pearce calculated how much could have been delivered to Earth by impacting rocks – of which there were plenty during Earth’s first billion years – and then how much could have accumulated in ponds, given the molecules’ fragility and tendency to leech away. Advertisement  He concluded that RNA could have formed within a handful of years of major impacts, implying that life could have formed very early in Earth’s history.  There are two problems with this argument, says John Sutherland of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.  One is that organic compounds carried in meteorites would not necessarily survive the impact . “Large impactors that would have delivered the most organic material, collide with such energy that their organic cargo is atomised,” says Sutherland. In line with this, a recent study found that meteorite impacts can create temperatures of more than 2300°C .  The other problem is that Pearce simulated the wrong chemical process, Sutherland says. Pearce assumed that the first step in making RNA is linking together smaller molecules called nucleobases and ribose, but this “was experimentally shown not to work ages ago”, says Sutherland. In 2009 Sutherland demonstrated an alternative way of making RNA from simpler building blocks ( Nature , doi.org/chvzcw ). “These authors are still assuming the old model,” he says.  A second study, published last Wednesday, claims to have identified the oldest firm evidence of life – dating back 3.95 billion years. That is only half a billion years after the Earth formed. Reliable fossils of microorganisms have been dated to roughly 3.5 billion years ago , but the evidence for older life has been less clear.  Tsuyoshi Komiya of the University of Tokyo, Japan, and colleagues studied graphite found in ancient rocks in northern Labrador, Canada. Graphite is a crystalline form of carbon used to make pencil leads. It contains two forms of carbon: carbon-12 and carbon-13. The samples Komiya looked at had relatively little carbon-13 ( Nature , doi.org/cdqn ).  This, the team claims, is evidence that life was present. And not just any life: organisms that were taking in carbon from their surroundings and using it as raw material to make new organic compounds. Such organisms are known as “autotrophs” and today they include all green plants, which manufacture sugar from carbon dioxide and water. These early autotrophs would have been single-celled organisms and they probably used a different chemical process, but the idea is the same. Autotrophs prefer to use carbon-12, so their remains tend to have very little carbon-13.  This result is surprising for several reasons. First, at this time, Earth was being bombarded by large rocks from space , which would have battered the young planet’s surface. If life was present, it must have been impressively resilient.  But only if Komiya’s study is correct. His only evidence for the existence of life is the unusual ratio of carbon isotopes, and this may not be definitive. “There are many ways in which abiotic processes can produce such an imbalance, so to conclude that it is evidence for life is simply not justified,” says Sutherland.  Sutherland says a set of chemical reactions known as the Fischer-Tropsch process could be responsible. This process makes organic compounds from hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and show a similar bias towards carbon-12. It is known to occur naturally, for instance in meteorites .  Komiya’s team assumed these reactions were not responsible for their results, on the grounds that there cannot have been hydrogen in Earth’s atmosphere. But Sutherland says there could well have been. If there was water and carbon monoxide in the air, and hot iron from meteorite impacts to act as a catalyst , “hydrogen can easily be generated”.  Nevertheless, evidence is mounting that life was present earlier than 3.5 billion years ago. For instance, in 2016 fossilised stromatolites – layered mounds made by microbes living in sediments – were controversially claimed to have been found in 3.7-billion-year-old rocks . Then in March 2017, researchers described apparent fossilised microbes from rocks that were 3.77 to 4.28 billion years old ( Nature , doi.org/f9s5gw ). That claim also divided opinion .

Elmehed. © Nobel Media 2017 By Andy Coghlan  Just two years after their discovery, gravitational waves have earned a Nobel prize for Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne, the three leaders of the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration that found the waves on 14 September 2015. The discovery, which was announced publicly in 2016 , confirmed predictions made 100 years ago by Albert Einstein.  Half of the $1.1 million prize went to Weiss, the remainder shared between Barish and Thorne. “It’s really wonderful, but I view this more as recognition of around 1000 people who contributed and a result of dedicated efforts over 40 years,” said Weiss, reacting to the announcement.  “The discovery, the first ever observation of gravity waves, is a milestone opening a new window into the universe,” said Olga Botner of Uppsala University in Sweden, and a member of the Nobel committee for Physics that awarded the prize. “Einstein was obviously right again, and the prize goes to the leaders of the international team for the discovery that shook the world.” Advertisement Read more: Gravitational waves could show hints of extra dimensions  Botner, co-announcing the award by the Swedish Academy of Sciences, explained that the waves originated 1.3 billion years ago, from the collision between two distant black holes.  They were detected within 69 milliseconds apart at LIGO’s major detectors. The first trace at Hanford, Washington state, matched almost exactly the second at Livingston, Louisiana, 3000 kilometres away. Their perfect overlap allowed the team to rule out a false signal, said Botner. Laser discovery  LIGO used a pair of laser interferometers to measure a change thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus as the wave passed through the Earth. “The detectors are amazingly sensitive,” said Botner.  Weiss’s major contribution back in the 1970s at MIT was to find ways of cancelling out sources of background noise that could be mistaken for gravitational waves. “A passing truck or waves lapping against the ocean shore had to be excluded,” said Botner. Weiss pioneered ingenious ways of suspending mirrors that would capture the tiny movements caused by gravitational waves without any worldly disturbances.  Thorne, based at Caltech in Los Angeles, joined forces with Weiss to develop the interferometer itself, in collaboration with Scottish scientist, Ronald Drever, who passed away in March this year.  Barish took over the reins in 1994 as leader of LIGO and transformed what was a small research group of 40 into a major international collaboration of 1000 scientists .  Responding to the announcement today, Weiss said that the discovery would open new windows on sources of gravitational waves in the Universe. “We know about black holes and neutron stars, but we hope there are other phenomena we can see because of the gravitational waves they emit,” he said.",,,english,,,persons,barry barish,negative,null,2017-10-03T14:17:05.001+03:00,,,,

The idea that beef from cows raised on bucolic pastures is good for the environment, and that we can therefore eat as much meat as we want, doesn’t add up. New calculations suggest cattle pastures contribute to climate change.  “Sadly, though it would be nice if the pro-grazers were right, they aren’t,” says lead author Tara Garnett of the University of Oxford’s Food Climate Research Network. “The truth is, we cannot eat as much meat as we like and save the planet.”  Many meat eaters have long felt guilty that the beef steaks they love are bringing environmental disaster. Advertisement  A key problem is that microorganisms in the guts of cattle emit millions of tonnes of methane every year. A typical cow releases 100 kilograms of methane a year and the world has about a billion of them. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, this exacerbates global warming.  Meanwhile, feeding the beasts destroys forests by taking land for pasture or to grow feed – and this deforestation also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions .  But a counter-view has gained currency. First popularised by Zimbabwean ecologist and livestock farmer Allan Savory , and supported by organic farmers like Prince Charles , it argues that grazing cattle on pastures is actually good for the climate.  The idea is that plants on pastures capture carbon from the air, especially when fertilised by manure. Pastures should also reduce our need for food crops grown on land that releases carbon when ploughed. Doing the sums  Confused by conflicting claims, Garnett and her colleagues calculated the flow of greenhouse gases into and out of pastures. She found that “in some circumstances, you can get carbon capture, but not always and the effect is small. You cannot extrapolate from a nicely run Dorset farm to a global food strategy.”  At best, carbon capture only offsets 20 to 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from grazing, mostly the methane from cattle. “And the carbon capture stops after a few decades,” says Garnett, when the carbon-enriched soils reach equilibrium with the air. “Meanwhile, the cattle continue to belch methane.”  Her findings are published in a report, Grazed and Confused?  The analysis is more comprehensive than past studies, says Tim Benton at the University of Leeds, UK. “It asks, if we are to eat meat, is there a better way to grow it? The answer is: not really.” Less meat  Supporters of cattle grazing aren’t giving up just yet, though. Some say cattle have simply replaced wild ruminants, which also release methane. But Garnett points out that many cattle, especially in the tropics, graze on former forest land. In places such as the Brazilian Amazon, clearing trees for cattle causes massive greenhouse gas emissions.  At low densities of around one animal per hectare, carbon capture in soils could still exceed methane emissions, says Richard Young of the Sustainable Food Trust in Bristol, UK, which supports cattle grazing. However, he concedes that this isn’t true at higher densities.  Garnett’s conclusion is supported by a study published on 29 September, which found that methane emissions from cattle are 11 per cent larger than older methods would suggest, and thus a bigger contributor to global warming ( Carbon Balance and Management, doi.org/cdpz ).  “We need to reduce emissions from livestock,” says Benton. “That needs to come from dietary change.”  More on these topics: ",,,english,,,persons,garnett,none,null,2017-10-03T14:59:37.001+03:00,,,,

The implants included an artificial windpipe, a synthetic tear duct and an arterial graft.  The inquiry, led by Stephen Wigmore of the University of Edinburgh at the request of UCL, was triggered by the university’s relationship with Paolo Macchiarini , a surgeon at the centre of a scandal in which six of eight patients who received synthetic windpipes died. Advertisement  In 2016, Macchiarini, who held an honorary professorship at UCL, was fired from the Karolinska Institute for multiple violations.  The inquiry highlighted several cases of misconduct, including that involving a 36-year-old Eritrean man living in Iceland , who had a slow growing tumour in his trachea. Macchiarini made the clinical decision to remove the tumour and replace the affected segment of trachea with a synthetic graft. This graft was provided by Alexander Seifalian, who no longer works at UCL. Deep regret  The inquiry found that Seifalian’s laboratory was not licensed to make clinical grade devices and did not request permission to use the unlicensed devices. In a written testimony to the inquiry, Macchiarini indicated that he was not aware that the graft had not been made to clinical standard.  Seifalian welcomes the inquiry but stresses that his job was to do the basic research in the development of synthetic materials for biomedical applications. “The implantation was the job of the surgeon, who requires getting ethical approval and [regulatory] approval. This was not my job.”  “We see, time and time again, research scientists being made scapegoats for systemic problems,” he adds. “I am extremely proud of the excellent, innovative work we did at UCL and we continue to build on this to address global health challenges in a responsible and ethical manner.”  The inquiry discovered other documents that suggested plastic discs manufactured at the university but not approved for human use had been sent to Mumbai, India, where they had been implanted under the skin of a patient to test that the material was biocompatible.  An arterial graft and a synthetic tear duct also manufactured at UCL were used in operations despite not being made to accepted quality standards.  The inquiry made several recommendations to the University, including reviewing their honorary appointment process, working to improve oversight for products with clinical applications, and in assisting patients who interact with researchers.  In a statement, UCL said: “We deeply regret that materials that had not undergone rigorous preclinical assessment and which were not made to [approved] standards, were manufactured and supplied by Professor Alexander Seifalian’s research laboratory for direct clinical use. Our governance systems should have prevented that. We also regret the wider, negative impact that this work had on the field of regenerative medicine research.”  More on these topics: ",,,english,,,persons,seifalian,none,null,2017-10-04T03:48:02.002+03:00,,,,

Elmehed. © Nobel Media 2017 By Clare Wilson  The discovery of a way to see complex biological molecules in atomic resolution has won this year’s Nobel prize in Chemistry. The award has gone to Richard Henderson, Jacques Dubochet and Joachim Frank for developing cryo-electron microscopy, which cools down substances to liquid nitrogen temperatures.  Their techniques have recently let us see in unprecedented detail the surface of the Zika virus, bacterial proteins that cause antibiotic resistance, and tumour cell proteins that let cancers become resistant to chemotherapy.  Previous electron microscopes were less useful, partly because they need the sample to be placed in a vacuum. This causes surrounding water to evaporate, and the molecules being studied collapse and lose their normal structure. Electron microscopes were also too damaging, because they work by firing a beam of electrons at the sample. Advertisement  Richard Henderson of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, found a way to protect biomolecules by coating their surface with a glucose solution that stopped it from drying out in the vacuum. In 1975 his team produced the best picture of a protein ever made with an electron microscope, with their imaging of a bacterial molecule called bacteriorhodopsin, showing how it crossed the cell membrane seven times.  Joachim Frank of Columbia University in New York developed an image-processing method that merges many two-dimensional images of a biomolecules to create a sharp three-dimensional picture.  And Jacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland developed a technique for vitrifying water – cooling it down so quickly that it solidifies in liquid form around the biomolecule, so it keeps its normal shape, even in a vacuum.  Together the work of all three led to a burgeoning new field. At first the images produced, though useful, were somewhat shapeless – leading cryo-electron microscopy to be dubbed “blobology”. But numerous refinements over the years has made the resulting images sharper than ever, producing a stream of new discoveries about life’s most complex and intricate machinary.

But the real risks of AI are subtler and more tricky to handle Modern Toss By Michael Brooks  ON A server farm somewhere – I imagine Nevada or New Mexico, but apparently it’s more likely to be northern Virginia – there is a recording of my wife talking in our kitchen. She didn’t know she was being recorded, but then she hadn’t read the terms and conditions of Amazon’s digital assistant, Echo. On the recording, which I can access and play back as often as I like, she’s asking me why Echo is more popularly known as Alexa.  “Why choose Alexa?” she says. “There must be a reason.”  Seasoned users of Echo will know that Alexa wakes up and starts listening – and recording – at the mention of her name. But actually she records the moments before her name. That suggests she must always be listening, surely? I can feel the paranoia begin.  Paranoia is a common reaction of human intelligence to artificial intelligence . We are both thrilled and disturbed by the prospect of machines that can respond to us as a human would – and at some level even seem to be human.  Certainly there is no lack of dire warnings of AI’s dangers. It is watching us, destroying our privacy and perverting our public discourse. It’s out to steal our jobs – and may ultimately destroy humanity itself.  I don’t know who or what to believe. Is anybody even asking the right questions? Alexa, why are you called Alexa?

Lepp/Corbis/Getty By Chris Baraniuk  There are always better restaurants in the city, and that could be making the town mice of New York genetically distinct from their country cousins.  Stephen Harris at the State University of New York and Jason Munshi-South of Fordham University in New York City caught 48 white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) from three New York parks and three nearby rural areas. The mice are native to this part of North America, so the pair wanted to find out whether some had begun to evolve for city living.  They examined the mice’s RNA to see if the rural and urban populations expressed different genes. Ultimately, they homed in on 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): places in the genome where a single letter varies from mouse to mouse. Advertisement  Several SNPs were in genes associated with digestion and other metabolic processes. One highlighted gene was used to produce omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. A version of this gene appears to have been selected for in humans as we moved from hunter-gathering to agriculture.  The work is “at the forefront of biology”, says Jonathan Richardson at Providence College in Rhode Island. The cheeseburger hypothesis  The survey also highlighted genes linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which may result from having to process a lot of fatty acids. This could be due to a diet rich in fast foods. “The first thing that we thought of was the ‘cheeseburger hypothesis’: urban mice subsidising their diet on human food waste,” says Harris. If so, the mice may be like “Pizza Rat”, a New York rodent videoed carrying a whole slice of pizza.  In line with this, city mice had larger livers with more scar tissue, says Harris, who was at the City University of New York when most of the work was done. However, the sample size was too small to be sure.  Besides, New York offers other foods, like seeds, nuts and berries in its parks. Such resources are more plentiful than in rural areas, where there is more competition from other species.  The mice may be enjoying an eclectic mix of urban food resources, says Richardson, occasionally boosting their calorie intake by dining on human food waste.  The next step will be to examine the function of these genes more closely to assess their impact on fitness and selection, says Hopi Hoekstra at Harvard University.  Hoekstra says the work is part of a wave of studies investigating examples of rapid adaptation. “That provides us with a really cool way to study evolutionary change, sort of as it’s happening,” she says.

A road map will be launched today that describes how the partners plan to cut deaths from the water-borne bacteria – now running at 95,000 a year – by 90 per cent by 2030 .  That will mean eliminating cholera from 20 of the 47 countries that have it, and enabling the rest to detect and stop outbreaks before they get out of control, according to this Global Task Force on Cholera Control.  The challenge is daunting. Three million people get cholera every year, in Asia, Africa and Haiti, and increasing urbanisation and temperatures will put more people at risk. In Yemen, the biggest epidemic in modern times is now approaching 800,000 cases, and is growing. Emergency experts say a “catastrophic” outbreak looms in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh. Advertisement  We already have the tools to stop this, says Peter Salama , head of emergency operations at the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland. Cholera spreads in water containing infected faeces. Rich countries banished it a century ago, not with vaccines, but with toilets and hygiene. Falling funding  In poor countries, 2 billion people drink from water sources contaminated with faeces and 2.4 billion have no toilets, according to the WHO. Yet aid from rich countries to build sewage systems has fallen.  The WHO says spending on sanitation must prioritise “hotspots” where cholera lurks all the time. Spending on cholera goes mostly to contain outbreaks in new places, leaving hotspots as continued sources of disease.  The task force’s road map calls for coordinated investments – and for deployment of the real game changer, an oral cholera vaccine that has proved over the past few years that it can quickly contain outbreaks. Nearly a million doses are already en route for Bangladesh.  “This disease doesn’t deserve to be in this century,” says Seth Berkley , head of the vaccine agency Gavi in Geneva. “We can make this a reality.”  More on these topics:",,,english,,,persons,seth berkley,none,null,2017-10-04T15:31:46.004+03:00,,,,

By scanning slumbering people, researchers have watched how the “trace” of a memory moves from one region of the brain to another.  “The initial memory trace kind of disappears, and at the same time, another emerges,” says Shahab Vahdat at Stanford University in California. It is the first time memories have been observed being filed away in humans during sleep, he says.  Vahdat and his colleagues did this by finding people who were able to fall asleep in the confined, noisy space of an fMRI scanner, which is no easy undertaking. “We screened more than 50 people in a mock scanner, and only 13 made it through to the study,” says Vahdat. Advertisement  The team then taught this group of volunteers to press a set of keys in a specific sequence – in the same way that a pianist might learn to play a tune. It took each person between about 10 and 20 minutes to master a sequence involving five presses. “They had to learn to play it as quickly and as accurately as possible,” says Vahdat.  Once they had learned the sequence, each volunteer put on a cap of EEG electrodes to monitor the electrical activity of their brain, and entered an fMRI scanner – which detects which regions of the brain are active.  The team saw a specific pattern of brain activity while the volunteers performed the key-pressing task. Once they had stopped, this pattern kept replaying, as if each person was subconsciously revising what they had learned.  The volunteers were then asked to go to sleep, while the team monitored each of them for two-and-a-half hours. At first, the pattern of brain activity continued to replay in the outer region of the brain called the cortex, which is involved in higher thought.  When the volunteers entered non-REM sleep – known as the stage when we have relatively mundane dreams – the pattern started to fade in the cortex, but a similar pattern of activity started in the putamen, a region deep within the brain ( eLife , doi.org/cdsz ). “The memory trace evolved during sleep,” says Vahdat.  His team thinks that movement-related memories are transferred to deeper brain regions for long-term storage. This chimes with the hypothesis that the brain’s cortex must free up space so that it can continue to learn new information, says Christoph Nissen at University Psychiatric Services in Bern, Switzerland.  Non-REM sleep happens within a few hours of dozing off, says Vahdat. If you’re hoping for some night-time learning, it’s important to make sure that those first few hours are uninterrupted , he says.  Nissen hopes a better understanding of how memories are consolidated during sleep could lead to treatments for people with insomnia and similar sleep disorders. Such individuals tend to be treated with drugs that send them to sleep, but Nissen has found that this sleep doesn’t seem to be as good at consolidating memories as natural sleep.

Apple and implant manufacturer Cochlear have made “Made for iPhone” connectivity available for any hearing implants that use the next-generation Nucleus 7 sound processor. The advance means that these implants can also stream music and Netflix shows.  The technology was first unveiled in 2014 when it was added to hearing aids such as the Starkey Halo and ReSound LiNX. But this is the first time it’s been linked into the central nervous system.  While some cochlear implants already offer Bluetooth connectivity, these often require users to wear extra dongles or other intermediary devices to pick up digital signals, and then rebroadcast them to the hearing aid as radio. This technology simply beams the signal right into the brain. Advertisement  It’s also a better way to use Bluetooth. Bluetooth headsets have been commonplace since the early 2000s, but the energy-sapping technology has meant they are typically clunky devices with poor battery life.  In 2014, Apple technicians developed a way to stream audio over the low energy Bluetooth format used by wearables such as FitBits. Now, tiny devices like hearing aids – and Apple’s Airpods — can stream audio signals for up to a week on a battery the size of an aspirin.  There is a small cost – the audio signal is highly compressed, and can sound much flatter than sounds from typical Bluetooth headsets. That’s unlikely to be a problem for cochlear implant users, as these devices can only stimulate a limited number of frequencies in the ear anyway — because of this low sound quality, cochlear implants are reserved for those with profound hearing loss .  However, the technology behind the new audio streaming models is likely to be adopted by consumer audio devices. Technology giants are betting heavily on audio interfaces becoming the norm in the future , all the better to further integrate voice-activated assistants such as Siri, OK Google, Cortana and Alexa into our daily routines.  It’s likely that in the future most of us will wear discreet, “transparent” ear buds that allow us to hear the world around us while also allowing us to field calls, texts, emails, and hear updates and directions directly from our phone .

The cortex is the thin, highly folded outer layer of our brains and it is home to some of our most sophisticated mental abilities, such as planning, language and complex thoughts.  Around three millimetres thick, this layer is folded into an intricate pattern of ridges and valleys, which allows the cortex to be large, but still fit into a relatively small space. Many larger mammals, such as primates, dolphins and horses, have various patterns of folds in their cortex, but folds are rarer in smaller animals like mice. Advertisement  So far, we have only identified a few genetic mutations that contributed to the evolution of the human brain, including ones that boosted the number of cells in the cortex. One theory about how the cortex came to be folded is that it buckled as the layer of cells expanded .  Daniel del Toro at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Munich, Germany, and colleagues wondered if some of the genetic changes in our brain’s evolution might have been about more than just an increasing number of cells. They investigated the genes for two molecules – FLRT1 and FLRT3 – which make developing brain cells stick to each other more. “If brain cells are less sticky, they may form more complex structures within the cortex”  Human brain cells produce only a small amount of these compounds, while mice brain cells make lots. Del Toro’s team created mice embryos that lacked functioning FLRT1 and FLRT3 genes, which meant their cortex cells were only loosely attached to each other, like those of humans.  When the genetically altered mice were born and grew into adults, they had more folded brains. This finding was presented at the Cortex Evolution and Development conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, last month. But it is still unclear if these mice are smarter – that is what the team plans to study next.  Why would less sticky brain cells lead to a folded cortex? As a human fetus develops, new brain cells are produced in the middle of the head, and then move outwards until they reach the surface and become the cortex. Del Toro speculates that the stickier cells in normal mice might make the cortex layer too rigid to deform into wrinkles. “Imagine a line of people running together holding hands,” he says. “At the end, they all arrive at the same time.”  The looser bonding of human brain cells might also allow them to migrate at different speeds and so form more complex structures within the cortex, says del Toro.  But it is too soon to conclude that this was a key change in our evolutionary history, says Todd Preuss at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University, Georgia, because the study only compared humans and mice. “It would be interesting to see what these genes are doing in other primates and mammals.”  This article appeared in print under the headline “How we got our folded brains?”  More on these topics:",,,english,,,persons,todd preuss,none,null,2017-10-04T19:35:09.000+03:00,,,,

So say scientists who have analysed sediment from the South China Sea – but not everyone is convinced.  Several early civilisations hit a crisis point about 4000 years ago . The global climate cooled, and this has been linked to the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in ancient Mesopotamia, the end of the Indus valley civilisation of South Asia and the fall of the Liangzhu culture in what is now eastern China.  Cooling was also felt on Hainan island off China’s southern coast, according to Fangjian Xu at the China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, Bangqi Hu at the Qingdao Institute of Marine Geology, and their colleagues. The cooling led to an increase in heavy metal pollution in the South China Sea. Advertisement  Xu and his colleagues looked at two sediment cores from just south-east of Hainan. They calculated “enrichment factors” for several metals. A value of 1 or below indicates no enrichment, while values between 1 and 3 suggest “minor enrichment” . Farms not fish  The enrichment factors of cadmium and lead hovered around 1 before the 4000-year mark, but afterwards increased to about 1.5. In other words, human activity on Hainan 4000 years ago led to a subtle but detectable uptick in heavy metal pollution in the South China Sea, says the team.  The group suggests that the change was linked to the global cooling at the time, when Hainan would have cooled and dried. Lower monsoon activity would have triggered a reduction in coastal upwelling, lowering marine productivity and encouraging Hainan’s inhabitants to focus on farming rather than fishing.  Run-off into the sea from farms would have included heavy metals, which were accumulating in soil because of the use of metal tools.  Samuel Toucanne at the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea in Plouzané was involved in a 2015 analysis of South China Sea sediment from further west , derived from the Red River that runs through China and Vietnam. There, the evidence of human-related pollution from lead, copper and arsenic began only 1800 years ago. Questionable link  Toucanne says the uptick in pollution 4000 years ago is gradual rather than clear-cut. “But they use this precise age to discuss global climate and the relationship with human activities,” he says. It is questionable whether there is a direct link between the climate cooling 4000 years ago and the increase in pollution off Hainan.  There is also evidence of increased precipitation on some parts of Hainan in response to the climate change , says James Innes at Durham University, UK. “So increased aridity at Hainan around this time isn’t for certain.”  Still, Innes thinks the proposed scenario is plausible. “Declining productivity offshore could have led to increased agriculture on Hainan island,” he says.  However, Peter Clift at Louisiana State University is unconvinced. He says other evidence suggests pollution from metalworking on the mainland only began to affect the South China Sea about 2000 years ago . “I find it difficult to believe that little Hainan island was much more developed 4000 years ago.”  However, there is precedent for significant pollution that long ago. In 2013, Francisco Jiménez-Espejo at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology in Yokosuka found lead pollution in the Iberian peninsula about 4000 years ago . He has since found evidence that archaic humans like Neanderthals caused localised heavy metal pollution . “But the amount we are talking is so low that it is not considered harmful or dangerous for human [health],” says Jiménez-Espejo.

We are used to getting lots of warning before an earthquake – and this time, we didn’t.  Since 1993, Mexico City has had a fully operational earthquake early warning system. When a magnitude 8.1 quake struck on 8 September, the city got over a minute of warning.  But 19 September’s quake showed that the system can’t handle all types of events. The limited warning it gave holds lessons for all countries working to give their citizens a head start. Advertisement  “This event in Mexico City is critical,” says Richard Allen at the University of California, Berkeley.  Mexico’s warning system was born after a 1985 earthquake that levelled parts of the city and claimed thousands of lives. Mexico’s unique quakes meant the system was particularly viable.  The quakes are generated by two continental plates that meet along much of Mexico’s west coast. Mexico City lies hundreds of kilometres away, so it ought to be safe. But the city was built on a loose lakebed topped with looser landfill. This soil picks up tremors from far away. In 1985, shifting soil went on toppling buildings long after the quake had petered out.  However, with such a long distance between the epicentre and the city, scientists could create a warning system. Today, a 1985-style quake on the coast will trigger alarms in Mexico City 60 to 90 seconds before it arrives.  “If you have minutes, you can empty any school practically anywhere,” says Gerardo Suarez at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.  But the warning on 19 September was more like 0 to 5 seconds. That’s because the quake began elsewhere in the plate boundary, deeper and closer to the city. It was more the sort of tremor that could strike California. “In my house, the warning arrived at the same time as the first shocks. Others slipped down the stairwell”  For decades, Allen pushed California to build a warning system. In 2014, he got federal funding and in 2018 a prototype will start issuing limited alerts. Unlike Mexico’s system, it will only give about 10 seconds of warning.  There are many pitfalls. What if it gives too many false alarms, so people ignore them and are caught out by quakes? What if the system misses the big one? And what if 10 seconds just isn’t enough time? Understanding what Mexicans did in such a short window might help the US.  It won’t be easy. In my house, the warning arrived at the same time as the first shocks. Others say they ended up in a pile of people slipping and falling down the stairwell.  “What are you going to do with a 5, 8, 10-second warning?” Suarez wonders. His wife was able to leave the store she was shopping in and get to the street, but she was lucky. He says most people won’t be able to do much except duck under their desks.  However, even if people cannot do much in mere seconds, computers can do plenty. Suarez says many responses could be automated. Computers could halt trains, stop elevators at the next floor and warn surgeons. He also suggests broadcasting a countdown so people know how long they have.  There are limits to warning systems. A recent study found no way to tell if a brewing quake will be huge until it’s too late (Science, doi.org/cdd6 ). So it will always be a matter of seconds. The trick will be to make the best use of those seconds to save lives.  “I personally believe that no children should die below the rubble of their own school,” Suarez says.

What if your accountant likes to go base jumping at the weekend – might she be more likely to take risks with your money than someone who relaxes by playing golf instead?  The answer to both seems to be yes. The most comprehensive study yet into how people respond to risk has found there is a common component that drives all types of risk-taking.  How eager we are to engage in risky activities is known as our risk preference. Psychologists consider this a key component of human behaviour because its impact on our decision-making has consequences – often dramatic ones – for so many aspects of our lives. Advertisement  Despite its importance, there is a lack of consensus over whether people’s tendency to take risks is consistent or whether it varies depending on the type of risk. To find out, Renato Frey at the University of Basel in Switzerland and his colleagues asked 1500 adults to complete 39 tests commonly used to measure risk preference in different scenarios.  Controlling for age and gender, they found that 61 per cent of the variation in an individual’s scores across the tests could be explained by a single component, with the rest of the variation explained by factors specific to the different types of risk. G whizz  This is similar to how we understand intelligence. Because people who excel at one cognitive test tend to do so on them all, psychologists often talk about a general factor of intelligence , known as g, to explain this across-the-board performance. If you have a high g score, you are likely to do well on any type of cognitive test. But how well you do on any one test will also depend on other factors, such as you possessing abilities that are helpful for that specific test.  Frey and his team’s results suggest that people’s risk preference scores can be explained by both a general component they call R, and seven specific components that relate to different types of risk. The general component could be driven by mechanisms such as a person’s risk perception, their genetic disposition or level of understanding of risk – common factors that would apply no matter what the situation.  Specific factors such as recreational risk-taking could be explained by things like an individual’s desire for thrilling experiences, or problems with disinhibition could underlie risky health behaviours such as smoking or drinking to excess.  The existence of the general component, plus the finding that people’s R value was fairly consistent when the team retested participants after six months, suggests that risk preference should be considered an enduring psychological trait like intelligence, says Frey.  “Risk preference seems to have a core, stable component, like other personality traits, and is not something which is entirely ‘created’ in the moment as a function of external stimuli, the context or the environment,” says Matteo Galizzi at the London School of Economics.  This means we could start to explore the biological foundations of risky behaviour and use it to help people. “If you could identify someone from their genes or neural anatomy who was likely to be highly prone to taking risks in adolescence or later in life, you could teach that person to be aware of risks and the potential dangers involved,” says Frey.

Just like physical exercise, the kind of improvements you get depends on exactly how you train – and most of us are doing it all wrong.  That the brain changes physically when we learn a new skill, like juggling or playing a musical instrument, has been known for over a decade. Previous studies had suggested that meditation does something similar for parts of the brain involved in focused attention.  Two new studies published in Science Advances suggest that certain kinds of meditation can change social and emotional circuitry, too. The research comes out of the ReSource Project at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, and looked at the effects of three different meditation techniques on the brains and bodies of more than 300 volunteers over 9 months. Advertisement  One technique was based on mindfulness meditation , and taught people to direct attention to the breath or body. A second type concentrated on compassion and emotional connection via loving kindness meditations and non-judgmental problem-sharing sessions with a partner. A final method encouraged people to think about issues from different points of view, also via a mix of partnered sessions and solo meditation.  In one study , MRI scans taken after each three-month course showed that parts of the cortex involved in the specific skill that was trained grew thicker in comparison with scans from a control group.  Mindfulness meditation increased thickness in the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobes, both linked to attention control, while compassion-based meditation showed increases in the limbic system, which processes emotions, and the anterior insula, which helps bring emotions into conscious awareness. Perspective-taking training boosted regions involved in theory of mind .  All of the brain changes were matched by improvements in tests of the relevant skills. Just like exercise  Tania Singer, a social neuroscientist and the lead researcher on the study, says that meditation courses should be better designed for specific outcomes, just as exercise programmes might target certain physical weaknesses. “It’s like asking a sport expert ‘what does sport do to your body’. The expert would say, do you mean swimming or horse-riding? You can imagine mental training being as complex,” she says.  Roi Cohen Kadosh, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, thinks the findings are potentially important. “We still have to see how it affects everyday life. But if there are changes in real life, that could be pretty significant,” he says. He also points out that all the volunteers first did mindfulness meditation, so it is an open question is whether any change depends on first having done some attention training. But, he says, “it’s progress”.  A second study looked at meditation’s impact on stress levels in the same volunteers. Many studies have reported that meditation makes people feel calmer, but the effects on levels of the stress hormone cortisol have been mixed. The problem could be that meditation tends to be a solo activity.  The researchers found that mindfulness meditation alone made the volunteers feel calmer when asked to give a presentation at short notice, but their cortisol levels were no different from those in controls.  After engaging in face-to-face sessions with a partner in addition to compassion or perspective-based meditation, however, volunteers showed up to a 51 per cent drop in cortisol levels compared with controls.  Singer says this is important because most of the stress that we experience in modern life is social stress: the fear of being judged harshly or falling short of expectations. This kind of stress is linked to mental health problems and disease, and the new findings suggest that mindfulness meditation alone may not save us from it.  When it does work, Singer says, it’s probably down to the social aspect of attending a meditation group rather than the practice itself. “It’s not just getting calm [that’s responsible],” she says.

Her “load theory” proposes this works because attention is a limited resource, so if you fill all the attentional “slots” in your mind, it leaves no room for other distractions. 2. Bribe yourself  The prospect of a treat can keep people focused , but only when it is well-timed, studies show. Offering people small rewards throughout a boring task didn’t stop them from losing focus, but the promise of a larger reward that they would receive at the end of the task kept them alert. This approach probably works best with an accomplice to keep you from caving early, says Michael Esterman , at the Boston Attention and Learning Laboratory, who did the research. “It’s hard to fool yourself.” Daydreaming need not be the enemy of focus. Learn to do it right and you could reap the benefits from more successful revision to more motivation 3. Test yourself  We’re currently finding that there’s more than one way your mind can wander, and that knowing how to navigate your daydreams could save you come exam time. One trick is to make sure your mind is wandering about the stuff you need to learn . To do that, test yourself often. People retained more of a boring lecture if they paused to test what they remembered every 5 minutes. Their minds still wandered, but wandered on topic, rather than anything but . 4. Daydream during breaks  Stopping every now and again to give your mind a chance to wander can invigorate focus, says psychologist Paul Seli of Harvard University. “If you say to yourself, now I’m going to think about something unrelated, maybe problem-solve something else that is on your mind, and then come back to your task. That can definitely be beneficial,” he says. 5. De-stress  You might think that an adrenaline boost would focus the mind, but stress actually stimulates the release of hormones, including noradrenaline, which bind to receptors in the cognitive control circuits. This in turn makes it harder for them to keep tabs on mind wandering. 6. Get some zeds  A lack of sleep hammers mental performance in general, and reduces our ability to resist both internal and external distractions. And there’s an added bonus – sleep is also important for memory consolidation. In fact, recent research suggests that if you have an hour spare before an exam, a nap could be a more effective use of your time than spending it revising. 7. Doodle  In one study, people forced to listen to a boring voice recording were able to remember more afterwards if they were allowed to doodle. But content is important. Doodling about something related to what you are trying to remember is more likely to qualify as intentional mind wandering, which can help you focus on the task at hand. Don’t be too elaborate, however – if your doodles become too engaging, the whole thing might backfire.

We’re finally working out how to fight it Robert Carter By Caroline Williams  JOB, kids, mortgage, bills, groceries, housework… coping with modern life can sometimes feel like a remorseless treadmill. Many of us end up exhausted, with a vague feeling that all this pressure can’t be doing us any good. But we do it anyway, driven by the notion that stress is for wimps. And there’s always a glass of wine and a takeaway to look forward to at the end of the week.  Big mistake. Far from being for wimps, physical and psychological stress are major triggers of a modern scourge that has been linked with every malady from heart disease, depression and chronic pain to neurodegenerative diseases. That scourge is inflammation. Until recently, we have known little about how what starts as a protective immune process in the body goes awry, and there have been frustratingly few evidence-based suggestions on what we should do about it. But now we are starting to learn more about how the process works, how it connects body and mind, and what we might do to keep it in check. This new understanding is leading to treatments that may finally let us douse this constant fire – not by stopping it from happening, but by turning it off when it is no longer useful.  Such treatments could benefit the millions of people around the world who have chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and coeliac disease. They could also assist those of us who want to have our cake, eat it and not end up inflamed . Finding a way to manage inflammation could help prevent modern life from damaging our long-term physical health. To continue reading this premium article, subscribe for unlimited access.

Why prime numbers clump the way they do is one of the most maddening problems in mathematics – and thanks to an unlikely hero we’re starting to crack it Ellen Porteus By Vicky Neale  IT WAS the British mathematician G.H. Hardy who popularised the idea that youthful brains do the best maths. “I do not know of a major mathematical advance initiated by a man past fifty”, he wrote in A Mathematician’s Apology , a lament for the decline of his own creativity that he published in 1940 at the age of 62. “If a man of mature age loses interest in and abandons mathematics , the loss is not likely to be very serious either for mathematics or for himself.”  If blooming youth is the rule, Yitang Zhang is a definite exception. For the best part of a decade after completing his PhD, he wasn’t even working as a mathematician, instead doing odd accounting jobs around Kentucky. At one point he did a stint working in a Subway fast-food restaurant. When he announced a mathematical breakthrough that had eluded his peers for a couple of centuries, he was 57.  What Zhang made public in 2013 wasn’t a proof of the hallowed “twin primes conjecture”, but it was a significant step towards one. And even if things haven’t quite panned out in the years since, he has inspired work that is promising new insights into the prime numbers, the most beguiling numbers of all.  Primes are those numbers greater than 1 that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. The sequence begins 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 and goes on… well, as long as you like.

Bates  Snakes fed a diet of toxic toads become toxic too — and they seem to know it.  While many snakes make their own toxins, not all do. Japan’s tiger keelback snake ( Rhabdophis tigrinus ) is one of a handful of species that can store toxins it acquires from its food.  Tiger keelback snakes are usually less than a metre long, an ideal meal for many birds and mammals. But they eat toxic toads and store the toxins in specialised organs on the backs of their necks called nuchal glands . Advertisement  If a snake is threatened it arches its neck, making the nuchal gland area more prominent. A predator that bit the snake’s neck would probably get a jet of fluid from the glands straight in the mouth or face, which would be distasteful or even painful.  But not all keelbacks exhibit this defensive behaviour. Snakes from a toad-free island flee when attacked, rather than standing their ground. Now it seems the snakes know whether or not they are armed with toxins.  Akira Mori of Kyoto University, Japan, and Gordon Burghardt of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville reared hatchling snakes from toad-free and toad-rich Japanese islands. The snakes were fed controlled diets containing toxic toads – or not.  When snakes from the toad-free island were fed toads, they started responding to threats with nuchal gland displays, rather than slithering away. Know thyself  “So far as I know, this is the only example in terrestrial vertebrates where there is some indication that animals act as if they are aware of when they are toxic and when they are not,” says Burghardt.  Apart from snakes, plenty of animals acquire toxins from what they eat, but Burghardt says there is no sign they change their behaviour depending on what they have eaten. “Poison dart frogs in captivity are not fed the types of food that make them toxic, but their behaviour towards predators does not seem to have changed at all,” he says.  “It is remarkable that the researchers were able to demonstrate not only a difference in behaviour between these two populations, but that if you feed toads to toxin-free snakes, they are able to adjust their behaviour in a manner consistent with being chemically defended,” says Alan Savitzky of Utah State University in Logan.  How they know is an open question. The snakes could somehow monitor the amount of toxin in their glands. Alternatively, they might detect changes in the microbial community living in their digestive system, which would be influenced by toxin levels.

SOHO/NASA By Lean Crane  We don’t yet know what dark matter is made of, but the sun might help us find out. If dark matter particles are extremely light, they could bounce off atomic nuclei within the sun and gain enough energy in the process that we could detect them.  Chris Kouvaris at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense and his colleagues calculate that particles of this “sub-GeV” dark matter could be accelerated to speeds in excess of 600 kilometres per second in this way.  Dark matter permeates the cosmos, so if these sub-GeV particles exist some of them should be hitting the sun all the time. As they bounce around within the sun, some would gain enough speed to escape towards Earth. Advertisement  Faster particles are easier to detect because they have more energy, so this solar boost could be the key to making dark matter visible to us.  But the sub-GeV dark matter particles will need to interact with the normal matter in our detectors. For this to happen, they will need a helper particle to mediate that interaction. For example, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), another leading contender for dark matter, interact with ordinary matter by exchanging subatomic particles called W and Z bosons.  “There are basically two particles that are needed: you need the dark matter particles, and you need some other particle for them to interact through,” says Daniel McKinsey at the University of California, Berkeley. “Some of my more sceptical colleagues would say that it’s like believing in two tooth fairies. I say, if you believe in one tooth fairy, why not two?”  McKinsey says this idea is still a “big deal”, because it gives us an entirely new way to look for dark matter after decades of fruitless searching. Need for speed  The upper speed limit for particles to remain inside our galaxy is 544 kilometres per second. If they go any faster than that, gravity won’t be able to keep them within the Milky Way.  “If it has a larger velocity than the escape velocity of the galaxy, then it’ll go out of the galaxy and we’ll never be able to detect it,” says Kouvaris. Unless, that is, Earth gets in the way – a prospect that is much more likely if the particles are accelerated to such high speeds by our sun.  Current detectors aren’t sensitive enough to see any of these particles that happen to hit our planet after getting a boost from the sun. But upcoming instruments like the upgraded CRESST-III detector in Italy may be able to detect them.  Dark matter makes up over 80 per cent of the universe’s mass, so if the new detectors do find these particles, Kouvaris and McKinsey agree, it’ll be the biggest discovery in modern physics. And if they don’t, researchers will simply have to find new ways to look. ",,,english,,,,,,null,2017-10-05T19:06:11.000+03:00,,,,

Burton/Getty By Douglas Heaven  The internet has a personality problem . Abusive behaviour is a scourge in most corners of the internet, from website comments sections to social media to chat sessions in online games. Attempts to clamp down have yielded frustrating results – the concept is just too slippery. But a new way of automatically identifying the subtle linguistic fingerprints of true hate speech – and separating it from more benign uses of similar words – could finally help crack down on the worst offenders.  “Hate speech is notoriously difficult to detect,” says Dana Warmsley at Cornell University in New York. Simply using offensive language does not make someone abusive. People swear for all sorts of reasons. Friends call each other names for fun. Advertisement  Most platforms rely on their users to report abuse. But human moderators cannot keep up with the torrent of objectionable content.  Another option is to detect hate speech automatically. Earlier this year, Google tried to assign comments a “toxic” score based on how similar they were to other phrases people had previously deemed offensive. However, the shortcomings overwhelmed the positive effects. “you’re pretty smart for a girl” was deemed 18 per cent similar to comments people had deemed toxic, whereas “i love Fuhrer” was 2 per cent similar.  So Haji Mohammad Saleem at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and his colleagues went for a different approach. Instead of focusing on isolated words and phrases, they taught machine learning software to spot hate speech by learning how members of hateful communities speak . They trained their system on a data dump that contains most of the posts made to Reddit between 2006 and 2016. They focused on three groups who are often the target of abuse: African Americans, overweight people and women. For each of these, they chose the most active support and abuse groups on Reddit to train their software. They also took comments from Voat – a forum site similar to Reddit – as well as individual websites dedicated to hate speech. Offensive speech  The team found that their approach contained fewer false positives than a keyword-based detector. For example, it was able to flag comments that contained no offensive keyword, such as “I don’t see the problem here. Animals attack other animals all the time,” in which the term “animals” was being used as a racist slur.  “Comparing hateful and non-hateful communities to find the language that distinguishes them is a clever solution,” says Thomas Davidson at Cornell University, who – together with Warmsley – has trained machine learning software to tell the difference between offensive and inoffensive speech by feeding it hand-picked examples of both.  But he is not convinced the solution is as widely applicable as Saleem and his colleagues suggest. The team tested their system on Reddit comments but they have not shown that it will catch targeted abuse on Twitter or Facebook, for example.  “It’s a sensible approach but it won’t catch everything,” says Joanna Bryson at the University of Bath, UK. The system still missed clearly offensive speech, such as “Black people are terrible” and others that are clearly racist, or fat-shaming. Bryson points out that a keyword-based approach would have caught these comments.  But it could be yet another tool in the hands of competent moderators. Despite the difficulties, there may be no way to avoid keeping humans in the loop. “Ultimately, hate speech is a subjective phenomenon that requires human judgment to identify,” says Davidson.

Lee Grismer By Michael Le Page  The number of known species of geckos has just jumped upwards, with 15 new species being formally described this week.  “And if you count the four I’m looking at right now it’s 19,” says Lee Grismer of La Sierra University in California. “When you called I was in the process of describing them.”  This is a big increase, as there are only around 1500 known species of these lizards, famed for the sticking power of their feet . Advertisement  The 19 species all live in a small area of Myanmar just 90 by 50 kilometres in size. “That’s the really amazing thing about it,” says Grismer. “They all come from such a small area.”  It’s common to find lots of closely-related species of invertebrates like snails or insects in such a small area, but it is unprecedented for a backboned animal, say Grismer. “For lizards, it is remarkable.” Another new Cyrtodactylus gecko L. Lee Grismer  The reason is likely to do with the unusual landscape. In an otherwise-flat lowland area, great blocks of limestone rise up to 400 metres high. Their surfaces are highly corrugated and sculpted by erosion, and sometimes riddled with caves.  These limestone blocks, some just a kilometre across, are evolutionary islands where isolated geckos have evolved into separate species. The limestone-dwelling geckos tend to have longer legs and toes, and more slender bodies, than their lowland kin.  Grismer’s team was asked to explore the area in Myanmar by the charity Fauna & Flora International , which is campaigning to preserve the unusual limestone habitat. The new geckos all lived in the same small area L. Lee Grismer  In their first trip in 2016, the team found the first 15 geckos, as well as new snakes and frogs. “It was fricking crazy, man,” says Grismer. “In 19 days we found 23 new species.”  In a later trip, they found the four geckos yet to be formally described.  While the newly found geckos are restricted to tiny areas, they are abundant there, maybe because they are safe from many of the predators on the surrounding plains.  “It’s like you’re the only one who occupies a 7-Eleven,” says Grismer. “It may not be a Wal-Mart, but it’s all yours.” Hemiphyllodactylus montawaensis L. Lee Grismer  Some of the blocks are being mined for limestone, and there were explosions nearby as the team worked, says Grismer. But other blocks have caves regarded as sacred by Buddhists, and these are fiercely guarded by monks.  Most of the new species of gecko belong to a large genus collectively known as bent-toed geckos . But to Grismer’s surprise, the team also found three species of dwarf gecko, which are usually found only on cloudy mountaintops .

Edward Marti/JILA By Aylin Woodward  It’s about time. The most precise atomic clock ever made has been created by arranging strontium atoms in a grid-like pattern and then stacking those grids like pancakes.  Most atomic clocks use atoms of the isotope caesium-133. The ticking of time is measured through microwaves emitted by the electrons around those atoms jumping from a lower to higher orbit as they absorb and then lose energy from a laser.  But these clocks are constrained in how precisely they can divide time because caesium electrons have a speed limit: they can only jump back and forth 9 billion times per second. The electrons in strontium atoms can transition nearly 1 million billion times per second. Advertisement  “In 2014, the world’s most accurate optical clock wouldn’t lose or gain one second in the entire age of the universe ,” says Jun Ye at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Previous caesium clocks kept time accurately to within a second over the course of 300 million years.  Now, Ye’s group has built a strontium clock that is so precise, out of every 10 quintillion ticks only 3.5 would be out of sync – the first atomic clock ever to reach that level of precision. Controlling the atoms  To build a more precise clock, Ye and his team designed a 3D structure that let them measure signals from more atoms at once within the width of the laser beam. But if you pack in too many, the signal can get blurred by collisions between atoms.  The latticework enabled the researchers to survey atoms that were much more densely packed together – 10 trillion atoms per cubic centimetre compared with previous clocks with 10 billion atoms per cubic centimetre – and have better control of those atoms’ interactions, minimising how often they crash into each other.  They cooled the atoms to -273˚C and trapped each one in its own spot to control the interactions between them. “Imagine a scenario where you have single-person housing in a city block. One person lives in each house and neighbours are never allowed in,” says Ye. “Each atom fits in one particular site.”  Ye says the ultracold temperatures turn the atoms into what is known as a quantum gas. “When atoms in the gaseous phase are very hot, they’re moving apart and colliding with each other,” he says. “This changes when you lower the temperature of the gas so much that these particles start to move like waves – they start to avoid each other.” Time will tell  More precise clocks will allow us to test theories like Einstein’s general relativity – which says clocks run differently should they experience different gravitational forces – and search for gravitational waves that alter the passage of time in deep space.  Although it is the most precise atomic clock ever made, it hasn’t run long enough to confirm how accurate it will remain over time, Ye says.  Christian Lisdat at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Germany is interested in how the 3D-lattice arrangement will influence the clock’s accuracy, but he is convinced the results are sound. “It is an impressive demonstration of what one can do,” Lisdat says.

Now it seems the problem isn’t limited to Europe and North America, where the alarm was first sounded. It’s everywhere.  In 2013 the EU temporarily banned neonicotinoid s on crops that attract bees, such as oilseed rape. In November, the European Food Safety Authority will decide if the evidence warrants a total ban . France has already announced one . A sweet selection Blaise Mulhauser, Botanical Garden Neuchâtel (Switzerland) Advertisement  Starting in 2012, a team led by Alex Aebi of the University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, asked travelling colleagues, friends and relatives to bring back honey when they went abroad. In three years they amassed 198 samples from every continent except Antarctica, and tested them for neonicotinoids.  They found that three-quarters of the samples contained at least one of the five neonicotinoid pesticides. Of those, nearly half contained between two and five different neonicotinoids.  Most worryingly, in 48 per cent of the contaminated samples, the neonicotinoids were at levels that exceeded the minimum dose known to cause “marked detrimental effects” in pollinators. “The situation is indeed bad for pollinators,” says Aebi. It’s all around us  “Finding neonicotinoids in honey is perhaps not surprising,” says Christopher Connolly of the University of Dundee, UK. After all, the pesticides are widely used. “But to find neuroactive levels, in so many samples at many global sites, is shocking.”  Bees survive the winter by eating honey, so the results imply they are chronically exposed to neonicotinoids. “Recent scientific evidence showed an increased sensitivity to neonicotinoids after frequent or long-term exposure,” says Aebi.  The fact that the honey contained cocktails of neonicotinoids may also be a problem. They all act on different receptor proteins in the nervous systems of the insects. Some chemicals can boost each others’ toxic effects over time, says Connolly. However, there is only indirect evidence of this happening with the neonicotinoids so far.  Frustratingly, we have the data to figure out how real-world levels of the pesticides affect bees , but not in a useful form. Farmers in Europe and North America record their use of neonicotinoids, says Connolly, but this data needs to be gathered into geographical databases. Such databases could reveal local correlations between pesticide use and insect health. Aebi and his team are now urging governments to start collecting the data.

Photodsotiroff/Getty By Mallory Locklear  Watch the cost. People are more likely to experience stronger side effects when a treatment appears to be more expensive, according to a study of the nocebo effect .  While the placebo effect means that some people feel better when they have unknowingly been given a sham or control treatment, the nocebo works the opposite way. Researchers frequently observe nocebo effects in clinical trials, when people who receive a placebo experience negative side effects as if they had been given an actual drug.  Placebos are known to have stronger positive effects the more expensive the person receiving them believes them to be. Alexandra Tinnermann , at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, and her colleagues wondered if price might also affect the strength of the nocebo effect. Advertisement  The team created two packages for fake creams and told volunteers that they are used to treat itchy skin. One package looked like an expensive pharmaceutical brand name, while the other looked like a cheaper, generic medication.  The participants were shown one of the two creams and told that it was believed to increase a person’s sensitivity to pain as a side effect. Pain sensitivity  The team then applied creams to participants’ arms, and exposed their limbs to increasing levels of heat. Each person was asked to rank the discomfort they felt.  The participants given the more expensive-looking cream reported more pain than those given the cheaper-looking cream. Relative to a control cream that was described as having no active ingredients, the generic-looking cream raised pain on average by around 3 per cent, while the expensive-looking cream increased pain by nearly 30 per cent.  The finding confirms that the price of a treatment effects not only placebo strength, but nocebo power too.  During the pain test, the team collected fMRI images of the brain, brainstem and spinal cord. They found that activity in a particular area of the prefrontal cortex and a region called the periaqueductal gray varied depending on what cream had been given. Both these areas are part of the neural pain pathway, and have also been implicated in mediating placebo effects.  The findings may help refine how doctors nurses and pharmacists talk to patients about medications, enabling them to try to minimize the nocebo effect, says Tinnermann.

The finding raises the hope that people undergoing cancer treatment can one day avoid this distressing side effect.  Hair loss is one of the most feared side effect s of chemotherapy. One study of women with breast cancer found that around 8 per cent had considered refusing treatment to save their locks.  There are few options for people receiving treatment. Scalp-cooling caps freeze and constrict blood vessels to stop chemo drugs from flowing into hair follicles. But they are expensive, work for only 50 per cent of people , extend treatment by two hours and cause discomfort and headaches. Advertisement  Other people have experimented with using the hair loss treatment minoxidil during chemo, but a randomised controlled trial found no benefit .  Part of the problem is our limited understanding of how chemotherapy damages hair follicles, says Sung-Jan Lin at National Taiwan University.  To address this, his team looked at the role of a protein called p53. This protein is activated during chemo and helps to suppress tumour growth, but may also suppress hair growth, since hair cells rapidly divide like tumour cells. A previous study found that mice missing the p53 protein did not shed their fur during chemo. Hair-promoting protein  Studying p53, Lin and his colleagues have found that it blocks the activity of a hair-promoting protein called WNT3a. This gave them an idea: if you inject WNT3a directly into the scalp when administering chemo, will it stop hair loss?  To test this, they dosed mice with a common chemotherapy agent. Straight afterwards, they injected WNT3a-soaked beads under the surface of their skin. The microscopic beads – which were coloured blue – helped to keep the protein in a small area so the team could study its effects.  Sure enough, areas injected with the WNT3a-soaked beads were still coated with thick fur five days after chemo. In contrast, areas injected with untreated beads went bald.  When the researchers examined patches of skin under the microscope, they found the protein treatment doubled the number of stem cells in the base of the hair follicles within the first day of injection, allowing more hairs to sprout.  The team is now working on adapting the treatment for use in people. It would not be practical or safe to inject the hair-promoting protein into the scalp in bead form, says Lin. “We might need to inject it into the scalp using arrays of fine needles so that many of the hair follicles can be covered,” he says. His team is also testing compounds they have designed for activating WNT3a that could be spread over the scalp in cream or gel form.  Richard de Boer, a medical oncologist at Epworth Centre in Melbourne, Australia, says the treatment could be a big help. While scalp cooling has led to many success stories, it doesn’t work well for some types of chemotherapy, he says. “New hair-saving options that work with all chemotherapy regimens would be very welcome.” Journal reference: Cancer Research , DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0667  ",,,english,,,,,,null,2017-10-06T14:34:39.013+03:00,,,,

You may not think you are, and compared with, say, a chimpanzee , you appear distinctly bald. But in fact your entire body (with the exception of the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet) is covered in hair. All told you have about 5 million follicles, about the same as chimps and other primates.  But the similarities stop there. Human hair is decidedly strange . Most of our body hair is so wispy and short as to be almost invisible, though in some places it is coarse and curly. Our head hair is almost uniquely long and flamboyant. We are pretty much the only animal to have hair that grows continuously for many years, and also to suffer the indignity of going bald. No wonder our relationship with our hair is a tangled one. A duet of hairs  Human hair comes in two basic types: terminal hair, which grows on the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes, and vellus hair, which is found everywhere else. Beyond that, the main difference between hair types is how long they grow for before the follicle runs out of steam. This is what determines their length and thickness. Advertisement  Hair follicles go through cycles of growth and dormancy . During the growth phase the hair grows continuously at about 0.4 millimetres per day, getting longer and thicker in the process. But at some point the hair-producing cells die off and growth stops. The hair falls out and the follicle goes dormant for around six months before sprouting new hair-producing cells and entering a new growth phase.  The length of the growth phase is controlled by hormones . Leg hairs grow for about two months, which is why they are short and fine. Armpit hairs make it to six months, but head hairs grow non-stop for six years or more. That means head hair can theoretically grow to almost a metre in length.  Ideas abound as to why evolution has endowed us with such a unique combination of hair types. The leading one is that when our bipedal ancestors moved out of the forests and onto the searing heat of the savannah, they needed to keep their bodies cool while also sheltering their big brains from the sun. Body hair receded, removing an unnecessary insulating layer and also allowing the skin to be cooled by sweating. Hair loss was also presumably aided by technological innovations such as clothes, fire and cave-dwelling, which lessened the importance of fur for keeping warm at night. Head hair, meanwhile, became thicker and more luxuriant, protecting our ancestors’ brains from the midday sun, and also retaining heat in the cold.  Genetic evidence suggests that we became furless around 1.7 million years ago. Around this time our ancestor Homo erectus was living on the baking savannah, which supports the thermoregulation hypothesis. Look! No parasites  But it is not the only possibility. We may also have lost body hair to improve our ability to identify others and to make communication easier, or to resist disease, since fur is a prime habitat for parasites. There’s also sexual selection, which was Charles Darwin ‘s preferred explanation. For whatever reason, the least hairy of our ancestors were considered the most attractive and so produced more offspring. Hair-free skin may have been a billboard to advertise good health and hence attract mates – a sexual come-on saying, “Look how unblemished and parasite-free I am.”  Sexual selection could also explain our head hair. Most people find a strong, healthy head of hair attractive. Indeed, precisely because our head hair needs so much care, it makes a perfect hoarding upon which to advertise social and sexual status. Grooming is time-consuming, and so having well-groomed hair shows you are resourceful and have good social contacts. If this is correct, then the main function of head hair is to be cut and styled for maximum impact. This might explain why lank, unkempt locks are the mark of the social pariah. Prehistoric styling  Some of the most ancient figurines do have coiffed hair. The oldest known three-dimensional representation of a human, the 25,000-year-old ivory Venus of Brassempouy, has elegant shoulder-length hair. And hair products are nothing new either. The 2300-year-old Clonycavan Man, discovered in a bog in County Meath, Ireland, was wearing hair gel made of plant oils and pine resin.  Hair may also have been used to signal group identity. Throughout the ages and across cultures, we have used hairstyles as a mark of membership: think Roundheads, Rastafarians and rockabillies.  Enough about the hair on your head. Pubic hair is possibly even more unusual. Most primates have finer hair around their genitals than on the rest of their body, but adult humans are the exact opposite.  There’s no accepted explanation. One possibility is that since thicker hair coincides with regions where we have apocrine (scent) glands, it may serve to concentrate or waft odours that signal sexual maturity. Pubic hair may also protect the genitals during sex and at other times – reducing chafing while walking, for example – and also helps keep our most sensitive regions warm and free of draughts.  Whatever it evolved for, many people now subject the hair in their pubic regions to as much grooming as the hair on their heads, while ruthlessly removing it from the rest of their bodies. Hairless we ain’t – but not for lack of trying. Baldylocks  Pity the human male: along with the stump-tailed macaque, he is the only primate to routinely suffer the indignity of a receding hairline.  By age 30, a quarter of men have started to go bald, and by 45, half have. Male pattern baldness has a predictable trajectory: hair begins to disappear on the temples, then on the top of the head, before staging a general retreat that leaves the entire pate hairless.  Except that it doesn’t. Baldness is not about having no hair; it is about having the wrong sort of hair. Bald heads have just as many follicles as any other – about 100,000 – but the follicles have ceased to function properly and only produce colourless and wispy hairs.

An increasing number of people visit high-altitude sites nowadays, for work, sport, religious pilgrimages and military tasks. But even the fittest among us suffer in thin air: the lower oxygen content at altitude can lead to cognitive effects, including memory loss and attention difficulties.  There is little you can do to prevent these symptoms other than acclimatise – but this takes time and doesn’t always work. A drug called oxiracetam might be the answer. Advertisement Up and down  ShengLi Hu at the Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China, and her colleagues took men from the military up to 4000 metres above sea level.  All of the men lived in towns around 1800 metres above sea level. During the study, they spent eight days at this altitude, before climbing for three days to reach 4000 metres, where they stayed for up to a month.  Twenty participants took 800mg of oxiracetam three times per day for the first 15 days of the study, while another 20 men received no intervention. The men performed tests of attention and memory at the start and end of the study and 20 days in, by which time they had been at 4000 metres for nine days.  While all participants experienced a drop in cognitive ability at 4000 metres, those who took oxiracetam showed a much smaller decline than the control group.  Using a technique that measures the brain’s response to sounds, the team found that those who took the drug also showed less of a decline in the speed at which they could process sensory information. Going with the flow  Blood flow measurements indicated that at high altitudes, certain parts of the cerebral circulatory system contracted and dilated in a way that promoted blood flow to the brain stem. This isn’t surprising, since the brain stem plays a critical role in the maintenance of basic vital signs.  The team also found that the brain stem received blood at the expense of brain areas responsible for more advanced cognitive functions. But in people who took oxiracetam, more arteries dilated, so blood flow throughout the brain was increased. This may be how the drug seems to lessen cognitive problems associated with low oxygen. It is yet to be seen whether diverting the blood in this way could have any negative effects in the long run.  “The results are striking and imply that oxiracetam may be beneficial for helping to mitigate cognitive deficits caused by altitude,” says Timothy Hales at the University of Dundee, UK.  Despite a wealth of people admitting to taking numerous kinds of smart drugs to improve their memory or focus , there is little research on oxiracetam in healthy people. In a single study in older adults with dementia , the drug appeared to help improve performance in some memory-associated tasks.  Oxiracetam is not licensed for medical use in the UK, but the drug is known to be a mild stimulant, says Hales. “Coca leaves have been used by native Andeans for centuries to overcome altitude sickness and this is attributed to their modest cocaine content. So perhaps it is not surprising that benefit can be derived from another, albeit mild, stimulant.” Journal reference: Brain and Behaviour , DOI: 10.1002/brb3.762  More on these topics:",,,english,,,,,,null,2017-10-06T18:58:21.002+03:00,,,,

Though today it retains only a few tenuous wisps of atmosphere, new calculations show that massive volcanic eruptions released enough hot gas to create one that took 70 million years to leak away.  Astronomers had thought the moon was dry as a bone, yet we recently learned that the magma ocean covering the newborn moon 4.5 billion years ago released hot vapours of sodium and silica that formed a short-lived atmosphere . Now it seems a second lunar atmosphere developed 3.5 billion years ago as a result of eruptions flooding a large crater to form Mare Imbrium, a lava plain on the near side of the moon.  Starting nearly a decade ago, studies using sensitive new instruments revealed volatile material embedded in lunar volcanic glass collected by Apollo astronauts . The glass came from the dark lunar basins and hinted that the large volcanic eruptions that formed them between 3.8 and 3.1 billion years ago also emitted vast amounts of gas. Advertisement Dune on the moon  Now Debra Needham and David Kring at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, have calculated these emissions based on the estimated volumes of the lava flows. The largest emission was the roughly 10 trillion tonnes of gas that erupted along with the 5.3 million cubic kilometres of lava that filled the Imbrium basin. That would have raised lunar air pressure to about 1 per cent that of modern Earth, or 1.5 times the density of today’s Martian atmosphere.  “If you had any temperature gradient on the lunar surface, there would have been wind,” Needham says. With dust on the surface and enough wind to transport it, she adds, it could have been like “ Dune on the moon”. But within 70 million years, all the atmospheric gas escaped or froze out in the polar regions, and because it all happened so long ago, no evidence of these winds would remain.  James Day at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California says this atmosphere formation process could account for the distribution of water and other volatiles on the surface of the moon and their loss from its interior. It could also help us understand how planetary atmospheres form, he says.

Any disturbance that leads to the mothers separating from the pups is “bad news” for the baby seals.  Goodman with Sue Wilson and colleagues gathered data from observers who travelled on 39 icebreaker trips from 2006 to 2013 in the northern Caspian Sea. This sea is a major oil and gas drilling site. Advertisement  It is also the only home of the Caspian seals , which are found nowhere else. Caspian seal mothers give birth late in January on the open ice, and suckle their pups for about five weeks. The pups are born with white coats similar to ringed seals, and are vulnerable while still dependent on their mothers for nutrition. The mothers often choose thick, solid ice, with features like ice folds to protect the pups from wind.  Goodman identified 184 occasions on which icebreakers came within 10 metres of a mother and pup. The mother typically fled and tried to take her pup with her, but sometimes left it behind. In one case, a mother temporarily abandoned a newborn pup. Because the icebreakers were moving, it was not always possible to tell what eventually happened. However, in at least two cases mother and pup ended up a long way apart, and may have lost each other.  If the pups get knocked into the water by icebreakers or the waves they create, they can get hypothermic, says Goodman. Their coats aren’t yet heavy enough to withstand the cold water. “That can be very costly in terms of energy, or in the worst case it can lead to the death of the pup,” he says. Save the baby seals  Goodman says the best way to avoid such problems is to send fewer icebreakers through seal habitats during breeding season. When such transits are unavoidable, ships might avoid seal hotspots. Finally, ships could carry trained observers to advise the crew on how to avoid seals.  Unfortunately, icebreakers don’t always have a lot of flexibility in their movement, says Erin Moreland at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The problem is compounded by low visibility at night.  Instead, Moreland says drones might offer more advance warning of what’s ahead. She has also seen ships equipped with thermal imaging.  It’s unclear how significant the effects of icebreakers are for Caspian seal populations, Goodman says. He has since briefed the Kazakh company that operates the icebreakers. “They responded well to the advice that was given to them.”  Caspian seals are considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature – mainly because they get caught up in sturgeon nets from illegal fishing operations, which have proliferated since the collapse of the Soviet Union. “If you ask me what to do to protect Caspian seals, it would be to sort out the by-catch problem first and foremost,” says Goodman.  The study implies that related species, like ring seals in the Arctic, could also be affected by icebreakers, says Dan Costa at the University of California, Santa Cruz. But the risk is likely to be lower for these species. “The difference in the Arctic is that the species are just much more numerous,” he says.  However, shipping traffic in the Arctic is increasing and viable habitat for Arctic seals will shrink due to issues like climate change. That means the icebreakers might ultimately pose a problem for those seals too, says Costa.

The discovery that our characters change is unnerving, but embrace it and it can be empowering Daniel Stolle By Emma Young  AS A child, Wendy Johnson was extremely shy. “One of my report cards said: ‘Wendy is so shy, it’s painful to watch!” She’s not like that now. “I am definitely a person who learned to overcome overt shyness,” says Johnson, a psychologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK. She says shyness is an indicator of a low level of extroversion, a key measure of personality, which she studies. So does this mean Johnson has changed her personality? Undoubtedly, she says.  That answer might surprise you. Most of us consider our personality to be an integral and unchanging part of who we are – perhaps the essence of that thing we call the self. In 1887, psychologist William James went so far as to argue that it becomes “set like plaster” by the age of 30. His idea stuck. Psychologists have long debated how to measure personality, settling eventually on the “big five” traits (see “ What are you like? “). But at least they were able to agree on a definition: personality refers to an individual’s thought patterns and behaviours, which tend to persist over time. Now mounting evidence is undermining that notion. Personality is far more mutable than we thought. That may be a little unsettling. But it’s also good news for the almost 90 per cent of us who wish our personalities were at least a little different .  There’s no doubt that personality is partly genetic. What’s less certain is how much is down to our genes and how much to nurture .

A recent closed-door colloquium held at a top British university brought together two dozen leading AI researchers and a group of illustrious humanities scholars to address philosophical questions raised by AI.  In the event, however, the two contingents struggled to find common ground. The engineers described their work in precise, dense terms, mostly skipping over its implications. The scholars, too, critiqued the descriptions rather than tackling the implications; some seemed affronted by the very idea of thinking machines. Advertisement  That’s a pity, because we really need fresh thinking on AI. Public discussion is dominated by scary stories about the elimination of human workers – or of humans, full stop. Meanwhile, machine learning applications are quietly becoming integral to our daily lives, with little consideration of the consequences (see “ How scaremongering steps us asking the right questions about AI “).  Those consequences are myriad, poorly understood, and evolving rapidly. AIs are now involved in many decisions that significantly affect our lives. But there is also growing evidence that they aren’t necessarily ready to shoulder all the responsibilities they are being given.  Machine learning alone may be fine when it comes to optimising, say, your power usage. But in less clear-cut tasks, such as healthcare, the combination of human and machine can be more effective. Then there’s the problem of “algorithmic bias” in AI decision-making (see “ Biased policing is made worse by errors in pre-crime algorithms “).  Artificial intelligence really has made great strides in recent years, so much so that initial awe at these machines’ uncanny abilities is giving way to hucksterism. But for all their smarts, the machines can’t tell us how we could best deploy them. For that, we need people willing to engage in a genuine meeting of minds.

This year they included the physics prize awarded to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne for the development of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), and the subsequent direct detection of gravitational waves.  Sure, it is one of the great successes of modern science, but remember also that it is the culmination of a century of theory, experimentation and observation.
