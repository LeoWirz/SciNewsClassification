Visualisation by Andrey Kravtsov By Leah Crane \nThe missing links between galaxies have finally been found. This is the first detection of the roughly half of the normal matter in our universe \u2013 protons, neutrons and electrons \u2013 unaccounted for by previous observations of stars, galaxies and other bright objects in space. \nYou have probably heard about the hunt for dark matter , a mysterious substance thought to permeate the universe, the effects of which we can see through its gravitational pull. But our models of the universe also say there should be about twice as much ordinary matter out there, compared with what we have observed so far. \nTwo separate teams found the missing matter \u2013 made of particles called baryons rather than dark matter \u2013 linking galaxies together through filaments of hot, diffuse gas . Advertisement \n\u201cThe missing baryon problem is solved,\u201d says Hideki Tanimura at the Institute of Space Astrophysics in Orsay, France, leader of one of the groups. The other team was led by Anna de Graaff at the University of Edinburgh, UK. Read more: Strangely familiar \u2013 Is dark matter normal stuff in disguise? \nBecause the gas is so tenuous and not quite hot enough for X-ray telescopes to pick up, nobody had been able to see it before. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no sweet spot \u2013 no sweet instrument that we\u2019ve invented yet that can directly observe this gas,\u201d says Richard Ellis at University College London. \u201cIt\u2019s been purely speculation until now.\u201d \nSo the two groups had to find another way to definitively show that these threads of gas are really there. \nBoth teams took advantage of a phenomenon called the Sunyaev-Zel\u2019dovich effect that occurs when light left over from the big bang passes through hot gas. As the light travels, some of it scatters off the electrons in the gas, leaving a dim patch in the cosmic microwave background \u2013 our snapshot of the remnants from the birth of the cosmos. Stack \u2018em up \nIn 2015, the Planck satellite created a map of this effect throughout the observable universe. Because the tendrils of gas between galaxies are so diffuse, the dim blotches they cause are far too slight to be seen directly on Planck\u2019s map. \nBoth teams selected pairs of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that were expected to be connected by a strand of baryons. They stacked the Planck signals for the areas between the galaxies, making the individually faint strands detectable en masse. \nTanimura\u2019s team stacked data on 260,000 pairs of galaxies , and de Graaff\u2019s group used over a million pairs. Both teams found definitive evidence of gas filaments between the galaxies. Tanimura\u2019s group found they were almost three times denser than the mean for normal matter in the universe, and de Graaf\u2019s group found they were six times denser \u2013 confirmation that the gas in these areas is dense enough to form filaments. \n\u201cWe expect some differences because we are looking at filaments at different distances,\u201d says Tanimura. \u201cIf this factor is included, our findings are very consistent with the other group.\u201d Read more: Missing matter \u2013 Where did half the universe go? \nFinally finding the extra baryons that have been predicted by decades of simulations validates some of our assumptions about the universe. \n\u201cEverybody sort of knows that it has to be there, but this is the first time that somebody \u2013 two different groups, no less \u2013 has come up with a definitive detection,\u201d says Ralph Kraft at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. \n\u201cThis goes a long way toward showing that many of our ideas of how galaxies form and how structures form over the history of the universe are pretty much correct,\u201d he says.

A high-tech paint that actually cools when exposed to sunlight can provide a better way to chill buildings \u2013 and perhaps even solve the long-standing problem of cooling things in space. \nIn hot weather, electricity consumption soars as people turn on the air conditioning, pushing the grid to its limits and raising energy bills. Now Yaron Shenhav and his colleagues from SolCold, a firm based in Herzliya, Israel, have come up with an alternative that doesn\u2019t require electricity. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting a layer of ice on your rooftop which is thicker when there is more sun,\u201d he says. \nThe technology is based on the counterintuitive principle of laser cooling, in which hitting specially designed materials with a laser can cool them by up to 150\u00b0C. It works because molecules in these materials absorb photons whose light is of one frequency while spontaneously re-emitting higher-frequency photons, which also carry more energy. Since energy is lost, the temperature of the material is reduced in the process. Advertisement \nMounting lasers on your roof wouldn\u2019t be very practical, though, so Shenhav wanted to see if he could tweak the technique to make it work with sunlight instead. \u201cHeat from a building could be absorbed and re-emitted as light,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as the sun is shining on it, it would be continuously cooled.\u201d \nThe problem is that the sun\u2019s spectrum is much broader than that of laser light \u2013 a focused beam with a narrow range of frequencies. So the team had to create a material that could do the same trick using several frequencies of scattered light. They came up with a paint made up of two layers: an outer layer that filters out some of the sun\u2019s rays and an inner one that does the heat-to-light conversion, cooling itself below the ambient temperature. \nSo far, the material has been successfully tested in the lab, where the researchers have found that the effect is more pronounced on metal roofs than on concrete, and works best over rooms with low ceilings. Simulations show that a room on the top floor will feel up to 10\u00b0C cooler than with the paint applied if applied to a roof of a house than without the coating . The team will conduct pilot tests on buildings within two years. \nPeople already use white cooling paints to scatter and reduce the amount of heat buildings absorb. However, they can\u2019t actively reduce the temperature in the building, whereas SolCold\u2019s paint can, says Eran Zahavy at the Israel Institute of Biological Research, who was not involved in the research. Cut the air conditioning \nThe new paint isn\u2019t cheap, costing about $300 to coat 100 square metres. Shenhav and his team think the early adopters will be large commercial buildings like shopping malls and stadiums. There, the coating could lower energy consumption by up to 60 per cent, massively reducing bills and carbon emissions. \nIt could have other knock-on environmental benefits as well. The continuous use of air conditioning in already hot areas like Phoenix, Arizona , creates urban heat islands which have been linked to steadily rising temperatures in such cities. With the new paint, \u201cbuildings would be able to install much smaller air-conditioning units,\u201d says Shenav. \nThe paint\u2019s use isn\u2019t limited to this planet: it could solve the significant challenge of how to cool objects in space. That might seem counterintuitive given the frigid temperatures there, but the problem is that there is no air to carry heat away from an object. Currently, the ISS uses reflective fabric to ward off radiation from the sun, and internal heat exchangers to get rid of excess heat produced by equipment. \u201cWith our technology, heat is transferred through light,\u201d says Shenhav. \u201cSpace applications are a big market for us.\u201d \nThe team will be presenting their work later this month at the Hello Tomorrow technology summit in Paris. \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yaron shenhav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eran zahavy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandrine ceurstemont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shenav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shenhav", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "israel institute of biological research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solcold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iss", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "herzliya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phoenix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T15:26:46.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fce67cd69c628a8ccc66b8f833855c84abbb246", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLat3_cHReQM6jF7h38VfxWOAQDEnf5AWgqqJZbPPF8RRzP..q2HmZHRLqW8w.7i91I8uZV_PoLLCUm8hfRyNd5WBgKfgqGuwOMQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/climate-change", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Exploding stars could have kick-started our ancestors\u2019 evolution", "title_full": "Exploding stars could have kick-started our ancestors\u2019 evolution", "published": "2017-10-09T16:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09135717/gettyimages-158411811.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 169, "comments": 0, "shares": 169}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5fce67cd69c628a8ccc66b8f833855c84abbb246", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLat3_cHReQM6jF7h38VfxWOAQDEnf5AWgqqJZbPPF8RRzP..q2HmZHRLqW8w.7i91I8uZV_PoLLCUm8hfRyNd5WBgKfgqGuwOMQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-09T16:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Exploding stars could have kick-started our ancestors\u2019 evolution", "text": "Exploding stars could have kick-started our ancestors\u2019 evolution Great news for grasses Frans Lanting/Mint Images/Getty By Colin Barras \nWas the rise of humankind written in the stars? A nearby star exploding 8 million years ago might have triggered more frequent lightning on Earth. Wildfires ignited by that lightning could help explain the rise of east African savannahs \u2013 which many researchers think provided a vital backdrop for the early evolution of hominins. \nThe rise of African savannahs, beginning about 8 million years ago, has long been a mystery to biologists. They are dominated by plants called C4 grasses \u2013 but those grasses appeared 20 million years ago, long before they rose to dominance. Some botanists now wonder whether the trigger was a spate of wildfires 8 million years ago . Grasses bounce back quickly after a wildfire while trees are slower to recover, so frequent wildfires would have favoured the expansion of savannahs . \nNow researchers led by Brian Thomas at Washburn University in Kansas, Georg Feulner at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and Adrian Melott at the University of Kansas have provided a possible explanation for the surge in wildfires 8 million years ago. \nDeep-sea sediments of that age contain a lot of iron-60, which is produced in massive stars. Its presence strongly suggests there was at least one nearby supernova at the time . \nThe team says a pulse of high-energy cosmic rays from the supernova must have swept across Earth. They calculated that some of the cosmic rays would have been energetic enough to reach the lower atmosphere and ionise particles in the air \u2013 a process that some physicists have linked to lightning formation . \nThe To continue reading this premium article, subscribe for unlimited access.

The World Anti-Doping Agency has extended its 2003 ban on \u201cgene doping\u201d to include all forms of gene editing \u2013 but it is not clear the agency has the means to enforce this ban. \nWADA already bans the use of genetically modified cells and gene therapy if they have \u201cthe potential to enhance sport performance\u201d. From 2018 , the list will also include \u201cgene editing agents designed to alter genome sequences and/or the transcriptional or epigenetic regulation of gene expression\u201d. \nGene editing involves tweaking existing genes, rather than adding whole new ones to a person\u2019s body. The field is advancing incredibly fast thanks to the development in 2012 of an easy editing method called CRISPR. The first human trials of the method are already underway . Advertisement \nWhether people who have medical treatment involving such methods will be able to later compete in sports depends on the nature of the treatment, says WADA spokesperson Maggie Durand. \n\u201cGenerally, performance enhancement implies enhancement beyond a return to normal, although you may appreciate that this is not always easy to prove definitively,\u201d she says. \nIn cases where a treatment is specifically banned by WADA, athletes will be able to apply for an exemption when gene editing is used for therapeutic use. Detection problem \nBut how will WADA be able to detect people who have tried using gene editing to get a competitive advantage? \nThe agency did not answer New Scientist \u2019s question about whether it has the technical capacity to detect any cheats who resort to gene editing. \nIt certainly won\u2019t be easy. The agency first started developing ways to detect gene doping more than a decade ago, but only began testing for one kind of gene therapy last year. \nBlood samples from athletes who competed in the 2016 Rio Olympics are now being tested for added copies of a gene coding for EPO, a hormone that boost red blood cell levels . No positive results have yet been announced. \nGene editing should be even harder to detect than conventional gene therapies like this. Gene editing should make it possible to make tiny alterations to DNA in existing genes, or to just temporarily boost or switch off the activity of particular genes. What\u2019s more, these tweaks can be restricted to specific tissues such as muscle, meaning the changes may not show up in blood tests. \nIn theory, the \u201cbiological passports\u201d introduced by WADA in 2009 should reveal any unexpected changes in an athlete\u2019s body, even if gene doping itself cannot be detected.

New observations show parts of the solar corona at scalding temperatures with no visible heat sources \u2013 suggesting that lots of small explosions may be hotting things up. \nThe state of the corona has been a source of mystery since 1869, when astronomers detected an unknown material during a solar eclipse. When the material was later identified as iron that reached more than a million degrees centigrade, it posed a problem: the sun\u2019s surface can only reach 5500\u00b0C, so how could the plasma above be so much hotter ? \nThe excess heat may come from nanoflares \u2013 small, staccato eruptions of plasma released by kinks in the sun\u2019s magnetic field, says Lindsay Glesener at the University of Minnesota in Twin Cities and her colleagues, including team leader Shin-nosuke Ishikawa at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in Kanagawa. Advertisement \nIndividually, nanoflares would be beyond the vision of current technology, but Glesener\u2019s team may have detected them in aggregate. \n\u201cMaybe you can see the total effects of a [small] flare and all of its friends added together,\u201d says Glesener . \nThe team\u2019s data comes from FOXSI-2, the second flight of a rocket called the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager. The craft launched from New Mexico on 11 December 2014, and spent just 6.5 minutes staring at different regions of the sun before returning to Earth. During the mission, the team made decisions on where to point its instruments in real time. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hectic,\u201d Glesener says. \nOver an active region of the sun with no obvious flares , the team saw 15 high-energy X-ray photons that were likely produced by material at 10 million degrees. If the corona had a uniform, steady heat source \u2013 as alternative theories suggest, with magnetic waves carrying the heat up from below \u2013 plasma would not get that warm. \n\u201cI was really excited to see this,\u201d says Amy Winebarger at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \nBoth Winebarger and Glesener count this as strong evidence that nanoflares exist, but think that more study is needed to close the case on coronal heating. \u201cThe next step is we have to confront the models with this,\u201d Winebarger says. \nThe next FOXSI flight in August 2018 may also help by finding more hot pockets of coronal plasma, as could the existing NuSTAR X-ray satellite, Glesener says. \nJournal Reference: Nature Astronomy , DOI: 10.1038/s41550-017-0269-z \nRead more: Sun \u2018smoke rings\u2019 give clue to solar wind mystery \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amy winebarger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsay glesener", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shin-nosuke ishikawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juerg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glesener", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winebarger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "japan aerospace exploration agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall space flight center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntsville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kanagawa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T19:22:03.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45058939bf4cdb534a3d8437a3840394d525d3fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLavWohkVHGmpGeMYW53Osd2wUNzoepEqL5wDqlxWhtUtq6dJtnKnKoIrNlBAxDy7uVOhx3qn3rX094Ly2cztRXIvyBBq89m5N4g--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/news", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Kuwait\u2019s plans for mandatory DNA database have been cancelled", "title_full": "Kuwait\u2019s plans for mandatory DNA database have been cancelled", "published": "2017-10-09T19:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09161936/gettyimages-464366916.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 100, "comments": 0, "shares": 100}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 25}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45058939bf4cdb534a3d8437a3840394d525d3fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLavWohkVHGmpGeMYW53Osd2wUNzoepEqL5wDqlxWhtUtq6dJtnKnKoIrNlBAxDy7uVOhx3qn3rX094Ly2cztRXIvyBBq89m5N4g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-09T19:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kuwait\u2019s plans for mandatory DNA database have been cancelled", "text": "Kuwait\u2019s plans for mandatory DNA database have been cancelled Personal liberty at stake YASSER AL-ZAYYAT/AFP/Getty Images By Andy Coghlan \nKuwait has revoked the world\u2019s first law requiring all citizens and visitors to submit samples of their DNA. \nPassed in 2015, the law was challenged last year by lawyers in Kuwait.

This convergence suggests that it may someday be possible to predict how many species live in a particular habitat, and even to identify the holes left by missing species. \nFor more than half a century, ecologists have tended to describe ecological roles, or \u201cniches\u201d, as though they were properties of individual species. For example, chameleons are camouflaged, tree-dwelling lizards that ambush insects, while horned lizards are ground-dwelling desert creatures that eat ants and bear protective spines. The diversity can seem overwhelming. \nBut Eric Pianka , an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Texas in Austin, has long wondered whether there might only be a certain, limited set of niches. Advertisement \nTo test the idea, Pianka and his colleague Laurie Vitt at the University of Oklahoma decided to pool their decades of experience studying lizards in the field. \u201cOur entire life, basically, has been going out and collecting data on lizards,\u201d says Vitt. \u201cSo we have a huge data set.\u201d \nThe pair looked at 134 species on four continents. For each one, they examined more than 50 features of their niches, such as habitat type, hunting style, reproductive output and defences against predators. Then, with colleagues, they crunched the numbers. \nOver and over, they saw pairs of unrelated lizards converge on similar niches. Out of the 134 species, 100 belonged to a convergent pair, far more than could have happened by chance. For example, African chameleons have ecological equivalents in the Americas called bush anoles , and Australia\u2019s thorny devil fills almost precisely the same niche as North America\u2019s horned lizards. \nIf lizards could evolve into an unlimited number of niches, this convergence would be unlikely. Instead, their result suggests that lizards are constrained to live particular lifestyles. For instance, there are no marine lizards or lizards that behave like elephants. \u201cThere\u2019s only a certain number of ways to be a lizard,\u201d says Pianka. Laws of nature \n\u201cThis is beautiful,\u201d says evolutionary biologist George McGhee at Rutgers University in New Jersey. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing the number of species that have converged into ecological roles.\u201d \nEcologists could apply the same approach to other groups, like birds or rodents. However, each group is likely to have its own unique set of niche features \u2013 for example, many birds make long migrations, and some rodents hibernate \u2013 which would complicate the analysis, says Pianka. \nThe limited number of niches implies that ecologists may someday be able to construct a \u201ctable of niches\u201d, somewhat analogous to chemistry\u2019s periodic table of elements. \u201cIf we constructed this table, and we thought it was fairly complete, then we could go into places and look at the structure of the habitat, the temperatures and so on, and say \u2018this place ought to be able to support 10 species of lizards\u2019,\u201d says Vitt. Ecologists could then predict far more about the natural world than they can today. \nMoreover, such a table would highlight \u201cempty\u201d niches where species ought to occur but do not. These gaps could point to niches that were once filled by a species that has died out, but so recently that evolution has not yet refilled the niche, says Vitt. \nHowever, the findings do not necessarily mean that extinct species can be easily replaced by their ecological equivalents, says Vitt. Such \u201cplug and play\u201d replacements have been attempted on Indian Ocean islands, where giant tortoises wiped out by human activity have been substituted by tortoises from other islands . The problem is, even if the new species fills the same niche, it may respond differently to competitors, predators and prey \u2013 leading to unpredictable changes in the ecosystem.

Nudging relies on subtle psychological ploys to guide consumers to make choices that are more beneficial for themselves or for society. Advertisement \nOne example of nudging is redrafting the default choice for organ donation , so that people have to consciously opt out of donating rather than taking the trouble to opt in. \nAnother is making pension contributions the default option for employees, subtly encouraging them to save for the future rather than squander their salaries on instant gratification. \nThe potential for nudging has proved so great that some governments, including those of the UK and the USA, have set up \u201cNudge Units\u201d to help push pro-environment, pro-saving and pro-health agendas. \nThaler\u2019s other major contribution was his studies of the limits to people\u2019s rationality. \n\u201cBy exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences and lack of self-control, [Thaler] has shown how these human traits systematically affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes,\u201d says the Royal Swedish Academy . \nAs an example of limited rationality, the academy cites the case of a taxi driver who stops working daily once a pre-set target for income is reached. According to Thaler, the driver could earn considerably more by working beyond the target on days when the target is met early, as there is more custom available, and stopping work early if demand is slack, even if the target isn\u2019t met. \nThaler\u2019s work also showed that people often take fairness into account when making economic decisions, even if it means paying more or suffering a personal cost for punishing others perceived as acting unfairly. For instance, consumers may decide against buying umbrellas even when it\u2019s raining hard if they can see that umbrella sellers have raised the price during rainy spells. \nThaler also coined the \u201cendowment effect\u201d, a phenomenon whereby people tend to value things they already own , or created, more highly than matching objects on open sale. \nAnd to help resolve the internal tension in everyone between short-term gratification and long-term planning, Thaler theorised that we all have a \u201cplanning\u201d self, and a \u201cdoing\u201d self, calling it the planner-doer phenomenon. Thaler realised, for example, that people would be more willing to contribute to occupational pensions if employees commit to allocating a portion of future salary increases to the pot, rather than from their existing salaries, another example of the \u201cnudge\u201d phenomenon.

Anton Petrus/Getty By Lakshmi Supriya \nAncient humans may have trekked out of Africa to escape arid climes. This is the result suggested by a record of climate in East Africa spanning the past 200,000 years. \n\u201cIt raises the possibility that drought, rather than rainy conditions, prompted early humans to migrate,\u201d says lead author Jessica Tierney at the University of Arizona. \nModern humans are widely agreed to have evolved in Africa and are thought to have migrated out 65,000 to 55,000 years ago. They may have left via East Africa and headed to Arabia, although this isn\u2019t settled. Advertisement \nPrevious studies showed that many parts of Africa, like the Sahara, have had many wet and dry periods. A marine core, collected from the Gulf of Aden off Africa\u2019s east coast in 1965, has sediments dating to 200,000 years ago. Analysing this allowed Tierney and her colleagues to construct an extended timeline of climate shifts in north-east Africa. \nThey focused on a chemical called alkenone that is made by marine algae, whose composition changes as the temperature of the sea surface alters. In this way, they determined temperatures every 1600 years, going back 200,000 years. \nThe team also created a rainfall record by analysing the wax of leaves blown out to sea and buried in the sediment. Plants make subtly different leaf wax depending on rainfall. Changing climes \nBetween 130,000 and 80,000 years ago, the team found that north-east Africa was warm and wet, in line with previous evidence . At this time, humans were expanding throughout Africa, leading some to suggest that the green Sahara made it easier for people to move out into Europe and Asia. \nBut between 75,000 and 55,000 years ago, the climate turned dry and cold \u2013 and genetic studies suggest this is when the major out-of-Africa migration happened . So instead of a comfortable climate making it easy to leave Africa, Tierney says, maybe the difficult climate made the move necessary. \nThe study successfully ties together all the disparate lines of evidence about past Saharan climates, says Nicholas Drake of King\u2019s College London. \nHowever, the interpretation is less clear because the date of the out-of-Africa migration is highly contentious. Two recent studies found evidence that modern humans were in Sumatra at least 63,000 years ago and in Australia by 65,000 years ago , which implies an earlier exit. Other studies hint at multiple waves of dispersa l dating back 130,000 years. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can really say that dispersal coincided with North Africa becoming drier and colder,\u201d says archaeologist Huw Groucutt at the University of Oxford.

This is the first time astronomers have caught one in the act and it could help us better understand odd cosmic objects known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). \nAGN occur when an enormous black hole \u2013 often with the mass of a billion suns \u2013 finds itself in the centre of a galaxy. As large clouds of gas and dust fall into the black hole, they spin around its edge and experience extreme forces and friction. Heated to millions of degrees, the material can shine brighter than all the other stars in the galaxy combined. But once the gas and dust get used up, the black hole goes dark. \nInactive AGNs sometimes show evidence of past meals \u2013 clouds of material that were shot out of the galactic centre along with the intense radiation, lingering for hundreds of thousands of years until they dissipate. Advertisement \nNow Julie Comerford of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and her colleagues have spotted two separate outbursts in a galaxy called J1354+1327, located about 900 million light years away. \nThe earlier eruption resulted in a patch of bright dust south of the galactic center that has spread into a feathery cone approximately 30,000 light years long. A later explosion generated a compact dome of material located about 1300 light years north of the black hole. \n\u201cIt solidifies the way we thought AGN flickering works,\u201d says Comerford. J1354+1327 and its smaller companion galaxy may have previously collided, a long-suspected trigger for AGN activity Comerford et al \nBecause all they see are snapshots of activity, astronomers have wondered if AGN events occur in long blasts that last tens of millions of years, or if they are more rapid fire. Comerford and her team estimate that the two outbursts happened roughly 100,000 years apart, relatively fast for cosmic processes, confirming results seen in some computer models. \nThe work fits with our simulations, says Travis Fischer of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who was not part of the study. \u201cHaving an actual set of data points of what are possible reignition times is very valuable.\u201d \nJ1354+1327\u2019s double snack attack was spotted because material from the later eruption is currently pummeling into interstellar gas and dust, generating bright shockwaves. Knowing how to now find this signature, the team hopes to discover other reigniting AGN. \nJ1354+1327 also has a smaller companion galaxy located about 40,000 light years from it. The two galaxies appear to be connected by a bridge of stars, suggesting that they previously collided, a long-suspected trigger for AGN activity. The interaction could have thrown material at the central black hole, powering one or more of its feeding periods. \nSuch results have significance closer to home. Our own Milky Way possesses a central supermassive black hole and enormous clouds of gas and dust extending far above and below its plane. \nKnown as Fermi bubbles , these structures were likely created by the black hole feeding at some point in the past. When the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy crashes into us in about 4 billion years, \u201cmaybe we\u2019ll get lit up as an AGN again\u201d, says Comerford. \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "comerford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam mann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie comerford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "travis fischer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goddard space flight center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "boulder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenbelt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T21:14:54.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "463da79262dfe879dfdf6e6eb565c06646a6ae0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLasK2G5d8rA_2pL6gefEg1VKC8pl6Z6Rq0MIN_BqgWHQQJbnFTZLONNXQkmQqKh.zLH41YIgixcp0ZfEKqdwU3HaJRpMcHbUykg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Smartphone lets you see round corners by light flicker on floor", "title_full": "Smartphone lets you see round corners by light flicker on floor", "published": "2017-10-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09144256/gettyimages-172256190.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 152, "comments": 0, "shares": 152}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "463da79262dfe879dfdf6e6eb565c06646a6ae0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLasK2G5d8rA_2pL6gefEg1VKC8pl6Z6Rq0MIN_BqgWHQQJbnFTZLONNXQkmQqKh.zLH41YIgixcp0ZfEKqdwU3HaJRpMcHbUykg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Smartphone lets you see round corners by light flicker on floor", "text": "Smartphone lets you see round corners by light flicker on floor I can see you\u2026 even if you can\u2019t see me AndreasReh/Getty By Douglas Heaven \nThe walls may not have eyes \u2013 but you can turn them into cameras that let you see around corners. Armed with a smartphone and some straightforward optical analysis, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has shown that you can spot moving objects hidden from view around corners. By watching changes in the reflected light pooling on the floor at the base of a wall, they were able to trace the paths of people not visible through the open door. The technique could be used by vehicles to spot pedestrians in blind spots or let response teams see around corners in hostage situations . \n\u201cA lot of our work involves finding hidden signals you wouldn\u2019t think would be there,\u201d says team member Katie Bouman. For example, in a previous project Bouman and her colleagues turned a window into a kind of aperture on the outside world. By taking consecutive frames of the shifting light spilling through it, they were able to construct pictures of what was happening out of sight. But, counterintuitively, corners are even better than windows. \u201cThey\u2019re everywhere and allow us to see hidden things all the time,\u201d she says. \nThe trick is tracking tiny variations in the colour of light. A similar technique can let phone and web cameras detect someone\u2019s pulse by detecting fluctuations in skin tone. Bouman and her colleagues realised that variations in colour in a pool of light by a floor corner contained information about hidden objects reflecting that light. By analysing the patterns, they mapped the trajectory of the objects moving behind the wall. Advertisement Hiding in plain sight \nThey tested the system with people walking around a room with the door ajar. Using a single corner of the floor, they generated a video that showed how many people were hidden from view, and where they were walking. With two corners \u2013 such as in a doorway \u2013 the could also see where the people were in the room. The technique works with a variety of light sources \u2013 both indoors and out \u2013 and in different weather conditions, including rain. It also works on a range of surfaces, such as linoleum, carpet, tile and brick paving with weeds. The only thing that thwarts it is darkness. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty simple idea, really fast for processing,\u201d says Bouman. Since the video can be computed quickly, it could be used in cars or industrial vehicles to spot people just out of sight in a room. And because the system relies on ambient light your presence can be undetectable. The project is one of many funded by US defence technology agency DARPA , who are looking into similar techniques, says Bouman. \u201cLots of people are working on different methods to see around corners.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool work,\u201d says Fadel Adib at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, who has worked on a similar system using Wi-Fi. He is impressed that Bouban\u2019s team can analyse the light in real time using just a consumer camera. He also thinks that by refining the analysis it would be possible to extract even more information \u2013 perhaps helping to distinguish individuals wearing similar coloured clothes, for example. \u201cThis is only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he says. \nIndeed, Bouman is now applying her tricks to imaging black holes .

Until recently, we also assumed that ancient peoples welcomed the advantages of this way of life as well as the growth of state leadership, since it was key to the development of culture, crafts and civil order. \nOver the past 50 years, though, more and more cracks have appeared in this picture. We now know settled agriculture existed for several thousand years before the emergence of the city states of the Near East and Asia. In the past few years, archaeologists have been stunned to find 11,000-year-old structures such as those at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, in what is now southern Turkey. These were built by peoples who foraged, and who also developed specialised skills, both artistic and artisanal. \nThis is a surprise, and leaves researchers busily trying to get the story straight \u2013 something that really matters for a number of reasons. Traditional definitions of the state and its authority hinged on the right to raise taxes, and on its legal monopoly on coercing its people, from punishing and imprisoning them to waging formal war. \nBut as James Scott points out, roughly between 8000 BC and 4000 BC we find settled agricultural communities with developing craft skills \u2013 yet no evidence of anything much by way of state authority. \nThis also poses a key question, one which resonates in the 21st century, about whether there is a necessary link between state power and community life. \nScott is a political science researcher at Yale University who has stepped out of his academic comfort zone to grapple with the new archaeological reality. Against the Grain delivers not only a darker story, but also a broad understanding of the forces that shaped the formation of states and why they collapsed \u2013 right up to the industrial age. \nInterestingly, his conclusions find grim contemporary echoes in a new book about the San Bushmen of the Kalahari by anthropologist James Suzman, who spent 25 years with them. In Affluence without Abundance , Suzman, an African studies fellow at the University of Cambridge, documents what happened when pastoralists, encouraged by governments, enclosed the San\u2019s lands and took away their hunter-gatherer way of life. \nThe San\u2019s recent past is like a speeded-up version of Scott\u2019s tale. He teases out the elements of how states formed, especially in Mesopotamia \u2013 specifically what is now modern southern Iraq. It was here that the first small city states appeared, on the northern shore of the Gulf and on plains created and watered by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. San Bushmen are trying to cling on to their traditional way of life Jason Edwards/National Geographic Creative \nThere is some evidence for settlements among foragers in the Near East, often near wetlands, around 12,000 BC, and field agriculture from about 10,000 BC. But the earliest evidence of states dates from 4000 BC, with permanently settled towns. This is where Scott derives that figure of at least 4000 years between settlement-plus-agriculture (the two assumed prerequisites of state formation) and the first appearance of the state. \nAround 12,000 BC, the world\u2019s population stood at between two and four million; by 2000 BC, it was around 25 million. But the vast majority of people had no contact with states as late as the end of the 15th century \u2013 Europe\u2019s middle ages. These people survived on a mix of agriculture and foraging, much like the inhabitants of those early settlements on the plains of Mesopotamia before 4000 BC. \nScott describes the creation, from around 4000 BC, of what he calls \u201clate-Neolithic multispecies resettlement camps\u201d. Faced with a shortage of wild resources, these made use of domesticated animals and plants. Life in these settlements was much tougher than foraging, and the daily drudgery, chronic illness and epidemics brought on by increased reliance on domesticated species are apparent in skeletal remains and sudden collapses in population. \nAs the Danish agricultural economist Ester Boserup and some anthropologists have noted, there is little reason to imagine foragers would have adopted this way of life unless they were hungry, afraid or coerced. \nA combination of factors seems to have caused people to cluster in those Mesopotamian plains, including rising populations in areas where wild food was more abundant, a cold spell in the climate, and possibly a rise in sea level. The populations in Scott\u2019s camps developed even better craft skills and social cohesion. \nEarly state development around the world has another defining feature, a staple diet of cereals. By contrast, agricultures based on tubers or pulses have no fixed harvest period and create no stockpiles. As Scott remarks, there are no early states founded on manioc, yam or sweet potato. \nBut the annual grain harvest creates two problems: storage, which requires protection; and vulnerability to thieving supervisors or outside raiders. It also ties producers to their store in time and space \u2013 no wandering off with a bow and arrow. \nIt seems likely, says Scott, that at first there was a voluntary approach to collective labour in fields, and to grain being pooled for safekeeping and even redistribution to the needy. But this created all the technical and organisational know-how for an increasingly coercive state. Constrained to a relatively small area, people were dependent on central grain stores, and grew used to supervision of both food distribution and their labour \u2013 things that feature almost obsessively in early writing. \nBy 3000 BC, we have the first definitive evidence of city states, with kings, bureaucracies, compulsory labour, taxation and punishment for non-compliance. These early states were also very fragile, prone to epidemics, soil degradation and political collapse. \nPredictably, then, those early city states in Mesopotamia soon entered a long period of rivalry and shifting alliances. A key element was the struggle to dominate trade with hinterland peoples who had access to stone, timber and other resources not found on the alluvial plains. \nThis became a common theme among the emerging cereal states and was mirrored much later elsewhere, for example, in China\u2019s \u201cwarring states\u201d period, starting in the 5th century BC. Victors subjected conquered neighbours to tribute, bondage and forced resettlement, particularly to do unskilled work in erecting city walls and irrigation. Thousands of identical, crude, bevelled pottery bowls found around Mesopotamia suggest measured rations for gang labour. \u201cFor at least 4000 years, there were settled communities but no evidence of state power\u201d \nSlavery and severe punishment for escapees remained at the heart of subsequent regional kingdoms and empires. Each civilisation retained trade links with those in surrounding areas, the so-called barbarians. These were typically pastoralists who often kept some foraging component to their diets, and tended to be healthier and to have more personal freedoms. \nThis set up a dynamic that repeated into the last millennium, with people in the non-state periphery trading goods and slaves, and periodically raiding cereal-based cities. Tied together in this tense relationship, roaming pastoralists and urban states (Scott\u2019s \u201cdark twins\u201d of history) slowly captured or wiped out foragers and their way of life. \nThe same dark twins are in evidence in Suzman\u2019s affectionate and thoughtful book. Many of the San were compelled to work on cattle ranches in miserable and often violent conditions, while their foraging territories were fenced off by surrounding pastoralists or ranchers. Some still remember the \u201cold times\u201d, but knowledge of the wild food sources they once relied on is dwindling. Groups are resettled in remote camps with a few shops, useless to them without money. \nUnder these new conditions, the forager mindset, its distaste for authority, expectation of natural providence, and code of sharing and honour, is often utterly broken. Some turn to drink or give in to the inevitable by taking up low-paid menial work. \nIn this fashion, through neglect, abuse and misunderstanding, an ancient way of life is being finally extinguished by the imperatives of local agriculture and its state support, reducing biodiversity to dusty waste. Yet, Suzman argues, even now the Bushmen have much to teach us about a social order that, in many ways, offered a freer, fairer existence and a non-invasive adaptation to ecology. \nSuzman and Scott have both written excellent books, which could serve on reading lists for geography, history and politics, as well as in their natural homes of archaeology and anthropology.

box can survive outside the body Donated hearts will travel better Bettmann/Getty By Clare Wilson \nA new way of keeping hearts alive but \u201casleep\u201d in a box outside the body for a day or more could bring an end to people dying on the heart transplant waiting list. \nThe system was tested on the first patient in August, albeit with the heart kept in this state for just 3 hours, New Scientist can reveal. It will be tested on another five people for this same time and, if all goes well, the time will be gradually raised to 24 hours. Stig Steen at Lund University in Sweden, who developed the technique, says it could potentially be used for up to several days. \nAny ability to keep hearts alive for longer outside the body boosts the number available for transplants. There is a shortage of all organs for transplant, with over a thousand people in the UK dying every year for want of one. \nIn England, the shortfall may be eased by the forthcoming switch to an \u201copt-out\u201d system of organ donation, announced last week. But it won\u2019t disappear, partly because only a fraction of people who die in hospital have organs suitable for donation, and families will still be able to override their relatives\u2019 wishes. \nWith hearts, a particular problem is distance between the donor and the patient, because hearts can only be kept alive outside the body for a few hours before weakening. \u201cNow we say no to a lot of good hearts,\u201d says Steen. \u201cWith the new way, we can take hearts from theoretically the whole world. We can get the perfect fit for each patient.\u201d To continue reading this premium article, subscribe for unlimited access.

But Abdessattar Abdelkefi and his team at New Mexico State University did just that while trying to devise better drones. \nMany large soaring birds like the albatross have wings that are white underneath and black on top. Previous explanations focused on camouflage, says Graham Martin at the University of Birmingham, UK. Advertisement \nBut does that colouring really boost endurance in flight? Most soaring needs no flapping of wings; instead, the bird exploits air currents to glide. \nAbdelkefi\u2019s team discovered that a wing\u2019s black upper surface absorbs sunlight very efficiently, causing it to be around 10\u00b0C warmer than the lower surface. That effectively lowers air pressure on the upper surface, lowering drag and generating extra lift ( Journal of Thermal Biology , doi.org/f96ggw ). \nSvana Rogalla at the University of Ghent, Belgium, says thermography has proved that the dark upper wing gets hotter in sunlight , but it is too early to pin down its effect on drag. The impact of colour on flight could be a further inducement for birds to make costly melanin pigment to darken feathers, she says. \nThe team hopes the findings will help them design more efficient and durable drones for use at sea. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cAlbatross teaches drones new tricks\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frans lanting/national geographic cre", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "svana rogalla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdessattar abdelkefi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdelkefi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graham martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of ghent", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T15:27:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d5af8ab906841f2da87e12c25175515f8c9a4b06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLau1Fe8sJGfbth5Zvobs0UtVUlu3Vh3SqIMi3o.Hwh12WEd08wgXJHZ.gbBDaipZ2DRrtz2mdVSHfHOFkdM2gqtg-", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/mental-health", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Will Alphabet\u2019s internet balloons really help Puerto Rico?", "title_full": "Will Alphabet\u2019s internet balloons really help Puerto Rico?", "published": "2017-10-10T15:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10124300/rtsf2cb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 99, "comments": 0, "shares": 99}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d5af8ab906841f2da87e12c25175515f8c9a4b06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh.bUzkHp0qLau1Fe8sJGfbth5Zvobs0UtVUlu3Vh3SqIMi3o.Hwh12WEd08wgXJHZ.gbBDaipZ2DRrtz2mdVSHfHOFkdM2gqtg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T15:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will Alphabet\u2019s internet balloons really help Puerto Rico?", "text": "Will Alphabet\u2019s internet balloons really help Puerto Rico?

New York Times/Redux/Eyevine By Matt Reynolds \nPREDICTIVE policing that aims to work out when and where a crime will take place promises a future of data-driven law enforcement. But a flaw found in the design of the software used suggests that instead of fixing biases in policing, predictive algorithms are to blame for a whole new set of problems. \nPre-crime tech is catching on in the US. PredPol \u2013 a market-leading system \u2013 is already used by police departments in places such as California, Florida and Maryland. Their hope is that such systems will bring down crime rates while simultaneously reducing human bias in policing. \nBut when researchers in the US examined how PredPol predicts crime, they found something disturbing. Their study suggests that the software merely sparks a \u201cfeedback loop\u201d that leads to officers being repeatedly sent to certain neighbourhoods \u2013 typically ones with a high number of racial minorities \u2013 regardless of the true crime rate in that area ( arxiv.org/abs/1706.09847 ). Advertisement \nThe problem stems from the logic that PredPol uses to decide where officers should be sent. If an officer is sent to a neighbourhood and then makes an arrest, the software takes this as indicating a good chance of more crimes in that area in future. \nWhat this means, says Matt Kusner at the Alan Turing Institute in London, is that the PredPol system seems to be learning from arrest rates \u2013 which are higher in areas where there are more police \u2013 rather than from underlying crime rates. \n\u201cThat\u2019s how dangerous feedback loops are,\u201d says Joshua Loftus at New York University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Although these loops are only part of how PredPol makes its predictions, he says they may explain why predictive policing algorithms have sometimes seemed to recreate exactly the kind of racial biases their creators say they overcome. \u201cA \u2018feedback loop\u2019 in software leads to officers being repeatedly sent to certain neighbourhoods\u201d \nTo better understand how the system comes to its conclusions, the study team created a simplified mathematical model of the PredPol software. The algorithm chooses how to distribute a certain number of officers between two locations. If more are sent to one location, they tend to make more arrests there. The team found that this feeds back into the system and leads it to send even more officers to that same place. \nThat means the software ends up overestimating the crime rate in one neighbourhood, without taking into account the possibility that more crime is observed there simply because more officers have been sent there \u2013 like a computerised version of confirmation bias. \nThere might be a way to stop the feedback loop. The authors also modelled a different system, in which the algorithm only sent more officers to a neighbourhood if the area\u2019s crime rate was higher than expected. This led it to distribute officers in a way that much more closely matched the true crime rate. \nLoftus says that many more problems need to be solved before policing algorithms can be truly called fair. \u201cHuman decisions affect every aspect of the design of the system,\u201d he says. The algorithm could be thrown off if officers are more likely to arrest racial minorities, for example. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cA flaw in the pre-crime system\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loftus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joshua loftus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt kusner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan turing institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T16:09:20.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea885503c18198708609faa06c1ac7800988cd2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX5UJKWOD5x8yKnGqzJDErACdnk64MAZrEVD_F9M30VRSqRBo2EDISqoWtA.8YSvudrYRy3yssc5rz..7IY5xbIjjiTiTPkbm.Q--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/energy-fuels", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "The dearth of women in tech is nothing to do with testosterone", "title_full": "The dearth of women in tech is nothing to do with testosterone", "published": "2017-10-10T16:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10133516/gettyimages-107070353.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 499, "comments": 0, "shares": 499}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea885503c18198708609faa06c1ac7800988cd2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX5UJKWOD5x8yKnGqzJDErACdnk64MAZrEVD_F9M30VRSqRBo2EDISqoWtA.8YSvudrYRy3yssc5rz..7IY5xbIjjiTiTPkbm.Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T16:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "The dearth of women in tech is nothing to do with testosterone", "text": "10 October 2017 The dearth of women in tech is nothing to do with testosterone Arguments over the causes of the gender gap in STEM jobs rage on.

Someone next to me used the word \u201cCommonwealth\u201d without irony. Would there have been such a spirit without Brexit? Probably not: this is a show about the genius of another country that very much wants to project Britain\u2019s own global aspirations. Any historian of Anglo-British relations will give a sardonic smile at this. \nWhen you visit (and you should), try to look around the smaller, artefacts-driven gallery first. Advertisement \nThis room tells the stories of Indian science \u2013 stories plural because there can never be one, linear account of how such dissimilar and contesting cultures struggled and more or less succeeded in understanding and exploiting a space of such extraordinary complexity. \nNaturally, since India has a past to boast of, pride of place goes to its indigenous cultures. It was the Indus valley civilisation, after all, whose peoples fashioned standardised weights around 4000 years ago: items that indicate high levels of arithmetical literacy, communication and trade. Ancient surgery \nAnd there are reconstructions of Ayurvedic surgical instruments described in records dating back to around 500 BC. Also on show is a 1800-year-old document containing the first example of the use of zero. Wonderfully, radiocarbon dating pushed the document\u2019s age back by 500 years just before the exhibition opened. \nIt is a measure of the wisdom of the curators that such an illustrious past isn\u2019t allowed to overshadow India\u2019s more recent achievements. For example, Jagadish Chandra Bose\u2019s early-20th-century crescograph, designed to observe plant growth at a magnification of 10,000 times, reminds us why he is often called the father of modern Indian science. Replica Ayurvedic tool Science Museum Group \nAnother winning object is Chandrasekhara Raman\u2019s spectrometer. Raman was the first Indian to win a Nobel prize, for physics, in 1930. \nAnd what of that other great empire far to the north? Well, there is a map of George Everest\u2019s career-defining Great Trigonometrical Survey of India \u2013 the teamwork of 70 years distilled on a single, meticulously drawn map. And nearby are details of a recent collaboration between Surrey Satellite Technology in the UK and the Indian Space Research Organisation on the Earth-surveying NovaSAR satellite. \nSome of the deeper, darker questions about Anglo-Indian relations are posed in the second, photographic half of the exhibition. Split nature \nThere, the anthropometric photographs of Maurice Portman make a depressingly silly impression next to the respectful, revealing and entirely unlicentious photographs Ram Singh took of the women of his own harem: powerful political players all, who shaped the country through marriage and allied treaties. \nIt is hard to say why the split nature of Illuminating India works as well as it does. It has something to do with the way the rooms handle political power. \nIndia\u2019s science, from its ancient stepwells that gathered monsoon waters to the bureaucratic and algorithmic marvel that is today\u2019s tiffin tin-based lunch delivery system, has been driven by the complex needs of a massive population making a living. \nSimilarly, its doing-more-with-less style of innovation is reflected in everything from the world\u2019s cheapest artificial leg (the Jaipur leg , made of rubber, plastic and wood) to the world\u2019s cheapest Mars-orbiting camera. \nVisitors to Illuminating India will leave thinking that technology may, after all, be making the world a better place, and that what people do is ultimately more influential than who they are. \nIlluminating India: 5000 years of science and innovation and Illuminating India: Photography 1857 \u2013 2017 are at the Science Museum, London, until 31 March 2018 \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chandrasekhara raman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george everest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ram singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chila burman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurice portman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jagadish chandra bose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon ings  one", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "science museum group  another", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "science museum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian space research organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey satellite technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "science museum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaipur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T18:35:21.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f16b3f312e4b5d0f397c20668622b0b946486c93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX8vR7xAAreDAE5ScA4nJq7ju9d7i.GfYDXILTun8xzYhswZx5_JV.PGlX0qqnIy8.PANu.j78dmZjmuhBPhbAYUZJjCG8n44jw--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/books-art", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "It was always mad to shoot for Mars before colonising the moon", "title_full": "It was always mad to shoot for Mars before colonising the moon", "published": "2017-10-10T18:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10152621/comment-moon.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f16b3f312e4b5d0f397c20668622b0b946486c93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX8vR7xAAreDAE5ScA4nJq7ju9d7i.GfYDXILTun8xzYhswZx5_JV.PGlX0qqnIy8.PANu.j78dmZjmuhBPhbAYUZJjCG8n44jw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T18:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "It was always mad to shoot for Mars before colonising the moon", "text": "It was always mad to shoot for Mars before colonising the moon More moon bases needed ESA \nThe good news is that this apparently kicks the fashionable but faintly absurd idea of attempting to colonise Mars ahead of the moon into the long grass.

Female bottlenose dolphins can control the paternity of their offspring Flip Nicklin/Minden Pictures/FLPA By Josh Gabbatiss \nSome female dolphins have evolved a secret weapon in their sexual arms race with males: vaginas that protect them from fertilisation by unwelcome partners. \nPenises come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, especially in dolphins and other cetaceans. That seems to imply a similar diversity in vaginas, but Dara Orbach of Dalhousie University, Canada, says there is \u201ca huge lag\u201d in our understanding of female genitalia. \nThat is partly because it is tricky to visualise vaginal structure. To overcome this problem, Orbach has created silicone moulds of cetaceans\u2019 vaginas, revealing complex folds and spirals. Advertisement \n\u201cThere\u2019s this unparalleled level of vaginal diversity that we had no idea existed before,\u201d Orbach says. \nSimilarly complex vaginal structures are found in several species of duck. Orbach\u2019s collaborator Patricia Brennan of Mount Holyoke College, Massachusetts, has previously found evidence that duck vaginas have evolved to make it harder for males to force copulation . So Orbach wondered if female cetaceans\u2019 unusual vaginas had also evolved to keep out unwanted sperm. \nOrbach, Brennan and their colleagues obtained genitals from marine mammals that had died of natural causes: common and bottlenose dolphins, common porpoises and common seals . They inflated the males\u2019 penises with saline to see how they looked when they were erect, and compared them with the vaginal moulds. They also took CT scans of penises inserted into the corresponding vaginas, to determine whether they fitted in easily and the best positions. Take back control \nThe vaginas of the common dolphin and common seal seemed amenable to penetration, suggesting their genitalia had evolved to allow males access. But the common porpoise and bottlenose dolphin had extensive vaginal folds that obstructed penis entry. \nMale bottlenose dolphins form alliances two to four strong to keep competitors away from females. When confronted by such an alliance, a female has little choice in who mates with her, and may mate with everyone. \nHowever, vaginal folds could grant her some agency, says Janet Mann of Georgetown University in Washington DC. \u201cShe may not choose who she mates with, but might be able to choose which male or, more precisely, which sperm, fertilises her egg.\u201d \nIn all four species studied, the ideal position for successful fertilisation appeared to be the male on top with his penis hooked underneath the female. Any deviation from this tended to result in unsuccessful penetration. That is consistent with Orbach and Mann\u2019s observations of wild porpoises and dolphins mating. \nThis combination of precise positioning and complex vaginal structures means that subtle mid-copulation movements by females could send the penis the wrong way in their vaginas, preventing fertilisation. \n\u201cIt might appear behaviourally that females are very passive,\u201d says Orbach. \u201cBut looking at the reproductive anatomy, we\u2019re learning that they have all sorts of cryptic ways to control paternity.\u201d \nJournal reference: Proceedings of the Royal Society B , DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2017.1265 \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh gabbatiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dara orbach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orbach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brennan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet mann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patricia brennan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dalhousie university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount holyoke college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T03:33:55.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1af8230a2d49f27568b3f2249f828d56449e6ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowfhq5t83Dr.WcY_iuSQsbMd5Pfoldd9eDSVxoAuF8Eck87Uq5JIU.x28LHCYzEcVVc3_xyUG39K", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "", "title": "We urgently need to broaden the conversation on AI", "title_full": "We urgently need to broaden the conversation on AI", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04180000/gettyimages-505451906.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1af8230a2d49f27568b3f2249f828d56449e6ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXowfhq5t83Dr.WcY_iuSQsbMd5Pfoldd9eDSVxoAuF8Eck87Uq5JIU.x28LHCYzEcVVc3_xyUG39K", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "We urgently need to broaden the conversation on AI", "text": "5 We urgently need to broaden the conversation on AI \nIt\u2019s time to get past the scare stories and start discussing the real uses and abuses of machine learning ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T05:20:04.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a983129eb6e3266f138c9181cc391a15cf934654", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo_HxUAMrUmNSlqeg4Efv4ZUbnTo.PcQi9WwfaFumQdIUGCr0whk4FCh5DX8rtUlNDyKXSRJkQL8RBD4yxqqgPSpeUWNkd3EV7g--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist -

Are you getting enough shut-eye, asks sleep scientist Matthew Walker Julia Yellow By Matthew Walker \nI DON\u2019T mean to pry, but how much sleep did you get last night? What about over the past week? I ask because the answer could have serious consequences for your future mental health. \nMore than 44 million people worldwide currently have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, including members of my own family. The health, economic and personal impact is staggering. There has been a marked acceleration in the number being diagnosed with the disease as the human lifespan has increased, but importantly, as total sleep time has decreased . Read more: Top tips to get a better night\u2019s sleep and improve your health \nAs a sleep scientist, I became interested in this connection some years ago. What I have found is striking. Not only does sleep disruption play a role in the declining mental abilities that typify Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but getting enough sleep is one of the most important factors determining whether you will develop the condition in the future. \nThe implications are huge. We are quickly filling in missing pieces of the Alzheimer\u2019s puzzle, and now we also recognise that sleep offers a route for diagnosis, therapy and even prevention. \nAs we age, our sleep gets worse . This is especially true for the quality of our deep, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (see chart ). Unfortunately, this is the very type of sleep that we now know helps fix new memories into the architecture of the brain , preventing you from forgetting. \nBut if you assess a patient with Alzheimer\u2019s disease , the disruption of deep sleep is exaggerated.

Wildfires have torched almost 30,000 hectares, mostly in the wine-growing regions of Napa and Sonoma counties, including the area around Santa Rosa. \nThe US National Weather Service (NWS) issued a red-flag warning on Tuesday, blaming near-perfect fire conditions.

Michael Arrington, founder of tech news site TechCrunch, used real estate start-up Propy to help him snap up the home without setting foot in the country. The transaction took place entirely via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain using cryptocurrency. \nBlockchains are cryptographically secure ledgers that store every transaction made in a system across many different computers, protecting them from fraud. Originally designed to support digital currencies, they promise to revolutionise far more than monetary transactions. The tech has already allowed people to trade things like excess energy from their solar panels , and to participate in a form of direct voting called liquid democracy . Little wonder \u201cdisrupting\u201d real estate has been a long-standing promise of blockchains. \nMoving international property transactions onto a blockchain should speed up the process of conveyancing and exchanging of paper contracts. It also should make transactions more transparent and properties easier to sell to overseas buyers. Advertisement \nSan Francisco-based Propy is not the first to try to use the blockchain. Global real estate outfit REX is creating a global property listing service to connect sellers, buyers and agents across multiple countries. ATLANT, based in New York, is experimenting with a form of blockchain-supported property ownership where many people can co-own a property in much the same way shareholders jointly own a company. \nBut Propy is the first to understand that transactions need government involvement. \u201cPeople can do property swaps all they want but without a government to enforce them, it\u2019s meaningless,\u201d says Paul Madore, who writes reports on blockchain start-ups for investors. \nReal estate transactions need to be recorded in an official ledger that is legally binding and recognised by all parties. In the UK, this is the government-controlled Land Registry. Propy envisions that different jurisdictions will adopt the Propy registry as their official ledger. This would mean that simply transferring property via Propy would count as a legal transfer of ownership. \u201cMaking a traditionally bureaucratic process simpler and more transparent is a short-term win,\u201d says Nina Jankowicz, a Fulbright-Clinton public policy fellow in Ukraine. \nPropy is working with Ukraine\u2019s e-government agency and ministry of justice. CEO Natalia Karayaneva says the company is also in talks with officials in Vermont, California and Dubai. \u201cThey are figuring out which laws they need to change,\u201d she says. \nBlockchain technology will inevitably power property transactions in the near future, says Madore. But companies like Propy may not be running the show. \u201cPropy expects the governments of the world to bend to its will,\u201d he says. Governments are slow to change, but most will want to develop their own blockchain platforms, he says. \nIf you read Propy\u2019s small print, the company knows this too, says Madore. If something goes wrong, it can\u2019t help you, he says. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cNeed a home?

They gave these cells a cocktail of chemicals to prevent them from maturing, trapping them in a very young, primordial state. \nThe team has named them \u201cexpanded-potential stem cells\u201d (EPSCs), because \u2013 unlike any other stem cells in the lab \u2013 they are able to create placenta and yolk sac tissue. These tissues are essential for supporting embryonic and fetal development, and many pregnancies fail because of unknown problems with these tissues. Advertisement \nLiu\u2019s team also found that the same chemical cocktail can rewind other types of stem cell back to the same primordial state as EPSCs. This means that researchers should be able to turn embryonic stem cells (which are taken from older embryos) and induced pluripotent stem cells (which are created from mature cells from skin or elsewhere) into EPSCs. \u201cWe can erase all memories in these cells and take them back to the equivalent of a blank piece of paper,\u201d says Liu. \n\u201cThis is very exciting research that lays the foundation for generating EPSCs from human embryos,\u201d says Jan Brosens of the University of Warwick. \u201cSuch a resource would enable us to study how the developing embryo could be protected from an adverse womb environment and potentially lead to new treatments to prevent recurrent miscarriage.\u201d Journal reference: Nature , DOI: 10.1038/nature24052", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pentao liu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy coghlan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jan brosens", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sanger institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of warwick", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T21:15:52.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64ac9dfda62fcf812737a853987ec871cee1eb66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX9vf8evXVPDNYTpWNGj3oCQLpnq3YtaoIhFmNso2Fc5nhc1d9HVgFxho0WvOdlLi7nvd9C9_kPo945Hm_JXpj0P9Np7STl.9Hg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Distant dwarf planet near Pluto has a ring that no one expected", "title_full": "Distant dwarf planet near Pluto has a ring that no one expected", "published": "2017-10-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/11170731/haumea.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 927, "comments": 0, "shares": 927}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 34}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64ac9dfda62fcf812737a853987ec871cee1eb66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX9vf8evXVPDNYTpWNGj3oCQLpnq3YtaoIhFmNso2Fc5nhc1d9HVgFxho0WvOdlLi7nvd9C9_kPo945Hm_JXpj0P9Np7STl.9Hg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Distant dwarf planet near Pluto has a ring that no one expected", "text": "Distant dwarf planet near Pluto has a ring that no one expected Haumea: egg-shaped and ringed IAA-CSIC/UHU By Ken Croswell \nA ring has been found around Haumea, a world more than 2 billion kilometres beyond Pluto. The ring is the most distant ever seen in our solar system. \n\u201cThis is a landmark discovery,\u201d says Alan Stern at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting.\u201d \nUntil recently, the only known rings circled giant planets such as Saturn. In 2013, however, astronomers found two rings around Chariklo , an odd little rock about 250 kilometres across between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. Chiron, one of Chariklo\u2019s neighbours, may also have a ring. Advertisement \nNow astronomers have found a ring beyond Neptune. Jos\u00e9-Luis Ortiz and Pablo Santos-Sanz at the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Granada, Spain, and their colleagues watched the dwarf planet Haumea pass in front of a dim red star in the constellation Bo\u00f6tes on 21 January this year. A total of 12 telescopes in six European countries tracked the eclipse. \nThe duration of the eclipse revealed Haumea\u2019s size and shape. But before and after it moved completely in front of the star, a ring around Haumea\u2019s equator blocked some of the starlight. \u201cIt was really an amazing surprise,\u201d says Santos-Sanz. The ring is 70 kilometres wide and about 2290 kilometres from Haumea\u2019s centre. Spinning like a top \n\u201cThis is fabulous. It\u2019s a really great discovery,\u201d says William McKinnon at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. \nHe says that Haumea\u2019s many odd properties may provide clues on how it came to have a ring in the first place. The far-off world is shaped like an egg, which may result from its whirlwind rotation. Haumea completes a full spin every 3 hours and 55 minutes, whereas the dwarf planet Pluto, which is almost perfectly round, rotates every 6.4 Earth days. Every 24 hours, a resident on Haumea\u2019s equator would see six sunrises and six sunsets. It also has two small moons. \nMcKinnon suspects that all these traits are linked. He thinks a large object may have hit Haumea, causing it to spin and eject debris that created both the ring and the moons. \nThis impact would also explain another phenomenon: several other bodies travel on almost the same path around the sun as Haumea and share its composition, having water ice on their surfaces. They could all have been born during the same initial smash-up. Shiny new worlds \nOrtiz and Santos-Sanz also found that Haumea is slightly larger than once thought: at its widest, it is nearly the diameter of Pluto, the largest-known object orbiting the sun beyond Neptune.

Luca Trovato/The Image Bank/Getty By Jessica Hamzelou \nFor the first time, researchers have shown that being born by C-section can contribute to obesity in mice. This probably happens because the procedure disrupts a newborn\u2019s microbiome. \nUntil fairly recently, babies were thought to be born with sterile guts free from bacteria. But we now know that babies are born with a gutful of microbes , and that at least some of these come from a mother\u2019s vaginal canal during birth. \nBabies born by C-section are thought to miss out on these bacteria, which could explain why their microbiomes look different . The ecosystem of microbes that live inside us has been implicated in a range of health issues, so this may explain why babies born by C-section are more likely to grow up overweight, and to develop allergies and asthma in later life. \nTo test if C-sections really do lead to heavier babies, Maria Dominguez-Bello at New York University and her colleagues performed C-sections on 34 pregnant mice, and compared the resulting pups to 35 that were born vaginally. By the time the mice had grown into adults 15 weeks later, there were stark difference in body weight between the two groups. The mice born by C-section were, on average, 33 per cent heavier than those born vaginally. Heavier females \nFemales seemed particularly affected, says Dominguez-Bello. While the C-section males were around 20 per cent heavier than their vaginally-born counterparts, the females were 70 per cent heavier, she says. \u201cWe were very surprised to see this,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have no idea why it\u2019s happening.\u201d \nThe microbiomes of the C-section mice also looked different to those born vaginally. By the time they were four weeks old, the C-section mice had lower levels of some bacterial species and more of others. The team don\u2019t know whether these changes might impact the mice\u2019s health. \nWhile the C-section mice are heavier, it isn\u2019t clear whether they are actually unhealthy. They don\u2019t have a higher proportion of body fat \u2013 rather, it seems that their bones, fat and tissues just grow much more than vaginally-born mice. Vaginal swabbing \nThe team think that being deprived of the bacteria in the vaginal canal could somehow prime pups \u2013 and possibly human babies \u2013 for obesity later in life. \nPhillip Bennett of Imperial College London isn\u2019t convinced the findings apply to humans. Mice have a diverse range of vaginal bacteria, while in people, the vaginal microbiome is largely dominated by a single strain . \nAt any rate, C-section births don\u2019t hugely increase the risk of obesity in human children, says Bennett. \u201cYou\u2019re 1.3 times more likely to be obese if you\u2019re delivered by Caesarean section than vaginally,\u201d he says. But this statistic might be warped by the fact that obese mothers are more likely to require the surgery, as are women who are pregnant with larger babies. \nDominguez-Bello and her colleagues have been swabbing newborn C-section babies with vaginal fluids from their mothers to see if this has a beneficial effect. She doesn\u2019t recommend the practice though, because she doesn\u2019t know yet if it works, and there is a risk that the procedure could cause infections.

They then repeated the experiment but had their partners stimulate them. Advertisement \nWise\u2019s custom-fitted head stabiliser allowed the team to follow brain activity in 20 second intervals to see what happens just before, during, and after an orgasm . Pain relief \nBack in 1985, Wise\u2019s colleagues Beverly Whipple and Barry Komisaruk , both at Rutgers, discovered that, during self-stimulation and orgasm, women are less likely to notice painful squeezing of a finger, and can tolerate more of this pain. They found that women\u2019s ability to withstand pain increased by 75 per cent during stimulation, while the level of squeezing at which women noticed the pain more than doubled. \nNow Wise\u2019s team has explained why. At the point of orgasm, the dorsal raphe nucleus area of the brain becomes more active. This region plays a role in controlling the release of the brain chemical serotonin, which can act as an analgesic, dampening the sensation of pain. \nHer team also saw a burst of activity in the nucleus cuneiformis, which is a part of brainstem systems that are thought to help us control pain through thought alone. \n\u201cTogether, this activity \u2013 at least in part \u2013 seems to account for the pain attenuating effect of the female orgasm,\u201d says Wise. Turn on, not off \nWise\u2019s team also found evidence that overturns the assumption that the female brain \u201cswitches off\u201d during orgasm . \nIn 2005, Gert Holstege at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands used a PET scanner to analyse brain activity in 13 women while they were resting, faking an orgasm and being stimulated by their partner to orgasm. While activity in sensory regions of the brain increased during orgasm, activity fell in large number of regions \u2013 including those involved in emotion \u2013 compared with their brain at rest. \nBased on this finding, it was suggested that women have to be free from worries and distractions in order to climax. From an evolutionary point of view, the brain might switch off its emotional areas because the chance to produce offspring is more important than the immediate survival to the individual. \nBut the new study saw the opposite: brain activity in regions responsible for movement, senses, memory and emotions all gradually increased during the lead-up to orgasm, when activity then peaked and lowered again. \u201cWe found no evidence of deactivation of brain regions during orgasm,\u201d says Wise. \nThe difference between the two studies may be because PET can only get a small snapshot of brain activity over a short period of time, unlike fMRI scanners. Better understanding \nIt\u2019s not yet clear why pain sensation decreases during orgasm, or if men experience the same phenomenon. It may be that, in order to feel pleasure in the brain, the neural circuits that process pain have to be dampened down. \nWhipple suggests that the pain-dampening effects of the female orgasm could be related to child birth. Her research suggests that pain sensitivity is reduced when the baby\u2019s head emerges through the birth canal. Vaginal stimulation may therefore reduce pain in order to help mothers cope with the final stages of birth, and promote initial bonding with the baby. \nThe ability to study what happens during stimulation and orgasm could be used to better understand and treat those who have mood disorders like anhedonia \u2013 the inability to experience pleasure, says Wise. \u201cWe know so little about pleasure in the brain, we are just now learning the basics.\u201d \nYou might wonder what it\u2019s like to participate in such experiments. Wise says people often think her participants must be exhibitionists, but it\u2019s not the case, she says. \u201cSome women do like that aspect, but most are doing it because it\u2019s empowering to them. Some find it difficult to orgasm, others don\u2019t. One of our participants in this experiment was a 74-year-old lady who had two fabulous orgasms in the machine.

The Atlantic and Pacific oceans are swallowed. Where once there were beaches, great mountain ranges judder into the skies, fusing together a scatter of separate land masses into one mighty new supercontinent. Call it\u2026 Aurica. \nThat\u2019s what Jo\u00e3o Duarte calls it, anyway. A geoscientist at the University of Lisbon, Portugal, he has his own distinct vision of how Earth may look 250 million years from now. He joins a band of fortune tellers gazing into the distant future, all with different ideas about how and where the next supercontinent will form, and what cataclysms might strike along the way. \nThe answer will determine Earth\u2019s future climate and prospects for sustaining life. But getting it right requires grappling with a machine whose workings we still understand only imperfectly: that of plate tectonics. \nEarth\u2019s surface is clad in rigid rock plates \u2013 together called the lithosphere \u2013 formed of surface crustal rock laminated on to hard cold mantle rocks. Given their rigidity, it is surprising that these plates don\u2019t simply lock together, unmoving. And indeed, until about 50 years ago geologists thought that Earth\u2019s land masses were fixed, despite German geophysicist Alfred Wegener having proposed the idea of continental drift in 1915. \nThe creation and destruction of ocean basins makes plate motion possible. Plates move apart at mid-ocean ridges, where molten rock rises and cools to form hard, dense basalt. They move together at subduction zones, where old ocean lithosphere plunges under a neighbouring plate . As it penetrates the warmer, softer mantle beneath, it causes earthquakes and feeds volcanoes. \nMagnetic signals recorded in sea-floor rocks, To continue reading this premium article, subscribe for unlimited access.

Here\u2019s his advice on how to sleep better and reap the benefits.

For example, a recent report demonstrated that disrupted sleep significantly lowers your mood . \nThat\u2019s because when your sleep is interrupted, you don\u2019t have time to go through all the restorative sleep stages.

For example, a study limited healthy young adults to 4-hours of sleep for one night. The next day there was a measurable effect on their immune system.

So says a report on air quality from the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen, Denmark. \n\u201cAir pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe,\u201d says the EEA. \nBy far the biggest killer was PM2.5, the soup of tiny particles measuring 2.5 micrometres across or less. These claimed an estimated 428,000 premature deaths across the 41 European countries tracked in 2014. The main source, contributing 57 per cent of PM2.5 emissions in 2015, was domestic wood burning , especially in eastern Europe. Advertisement \nNitrogen dioxide, mostly from vehicle exhausts, cut short an estimated 78,000 lives across the same 41 countries. Ground-level ozone was the other major killer, claiming an estimated 14,400 lives prematurely . \n\u201cHeart disease and stroke are the most common reasons for premature death attributable to air pollution, and are responsible for 80 per cent of cases,\u201d the report says. Air pollution also contributes to other respiratory diseases and cancer, and has non-lethal impacts on diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, pregnancy and brain development in children. Hotspots of bad air \nThe two worst hotspots for PM2.5 pollution were Poland and northern Italy, where dozens of cities exceeded the EU\u2019s annual mean limit of 25 micrograms of particles per cubic metre of air. \u201cPoland and the Po valley have very bad pollution,\u201d says Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez Ortiz, the report\u2019s lead author. \nThe worst offender was the city of Krakow in Poland, where the PM2.5 value was 44 micrograms. Levels also reached 40 micrograms in Macedonia. More than a dozen Polish cities exceeded 30 micrograms, as did cities in northern Italy including Milan, Padua, Cremona, Brescia, Venice and Turin. \nIn all, 7 to 8 per cent of Europe\u2019s urban population was exposed to PM2.5 concentrations that exceeded the EU limit. But when the World Health Organization\u2019s stricter limit of 10 micrograms was used as a benchmark, between 82 and 85 per cent of urban Europeans were exposed. \nThe UK saw an estimated 37,600 premature deaths from PM2.5 exposure in 2014. The worst hotspot was 16 micrograms, along London\u2019s Marylebone Road, followed by 15 micrograms on a roadside in Haringey, north London. \nBut the UK also saw many premature deaths from exposure to nitrogen dioxide : about 14,000. This was compounded by widespread use of diesel fuel in vehicles . In one part of London, the annual limit for nitrogen dioxide was exceeded as early as 6 January this year . In September, London mayor Sadiq Khan triggered the capital\u2019s seventh emergency air quality alert since he introduced the system a year ago . Impacts from nitrogen dioxide were also high in Germany, France and Spain. \nOverall, emissions are falling, but slowly, says Ortiz. He says the air would get cleaner faster if countries further limited their numbers of vehicles, burned cleaner fuels for heating and created more pedestrianised areas. Ortiz also recommends adapting infrastructure to suit cycling and promoting wider use of public transport. \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "beata zawre", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sadiq khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberto gonz\u00e1lez ortiz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy coghlan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ortiz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european environment agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cremona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haringey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "padua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copenhagen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brescia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krakow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macedonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marylebone road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T18:04:43.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96cee2b5b989f8b2fe790d02a595d01fff34ac18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXxUvJtc8JQewCEW7G6Aad_BoGY2N4Y.lWH81TcaB7cTsF59PwwsEI5SUDgstPL4H_KANx71ka2mmd5W0zdNy32GnG.wtM6QneA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/mental-health", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Perfectly preserved fossil salamander even has last meal in gut", "title_full": "Perfectly preserved fossil salamander even has last meal in gut", "published": "2017-10-12T18:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/12145818/salamander.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 345, "comments": 0, "shares": 345}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96cee2b5b989f8b2fe790d02a595d01fff34ac18", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXxUvJtc8JQewCEW7G6Aad_BoGY2N4Y.lWH81TcaB7cTsF59PwwsEI5SUDgstPL4H_KANx71ka2mmd5W0zdNy32GnG.wtM6QneA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T18:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Perfectly preserved fossil salamander even has last meal in gut", "text": "Perfectly preserved fossil salamander even has last meal in gut Preserved frog bones from an ancient salamander\u2019s stomach J\u00e9r\u00e9my Tissier CC BY By Richa Malhotra \nThe fossil of an extinct salamander is so exquisitely preserved that the remains of its last meal \u2013 a frog \u2013 can be seen in its gut. \nThe fossil comes from the site of the Quercy phosphorites in south-west France, which has thrown up many vertebrate fossils over the years. This is despite a large number of specimens probably being destroyed by phosphate mining in the 19th and 20th centuries. \nThe salamander fossil had remained largely forgotten in the French National Museum of Natural History for decades, until J\u00e9r\u00e9my Tissier of the JURASSICA Museum in Porrentruy, Switzerland, and his colleagues took a closer look. \nThey scanned the fossil using advanced imaging techniques, and named it Phosphotriton sigei after the phosphorus-rich sediments of Quercy. It is the only known fossil of this species, with a search in museums and sediment deposits coming up empty. \nThe salamander died 34 to 40 million years ago, yet aside from its skeleton, many of its soft tissues are preserved: an initial examination identified skin and a lung. These were protected by a process called permineralisation, sometimes loosely known as \u201cmummification\u201d. Under this mechanism, minerals from groundwater seep into a buried animal and fill any empty pockets, or even individual cells. \nThis type of soft tissue preservation is rare, says Dean Lomax at the University of Manchester, UK. Frog-muncher \nWhen Tissier and his colleagues revisited the scan, they spotted other tissues, including digestive tract, nerves, muscles and an unidentified organ. But the \u201cbig surprise\u201d came when they examined the digestive tract and found frog bones inside. \nThose bones comprised four vertebrae and a 5-millimetre-long limb bone. \u201cIt was clear that they didn\u2019t belong to the salamander, because they were in the wrong position and too small,\u201d Tissier says. He isn\u2019t sure whether the frog bones all belong to the same individual, but they do not come from any fully developed adults. \nRegardless, the finding makes P. sigei the only extinct salamander known to have consumed frogs. \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t expect frog bones,\u201d says Tissier, because modern salamanders rarely eat those animals. \n\u201cThe frog was really small, which may have made it easier for the salamander to catch it,\u201d he adds. The prey was just 18-20 millimetres long, whereas the salamander may have been 150 mm \u2013 although the fossil is only about 60mm long because it is missing its head and parts of its tail and neck. \nMost present-day salamanders feed on invertebrates, with their mouths too small to consume large vertebrates, says herpetologist Sara Viernum . \u201cBut if they can fit a vertebrate prey in their mouths, they typically will eat it.\u201d The frog\u2019s small relative size may have doomed it. \nJournal reference: PeerJ , DOI: 10.7717/peerj.3861 \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dean lomax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara viernum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tissier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j\u00e9r\u00e9my tissier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richa malhotra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of manchester", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "porrentruy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T18:17:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "baa4fc7d02f4af4f915730b40a247edb0f7ac90d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX04RCUqZbwZC1xkJJJ9SySXZCGgzQMNSmOM3ZZqAeAtBd1JhJgxmBU2iK50sKF2HW1sPfAMVC413cpfAavntMmb55Epdc9XvXw--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/exploring-mars", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Did blind cavefish evolve by breaking the laws of evolution?", "title_full": "Did blind cavefish evolve by breaking the laws of evolution?", "published": "2017-10-12T18:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/12153411/fx2mjy.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1296, "comments": 0, "shares": 1296}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "baa4fc7d02f4af4f915730b40a247edb0f7ac90d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX04RCUqZbwZC1xkJJJ9SySXZCGgzQMNSmOM3ZZqAeAtBd1JhJgxmBU2iK50sKF2HW1sPfAMVC413cpfAavntMmb55Epdc9XvXw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T18:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Did blind cavefish evolve by breaking the laws of evolution?", "text": "Did blind cavefish evolve by breaking the laws of evolution? Evolutionary insight VPC Animals Photo/Alamy Stock Photo By Michael Le Page \nWe\u2019ve found out why a Mexican cavefish has no eyes \u2013 and the surprising answer is likely to be seized upon by those who think the standard view of evolution needs revising. \nOver the past few million years, blind forms of the Mexican tetra ( Astyanax mexicanus ) have evolved in caves. Maintaining eyes and the visual parts of the brain uses lots of energy , so the loss of eyes is a big advantage for animals living in the dark. Instead the cavefish \u201csee\u201d by sucking . \nIt was assumed that these fish became blind because mutations disabled key genes involved in eye development. This has been shown to be the case for some other underground species that have lost their eyes. Advertisement \nBut Aniket Gore of the US\u2019s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and colleagues haven\u2019t found any disabling changes in the DNA sequences of eye development genes in the cavefish. \nInstead, the genes have been switched off by the addition of chemical tags called methyl groups. This is what is known as an epigenetic , rather than genetic, change. \n\u201cAlthough a central role for DNA methylation in development and disease has been well-documented, our results suggest that epigenetic processes can play an equally important role in adaptive evolution,\u201d the team writes. Faster evolution? \nThe researchers propose that this epigenetic mechanism allowed the cavefish to shed its eyes faster than if the change had happened via DNA mutations in eye genes. \nThat is a controversial suggestion, and one that will be music to the ears of those who think that evolution can occur via heritable epigenetic mechanisms, and that standard evolutionary theory needs to be broadened to include such processes . \n\u201cThis is a most interesting paper,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Douglas Futuyma of Stony Brook University in New York. But he doesn\u2019t think it poses any challenge to standard evolutionary theory as the epigenetic change is itself most likely a result of a genetic change. \nGore\u2019s team shows that the silencing of the eye genes is due to the increased activity of a specific gene involved in methylation, Futuyma points out. So the question then is, what is making this gene more active? \n\u201cI think it likely that there has been an alteration in DNA sequence of that gene,\u201d he says. \n\u201cYou cannot completely rule out genetic mutations,\u201d says Eva Jablonka of Tel Aviv University, Israel, who thinks evolution can occur via epigenetic changes and that we need a new evolutionary synthesis. \u201cMaybe there was genetic variation that contributed to the eye loss.\u201d Lamarckian evolution \nHowever, Jablonka thinks that heritable epigenetic changes alone could explain the loss of eyes. What is more, she even thinks it possible that the epigenetic changes were somehow triggered by the cave environment in the first place. That would be a form of Lamarckian evolution: the idea that characteristics acquired during an individual\u2019s lifetime can be passed on to descendants. \nDavid Shuker at the University of Edinburgh, UK, is unconvinced by this or any of the other proposed examples of evolution via epigenetic mechanisms. \nThere is no doubt that some animals respond to the environment via epigenetic mechanisms, he says, but these mechanisms have evolved via genetic changes. \u201cIt goes through genetically built systems,\u201d Shuker says. \nSo, like Futuyma, he thinks standard evolutionary processes such as mutation and natural selection still explain all we have discovered. \n\u201cWe are always finding new ways in which these processes manifest themselves,\u201d says Shuker. \u201cWe have found lots of amazing things.\u201d But the basic principles remain valid, he says. \nShuker is suspicious of some efforts to promote the idea of an \u201cextended evolutionary synthesis\u201d. He thinks some people are trying sneak religious ideas back into evolutionary theory. \n\u201cThey are trying to allow organisms to have agency not controlled by genes,\u201d he says.

It\u2019s an important step toward finally letting people take home supportive exosuits after injuries, rather than having to stay in hospital. \nRobotic exoskeletons are often used for rehabilitation: they do your walking for you. Typically, they do this using motors placed at the joints, which transmit forces to rigid components that move the wearer\u2019s legs. \nThere\u2019s just one problem: they can\u2019t turn. All they can do is walk you in a straight line. \u201cHelping people to turn is really important, yet has rarely been addressed,\u201d says Steve Collins at Stanford University in California. Advertisement \nNow, Stephen John at Panasonic Research in Japan and his colleagues have tackled the problem. Their design, made from snug-fitting soft robotics , looks a bit like Spanx with an outboard motor \u2013 a pack on the back contains eight motors, batteries and a control system. Instead of joint motors driving leg movement, it has four actuators at the hips to control criss-crossing soft plastic wires that mimic the action of human muscles, which contract to generate movement. \u201cOne of the unique aspects of this exosuit is the way the fabric is wrapped around the legs to allow different combinations of motors to turn a leg,\u201d says Collins. \nIn preliminary tests, five able-bodied people tried out the exosuit with their eyes closed and in each case the suit could change direction without them losing their balance. John plans to do larger tests with people with disabilities. \nThe ability to change direction while walking will be key for take-home exoskeletons. \u201cBeing able to turn is important for home use,\u201d says John. \nOnce people who have had a stroke, for example, have recovered enough function in the clinic, they could wear the suit to move more naturally at home. It could also be a boon for older people, allowing them to live independently. \u201cThey could put it on the morning and wear it all day,\u201d says John. \nThe next step is to make the suit easier for the user to control. John is working on a sensor system that will detect when a wearer makes a slight turning motion, and complete the motion for them. He is also working on a way for the suit to sit down and stand up. \u201cOur goal is to assist with all the important movements that people encounter in their daily lives,\u201d says John. \nThe system was presented last month at the IROS conference in Vancouver, Canada.

Hurt (SSC/Caltech) By Leah Crane \nWe\u2019re putting the far side of the galaxy on the map. The most precise measurement yet of an object on the far side of the galaxy\u2019s centre is paving the way for a definitive map of the other side of the Milky Way . \nIt\u2019s difficult to observe anything on that side of the galaxy because of the dense, frenetic swarm of dust and gas at its centre. Thomas Dame at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts and his colleagues got around this by looking at a jet of radio waves that can outshine any emissions coming from that mess of stars. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a very bright source, indicative of a flamboyant region of star formation, and these regions are almost always located in the spiral arms of the galaxy,\u201d says Dame. He and his team pinned down the source\u2019s location to the Scutum-Centaurus arm of the galaxy, probably one of the Milky Way\u2019s two major arms . Advertisement \nTo do this, they used parallax measurements, which take into account differences in measurements from two points in space. If you hold a finger up at arm\u2019s length and close one eye, then the other, your finger will appear to move over slightly \u2013 that small discrepancy is called parallax. The closer the object is to the observer, and the further apart the two observing locations, the larger the parallax. Building a better map \nThe object that Dame and his colleagues measured is so far away that to determine its parallax, they had to measure it over the course of a whole year, taking observations at either side of Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun. \n\u201cThese angles that are being measured are mind-boggling,\u201d says Dame. \u201cIn this case it\u2019s about 50 arcseconds, which is smaller than the size of Neil Armstrong\u2019s footprint on the moon viewed from Earth.\u201d \nThat tiny parallax angle corresponds to a distance of 66,500 light years. It\u2019s the furthest distance ever measured via parallax, and the first time it\u2019s been used for an object on the other side of the galaxy. \nSince much of our understanding of structure that part of the Milky Way comes from assumptions based on knowledge of the near side, parallax measurements may allow us to build a more accurate map of our entire galaxy . \n\u201cThe idea that you could be doing this for more objects on the far side of the galaxy is really exciting,\u201d says Robert Benjamin at the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater. \u201cHow can you talk about the structure of our galaxy when you only have half of it?\u201d \nDame says with this technique we could have an accurate and complete map of the entire Milky Way within 10 years.

So concludes an analysis of the genetic variants associated with skin pigmentation in people from several regions of Africa. The latest findings suggest that some particularly dark skin tones evolved relatively recently from paler genetic variants, underlining how deeply flawed the racist concept of people with whiter skin being \u201cmore advanced\u201d really is. \nNicholas Crawford and Sarah Tishkoff at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia recruited around 1500 ethnically and genetically diverse volunteers living in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Botswana for their study. Each person agreed to provide a DNA sample and have their skin pigmentation measured (pictured above). \nThe combined data allowed the team to find eight sites in the human genome that are particularly associated with the level of skin pigmentation. Together, these sites account for about 30 per cent of the variation they found in skin pigmentation among the volunteers. \nFor each of the eight sites of variation, there existed a genetic variant associated with paler skin, and a variant linked to darker skin. Seven of the paler skin variants emerged at least 270,000 years ago. Four of these arose more than 900,000 years ago. Plenty of variation \nThe latest thinking is that Homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago . The new findings mean that relatively pale skin tone variants predate the appearance of our species and have been retained in some parts of Africa ever since. \nThis might surprise some geneticists, says Tishkoff. Previous studies of a skin pigmentation gene called MC1R had led many geneticists to think that dark skin colour \u2013 which is thought to protect against UV damage \u2013 is a fixed and consistent trait in all people of African descent. \n\u201cThey thought [ MC1R ] shows that there has been selection for dark skin in Africa and therefore there\u2019s no variation,\u201d says Tishkoff. \nBut in retrospect, it\u2019s obvious that the story of skin pigmentation in sub-Saharan Africa is more complicated than that, as there is huge variation in skin colour across the continent today. The San hunter-gatherer populations of southern Africa often have lightly pigmented skin, and belong to one of the most ancient branches of the Homo sapiens family tree . \n\u201cI think the most interesting observation is that some ancestral light skin alleles are shared between the San and archaic hominins such as Neanderthals and Denisovans,\u201d says Carles Lalueza-Fox at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, Spain. \u201cThis suggests a shared, common ancestry for this trait before the split of these three hominin lineages.\u201d \nOf the darker-skin gene variants, three appear to have evolved from less pigmented variants. This means that some people with particularly dark skin \u2013 such as the Nilo-Saharan pastoralists of East Africa \u2013 gained the trait relatively recently, from paler-skinned ancestors. \u201cPeople have thought it was just light skin that has been evolving,\u201d says Tishkoff. \u201cI think dark skin continues to evolve as well.\u201d No single \u201cAfrican race\u201d \nResearch into the genetics of skin tone and other traits has a significance beyond understanding our species\u2019 evolutionary history. \u201cThere are racists who want to associate skin pigmentation with intellectual traits or traits dealing with moral behaviour,\u201d says Nina Jablonski at Pennsylvania State University. \nBut there is no justification for white supremacist arguments that people of European descent with typically paler skin are inherently superior or more evolved. \u201cWe see these variants associated with whiter skin actually came from Africa,\u201d says Tishkoff. \n\u201cThere is no homogeneous \u2018African race\u2019,\u201d says Tishkoff. In fact, recent surveys of the views of physical anthropologists suggest that most of them flatly reject the idea that humans can be divided into biological races at all.

Maintaining eyes and the visual parts of the brain uses lots of energy , so the loss of eyes is a big advantage for animals living in the dark. Instead the cavefish \u201csee\u201d by sucking . \nIt was assumed that these fish became blind because mutations disabled key genes involved in eye development. This has been shown to be the case for some other underground species that have lost their eyes. Advertisement \nBut Aniket Gore of the US\u2019s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and colleagues haven\u2019t found any disabling changes in the DNA sequences of eye development genes in the cavefish. \nInstead, the genes have been switched off by the addition of chemical tags called methyl groups. This is what is known as an epigenetic , rather than genetic, change. \n\u201cAlthough a central role for DNA methylation in development and disease has been well-documented, our results suggest that epigenetic processes can play an equally important role in adaptive evolution,\u201d the team writes. Faster evolution? \nThe researchers propose that this epigenetic mechanism allowed the cavefish to shed its eyes faster than if the change had happened via DNA mutations in eye genes. \nThat is a controversial suggestion, and one that will be music to the ears of those who think that evolution can occur via heritable epigenetic mechanisms, and that standard evolutionary theory needs to be broadened to include such processes . \n\u201cThis is a most interesting paper,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Douglas Futuyma of Stony Brook University in New York. But he doesn\u2019t think it poses any challenge to standard evolutionary theory as the epigenetic change is itself most likely a result of a genetic change. \nGore\u2019s team shows that the silencing of the eye genes is due to the increased activity of a specific gene involved in methylation, Futuyma points out. So the question then is, what is making this gene more active? \n\u201cI think it likely that there has been an alteration in DNA sequence of that gene,\u201d he says. \n\u201cYou cannot completely rule out genetic mutations,\u201d says Eva Jablonka of Tel Aviv University, Israel, who thinks evolution can occur via epigenetic changes and that we need a new evolutionary synthesis. \u201cMaybe there was genetic variation that contributed to the eye loss.\u201d Lamarckian evolution \nHowever, Jablonka thinks that heritable epigenetic changes alone could explain the loss of eyes. What is more, she even thinks it possible that the epigenetic changes were somehow triggered by the cave environment in the first place. That would be a form of Lamarckian evolution: the idea that characteristics acquired during an individual\u2019s lifetime can be passed on to descendants. \nDavid Shuker at the University of Edinburgh, UK, is unconvinced by this or any of the other proposed examples of evolution via epigenetic mechanisms. \nThere is no doubt that some animals respond to the environment via epigenetic mechanisms, he says, but these mechanisms have evolved via genetic changes. \u201cIt goes through genetically built systems,\u201d Shuker says. \nSo, like Futuyma, he thinks standard evolutionary processes such as mutation and natural selection still explain all we have discovered. \n\u201cWe are always finding new ways in which these processes manifest themselves,\u201d says Shuker. \u201cWe have found lots of amazing things.\u201d But the basic principles remain valid, he says. \nShuker is suspicious of some efforts to promote the idea of an \u201cextended evolutionary synthesis\u201d. He thinks some people are trying sneak religious ideas back into evolutionary theory. \n\u201cThey are trying to allow organisms to have agency not controlled by genes,\u201d he says.

For more than a century, it has been depicted as a sluggish, belly-dragging beast with sprawling legs \u2013 but it might actually have held its legs in a more upright position and kept its stomach off the ground as it walked. \nOften mistaken for a dinosaur, Dimetrodon actually belonged to a group called the pelycosaurs that were more closely related to mammals . It lived between about 290 and 272 million years ago , with some species measuring more than 3 metres from nose to tail. Its most iconic feature was a gigantic sail on its back, the function of which is still debated . \nNineteenth Century artists drew Dimetrodon as a sluggish-looking animal with legs sprawled out to each side of its body, resting its weight on an enormous belly \u2013 and even in the 21st century nothing much has changed. Advertisement \n\u201cI was baffled as I was going through the literature how little this had been questioned,\u201d says Caroline Abbott at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. It\u2019s particularly surprising given that the fossil trackways left by Dimetrodon seem to tell a different story. The relatively narrow distance between left and right sets of footprints suggest Dimetrodon did not have sprawling legs. \n\u201cThat\u2019s where the real head-scratcher is,\u201d says Abbott. \u201cThe trackways are more narrow than you\u2019d expect and in a lot of cases they lack belly dragging marks.\u201d Modern moves \nWith her colleague Hans-Dieter Sues at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, Abbott measured Dimetrodon bones, and looked at the configuration of the skeleton at the shoulder and the hip. She then compared this information with data collected from 11 living mammals \u2013 including the short-beaked echidna \u2013 and 12 living reptiles, including the Komodo dragon , the savannah monitor and the spectacled caiman. \nWhen Abbott and Sues used software to run their data, they found that Dimetrodon seemed to most closely match the caiman, a crocodilian that can hold its legs vertically enough to raise its body off the ground \u2013 particularly when it runs. Dimetrodon might have held its body in a similar way. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the best I have right now,\u201d says Abbott, who will present her findings at a meeting of the Geological Society of America in Seattle later this month. \u201cBut I\u2019m hoping that as I broaden the modern analogues I look at, and do more complicated stats, I can pinpoint that a bit better.\u201d Sprawling logic \nSpencer Lucas at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque agrees that Dimetrodon \u2019s posture needs a reassessment. He suggested as much in the late 1990s , after he and his colleague Adrian Hunt studied Dimetrodon trackways. \n\u201cWhen we wrote that paper we were just throwing the gauntlet down and saying: look, the trackways are showing something really different than anybody has thought from the skeletons,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t try to resolve it.\u201d \nHe says some palaeontologists did offer an explanation \u2013 that Dimetrodon thrashed its spine from side to side so much as it walked that it could leave narrow sets of footprints despite having sprawled legs. Abbott and Sues are suggesting a different solution, he says. \nLucas thinks the debate could be resolved by returning to the Dimetrodon trackways and using them to assess how fast the animals were moving. The \u201cthrashing spine\u201d idea assumes they were lumbering along slowly, whereas Abbott and Sues\u2019s reconstruction would be more consistent with an animal moving at speed \u2013 some crocodiles can run at more than 10 miles per hour. \n\u201cIf this is a pelycosaur moving quickly in a crocodilian-like fashion that would support [Abbott\u2019s] argument,\u201d says Lucas. \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T15:25:37.437+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2bb0e4c156237eccba9df2b275d40001c7849eef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX0pCEwBVHhdv5b31ZxwHkXYmoc9LY_mPIzwTBsouN1Zk1xcnW9Hzu3e27QFhLQ7pwKTSb1_893dVHy1aWNvTNoLk52N21T9zlA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/interviews", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Male chimpanzee seen snatching seconds-old chimp and eating it", "title_full": "Male chimpanzee seen snatching seconds-old chimp and eating it", "published": "2017-10-13T16:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/12175820/unknown-1.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5016, "comments": 0, "shares": 5016}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2bb0e4c156237eccba9df2b275d40001c7849eef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX0pCEwBVHhdv5b31ZxwHkXYmoc9LY_mPIzwTBsouN1Zk1xcnW9Hzu3e27QFhLQ7pwKTSb1_893dVHy1aWNvTNoLk52N21T9zlA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T16:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Male chimpanzee seen snatching seconds-old chimp and eating it", "text": "Male chimpanzee seen snatching seconds-old chimp and eating it Michio Nakamura By Jessica Hamzelou \nA rare sighting of a chimpanzee giving birth in the wild came to a grisly conclusion. Within seconds of the birth, the baby was snatched away and eaten by a male of the same group. The observation explains why female chimpanzees tend to go into hiding for weeks or months when they have their babies. \nLittle is known about how chimpanzees give birth in the wild because only five births have ever been observed, says Hitonaru Nishie of Kyoto University in Japan. Nishie and his colleagues have been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania\u2019s Mahale mountains for the last few years. Advertisement \nOne of the reasons so few have been witnessed is that the soon-to-be mothers often leave the group when the baby is due, and don\u2019t return until the infant is weeks or months old. This absence has been described as a chimpanzee\u2019s \u201cmaternity leave\u201d. \nSo Nishie and his colleague Michio Nakamura were surprised when, at around 11 am one December day, a female member of the chimpanzee group they were observing began to give birth in front of the 20 other members. \nAs soon as the baby was out \u2013 and before the mother had even had a chance to touch it \u2013 the baby was snatched away by a male member of the group, who then disappeared into the bush. The researchers found him around 1\u00bd hours later, sitting up a tree and eating the infant from the lower half of its body. He ate the entire body within an hour. Rare event \nThis is the first time anyone has reported seeing a newborn chimpanzee cannibalised in this way, says Nishie. He says that his observation provides an obvious clue as to why chimpanzee mothers tend to hide away to give birth. \nIn this case, the mother may not yet have had a chance to learn about \u201cmaternity leave\u201d if it was her first pregnancy, says Tatyana Humle at the University of Kent, UK. \u201cI would predict that she would go on \u2018maternity leave\u2019 next time,\u201d she says. \nIn fact, when the female chimp did subsequently have another baby (pictured above), she disappeared for a month. \nMale animals of many other species are known to kill young infants that aren\u2019t related to them. This allows them to mate with the mother, and to have more of their own offspring in the group. And female chimpanzees have also been spotted killing the infants of other females when resources like food are scarce, says Humle. \nThe baby chimp may simply have been a source of nutrition to the adult that snatched it, says Nishie. \nAt any rate, infanticide and cannabilism are extremely rare among chimpanzees, says Hulme. \u201cI work with a chimp community in West Africa, and I have never witnessed any cases,\u201d she says. Humle thinks that such violence may be more likely to occur in larger groups, where there is more competition for resources.

Good news, you may have the skills to work in cybersecurity . An online training platform launching next week in the UK \u2013 with the backing of Robert Hannigan, the former director of the country\u2019s GCHQ intelligence agency \u2013 is designed to make cybersecurity roles tempting to people, whatever their background. \nCyberattacks now bring organisations to their knees with worrying frequency. Earlier this year the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomwares shut down multiple organisations around the world. And in the last few weeks, details emerged of two of the biggest data hacks ever: the US credit reporting agency Equifax revealed that tens of millions of people\u2019s personal data had been stolen from it, and Yahoo admitted that a large hack in 2013 had compromised all of its 3 billion users\u2019 accounts. \nThere simply are not enough people with the skills to fend off such attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fill roles just from computer science students,\u201d says James Hadley, CEO of Immersive Labs, the UK company behind the new platform \u2013 the Digital Cyber Academy .

People from non-technical backgrounds could bring new perspectives to what is as much a people problem as a computer one. \nHadley, who used to be teach cybersecurity, thinks that students with a wider range of experience would inject fresh ideas. Anyone good at analysing a situation, troubleshooting and problem-solving \u2013 or simply with perseverance and curiosity \u2013 fits the bill, he says. \n\u201cA strong grasp of the technology is valuable, but it\u2019s by no means sufficient,\u201d says Andrew Martin, director of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security at the University of Oxford. \u201cDecades of vulnerabilities in popular software products tell us that good software engineers can screw things up quite badly.\u201d Jobs via a leaderboard \nMartin thinks the Digital Cyber Academy is a good idea. For now, the platform is aimed at UK students, who can sign up here . It will offer a range of training courses from complete beginner level to advanced. Scores for completing exercises will be posted to a leaderboard. Companies will then be able to invite candidates who have reached a certain level of competence to apply for roles. \nHadley says the platform will be constantly updated with the latest developments. For example, an existing training platform that Immersive Labs sells to firms for internal recruiting added an exercise about the NotPetya ransomware on the day it hit. \u201cPeople could read about it in the morning and get their hands dirty in the afternoon,\u201d says Hadley. \nUltimately, Immersive Labs hopes to address entrenched preconceptions about cybersecurity. When Equifax revealed in September that it had been the victim of an attack that exposed the names, addresses and social security numbers of nearly half the US population, critics pounced on the fact that its head of security had a music degree. \n\u201cThat was hugely frustrating,\u201d says Hadley. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to remove these misconceptions.\u201d He says that music has formal patterns and logic that align quite well with cybersecurity. \u201cMany in cybersecurity are self-taught,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to encourage that behaviour.\u201d \nMartin agrees. \u201cMany cybersecurity issues arise from the realities of human nature or the way we organise society,\u201d he says. Fixing them requires a diverse set of skills. \u201cThe ideal security director is a polymath.\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert hannigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james hadley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hadley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yahoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital cyber academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centre for doctoral training", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gchq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "immersive labs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T18:17:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1cdf50d993d8d63417ce7de409ade12ae134338", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXzuGF2CeLmJxO9271TaXxjNr8z6Yo8Qk5aCnWCPX3yX.Wed2Z1MUkpVDq.PY7gG6BZpUShmmzMedyL6dAuJGDrR_SdCo_BJhqQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/sport", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Sperm age calculator tells men how decrepit their sperm are", "title_full": "Sperm age calculator tells men how decrepit their sperm are", "published": "2017-10-13T18:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13153540/p6240100-coloured_sem_of_human_spermatozoa.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 976, "comments": 0, "shares": 976}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1cdf50d993d8d63417ce7de409ade12ae134338", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXzuGF2CeLmJxO9271TaXxjNr8z6Yo8Qk5aCnWCPX3yX.Wed2Z1MUkpVDq.PY7gG6BZpUShmmzMedyL6dAuJGDrR_SdCo_BJhqQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T18:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sperm age calculator tells men how decrepit their sperm are", "text": "13 October 2017, updated 16 October 2017 Sperm age calculator tells men how decrepit their sperm are Sometimes age does matter Juergen Berger/SPL By Jessica Hamzelou \nA sperm age calculator can tell men how \u201cold\u201d their sperm are, using clues from DNA analysis, and has revealed some of the effects of smoking on sperm. \nWhile a woman\u2019s age has long been known to affect the health of her offspring, we have only recently begun to understand how a father\u2019s age can have similar effects. Older fathers are now known to pass on more genetic mutations to their children than older mothers do. And children of older fathers are more likely to have autism and schizophrenia . \n\u201cThe hope is that we could potentially screen people and say, \u2018your sperm is really old\u2019, and identify risks for the offspring,\u201d says Tim Jenkins at the University of Utah. Advertisement \nGrowing evidence suggests that older dads might pass on health risks through epigenetic tags on the DNA in their sperm. These tags alter how active genes are, and lifestyle factors such as diet and smoking are known to make epigenetic changes that may affect the next generation . Read more \u2013 Testicular time bomb: Older dads\u2019 mutant sperm \nAgeing is also a factor. Jenkins and his colleagues have studied the sperm of 350 men, looking for these genetic switches. So far, the team have found changes at 147 points in the genome that seem to be linked to a man\u2019s age. \nUsing this information, the team have created a \u201ccalculator\u201d that assesses the state of the DNA of a man\u2019s sperm at these 147 sites. Their analysis can predict a man\u2019s age with approximately 95 per cent accuracy, and identify whether a man\u2019s sperm have aged prematurely. \nJenkins and his colleagues have found that smokers have much older-looking sperm. \u201cFor a 40-year-old man who smokes, our calculator would calculate him to be 44 or so,\u201d says Jenkins, who will present his findings at the end of the month at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting in San Antonio, Texas. \nThe researchers don\u2019t yet know if these changes are responsible for the increased risks of autism and schizophrenia in the children of older men, but Michael Carroll at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK, suspects this is the case. \n\u201cThe emphasis on smoking has always been on the mother\u2019s side,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cBut it\u2019s becoming more evident that exposures in men can alter health. It\u2019s not just about how sperm swim or what they look like \u2013 there are changes at the molecular level which can affect the offspring.\u201d \nBecause sperm is produced throughout a man\u2019s life, there\u2019s a chance that men with old sperm might be able to reverse some of the damage, says Carroll. \n\u201cIf you have a male in his 30s or 40s who has a sperm age in the 50s or 60s, you\u2019d have to look at why that is,\u201d says Carroll. \u201cIf you could change those factors, you could possibly reverse the clock.\u201d Article amended on 16 October 2017 \nWe corrected the accuracy of the analysis \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "juergen berger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tim jenkins   utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carroll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica hamzelou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael carroll", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "american society of reproductive medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester metropolitan university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san antonio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T18:57:14.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b436917e8ad508b4a62f9eb5768476b71085ca24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX.gOU2tEh3Lf7hZYtjUqrtXFxCGonavdsuihT8.oL7Ii8DxMDwM8w14wxKESvyZc4Mj6K7IPGFJ0qabRdMa11GzFbJK1OTez8Q--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/cancer", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Magic mushroom extract changes brains of people with depression", "title_full": "Magic mushroom extract changes brains of people with depression", "published": "2017-10-13T18:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13155252/rexfeatures_2284965a.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 9630, "comments": 0, "shares": 9630}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 21}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b436917e8ad508b4a62f9eb5768476b71085ca24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX.gOU2tEh3Lf7hZYtjUqrtXFxCGonavdsuihT8.oL7Ii8DxMDwM8w14wxKESvyZc4Mj6K7IPGFJ0qabRdMa11GzFbJK1OTez8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T18:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Magic mushroom extract changes brains of people with depression", "text": "Magic mushroom extract changes brains of people with depression Self-medication isn\u2019t recommended Photofusion/REX/Shutterstock By New Scientist staff and Press Association \nPsilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound found in magic mushrooms , may help re-set the activity of neural circuits in the brain that are involved in depression. \nMagic mushroom enthusiasts have long believed that the drug\u2019s ability to induce profound-feeling experiences could be therapeutically useful. Brain-imaging studies have shown that psilocybin targets areas of the brain overactive in depression. \nLast year, Robin Carhart-Harris of Imperial College London and his colleagues conducted the first clinical trial of using psilocybin to treat depression , and got some encouraging results. The trial only involved 12 people and no control group, but the team found that after two sessions of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, all of the volunteers had reduced symptoms.

The study involved 19 people who had depression that had not been helped by conventional treatments. Mood reset \nEach volunteer was given a 10 mg and 25 mg dose of psilocybin, seven days apart. Brain scans showed that, after taking the drug, activity in some regions of the brain reduced. These areas included the amygdala, which plays a role in processing stress and fear. The participants reported an immediate improvement in mood that lasted for up to five weeks. \n\u201cWe have shown for the first time clear changes in brain activity in depressed people treated with psilocybin after failing to respond to conventional treatments,\u201d says Carhart-Harris. \u201cSeveral of our patients described feeling \u2018reset\u2019 after the treatment.\u201d \n\u201cThis is further evidence that psilocybin may turn out to be effective for the most stubborn depression,\u201d says Paul Morrison , of King\u2019s College London. \u201cDevelopments in this area are a priority in psychiatry.

An \u201cethical knob\u201d could let the owners of self-driving cars choose their car\u2019s ethical setting. You could set the car to sacrifice you for the survival of others, or even to always sacrifice others to save you. \nThe dilemma of how self-driving cars should tackle moral decisions is one of the major problems facing manufacturers. When humans drive cars, instinct governs our reaction to danger. When fatal crashes occur, it is usually clear who is responsible. \nBut if cars are to drive themselves, they cannot rely on instinct, they must rely on code. And when the worst happens will it be the software engineers, the manufacturers or the car owner who is ultimately responsible? Advertisement \nPeople\u2019s attitudes to the issue are also complicated. A 2015 study found that most people think a driverless car should be utilitarian , taking actions to minimise the amount of overall harm, which might mean sacrificing its own passengers in certain situations. But while people agreed to this in principle, they also said they would never get in a car that was prepared to kill them. Go \u201cfull altruist\u201d \n\u201cWe wanted to explore what would happen if the control and the responsibility for a car\u2019s actions were given back to the driver,\u201d says Guiseppe Contissa at the University of Bologna in Italy, who along with his colleagues has come up with a solution. \nThe team have designed a dial that will switch a car\u2019s setting from \u201cfull altruist\u201d to \u201cfull egoist\u201d, with the middle setting being impartial. They think their ethical knob would work not only for self-driving cars, but for all areas of industry that are becoming increasingly autonomous. \n\u201cThe knob tells an autonomous car the value that the driver gives to his or her life relative to the lives of others,\u201d says Contissa. \u201cThe car would use this information to calculate the actions it will execute, taking in to account the probability that the passengers or other parties suffer harm as a consequence of the car\u2019s decision.\u201d Me, me, me \nBut there are issues with the idea. \u201cIf people have too much control over the relative risks the car makes, we could have a Tragedy of the Commons type scenario, in which everyone chooses the maximal self-protective mode,\u201d says Edmond Awad of the MIT Media Lab, lead researcher on the Moral Machine project there. \nAnother concern is that people may be unwilling to take on moral responsibility.

Flore-Ael Surun/Tendance Floue By Shaoni Bhattacharya \nWELCOME to the neontocracy: a world that revolves around the needs of children far beyond the basics of food and material comfort. Here, it is considered vital to maintain children\u2019s happiness, status, self-esteem and protection, and for parents to do their own childcare and schedule life-enhancing activities for their kids, providing constant stimulation. \nThe neontocracy is increasingly the ideal for the WEIRD world of Western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic societies. For anthropologist David Lancy of Utah State University (who coined the term neontocracy), this aim is an outlier that bucks the historical and ethnographic record, and in Raising Children , he picks apart the good and bad in WEIRD parenting. \nAbandoning harsh practices (sending the kids into the forest in hard times, or enslaving them) is surely good, but progressive virtues carry their own risks. The new ways, says Lancy, can leave many as kidults, ill-prepared to enter a complicated, adult world. They can even feed rising levels of mental illness, stress and suicide. \u201cNew ways of child-rearing can leave many as kidults, ill-prepared to enter a complicated, adult world\u201d \nWhile Lancy is clear that he is an anthropologist, not a peddler of childcare manuals, readers who are parents will still feel uncomfortably nudged. Another book, Lifelong Kindergarten by Mitchel Resnick, also offers parents similar fodder. Luckily, both books draw on more than psychology or neurology. Lancy\u2019s book is based on decades of anthropological research, while Resnick, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, concentrates on the relationship between kids and coding. \nIn some ways, both writers offer relief to hard-working WEIRD parents, exhausted by catering for their offspring in the high-maintenance regimes demanded both by current parenting movements and by ever-more prescriptive, anxious societies. Newer research seems to back the idea that parenting doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Both Lancy and Resnick cite developmental psychologist and writer Alison Gopnik, whose 2016 book The Gardener and the Carpenter shares similar insights. \nBut Lancy\u2019s book in particular delivers a cultural context that Gopnik\u2019s book lacked. And while Gopnik gently challenged Western parents, Lancy will have them choking on their lattes. Take one cornerstone of child development, attachment parenting. A strong emotional and physical attachment to at least one primary caregiver (parent, aunt, adopter and so on) is said to be crucial. Yet for most of history, and across all cultures to varying extents, the emphasis was for the mother not to get too emotionally invested in a newborn or young infant who might die or sap her energy and health, and consequently the well-being of the family or community. \nIn many cultures, found Lancy, it could not be taken for granted that a baby would be considered a person. The idea of delayed personhood is, in fact, common. Among the Sikkimese Lepcha people, a baby is considered as being still in the uterus for three days after birth and referred to as a \u201crat-child\u201d rather than human, while the Punan Bah see a child as little more than a body while its soul gradually takes residence, making it human. \nAnd we should recall that centuries ago, high infant mortality gave Western societies a more utilitarian view of the cost-benefit of children. Lancy cites a 6th-century Frankish law which decreed that the fine for killing a young woman of childbearing age was 600 sous, compared with just 60 sous for a male baby and a mere 30 for a female one. \nLancy\u2019s point is that modern practices \u2013 such as co-sleeping, on-demand feeding and constant parent-child play \u2013 now associated with attachment parenting should serve both parties or be abandoned. \u201cWe must not let the pendulum swing so far that other family members, or even the very fabric of family life, must suffer to stave off the dubious threat of reactive attachment disorder,\u201d he cautions. \nLancy also dismantles another aspect of the neontocracy: the way the West hails the uniqueness of every child. That, alongside an \u201ceveryone\u2019s-a-winner\u201d mentality, says Lancy, is doing children, society and the economy no good. Obsessed with children\u2019s happiness, US parents, \u201ctolerate mediocre academic performance and rail against teachers who expose our children\u2019s failings\u201d. In Connecticut, he says, teachers are banned from marking pupils\u2019 work with red ink to avoid damaging their self-esteem. \nWhile parenting styles promoting achievement and compliance with social or family rules, like that of the \u201cTiger mother\u201d , are met with a backlash, Lancy notes there is no evidence that high-achieving children are at particular risk of harm. But this doesn\u2019t mean we need more schooling or formal education. As Lancy says, our forebears thought learning through observation, play and autonomy were critical. \nCultures such as the nomadic Maniq hunter-gatherers of Thailand and Amazonian Matsigenka and Parakan\u00e3 still encourage children to practise using tools, knives and machetes. In our quest to shield children from harm, we may be undermining their natural inclination to learn adult survival skills, social and practical, and so extending childhood and \u201cfailure-to-launch\u201d. \nHappily, Lancy\u2019s research is so thorough and his writing infused with such gentle humour that even his admonishments and one-liners to parents are a pleasure. For example, advocating \u201cbenign neglect\u201d in parenting, he urges: \u201cGo ahead; try it. They\u2019ll thank you later on.\u201d \nThis is a fascinating book and, unusually for an academic work, my only criticism is that it was not long enough. There is so much more to know, particularly on the consequences of WEIRD societies\u2019 penchant for history-bucking parenting, with Lancy as a trustworthy, readable authority. \nLifelong Kindergarten takes its title from the research group Resnick heads at MIT\u2019s Media Lab. It promises so much: to shed light on how children and adults can be creative throughout life by learning from the ethos and practices of the kindergarten. \nLancy\u2019s basic assertion \u2013 how to harness kids\u2019 passions through collaborative projects and play \u2013 is clear in its implications for creativity. Many of his examples draw on the interactions of children in online communities exploring what they can do with the programming language Scratch. \nLike Lancy, Resnick highlights the shortcomings of the formal classroom. But while the book is insightful, it feels limited by focusing so much on the MIT group\u2019s work, and on Scratch and its online communities. \nResnick does allude to Gopnik, Piaget and stalwarts of creative play like the Denmark-based LEGO Group and even the woes of the Singaporean government in nurturing creativity in its high-achieving students. But a still wider perspective is needed. \u201cIn Connecticut, teachers are banned from marking work with red ink to avoid damaging self-esteem\u201d Childhood should be seen in cultural context Jonas Bendiksen/Magnum Photos \nIn one section, Resnick explores dichotomies in teaching and learning styles: between the idea that adult intervention should be formal, and a more hands-off approach. For him, children need balance between freedom and structure to optimise their creativity. And then there is the Silicon Valley idea of \u201cplaypen versus playground\u201d. \nWhile some computer games are like playpens, requiring children to advance through levels, others inspire creativity through virtual playgrounds. In Minecraft , for example, children can build their own structures and games, not unlike playing with physical Lego bricks. \nPlay \u2013 and the freedoms it unlocks \u2013 are key to Resnick and Lancy. For the good of all and for maximum creativity, it is time to unwrap the seedlings from the cotton wool in which we have enwrapped them, plant them in rich soil and make sure they don\u2019t grow up into another generation of overprotected kids.

My reflection, playing on the surface of an untitled sculpture of glass and curved mirrors the locals call \u201cthe shower cabinet\u201d, is pressed like a flower between mountain ranges. \nThis was the earliest of 33 pieces by 33 artists from 18 countries which, under the rubric of Artscape Nordland, were installed across Norway\u2019s Lofoten archipelago in the 1990s. The only tourists then were climbers. Today the archipelago\u2019s 23,000 residents host around a million visitors a year, and its biennial, the Lofoten International Art Festival (LIAF), attracts international artists and curators. Advertisement \nI was invited to join them on Coast Contemporary, a combined conference, arts festival and royal progress, by ship, down Norway\u2019s coast. Our first port of call was LIAF itself, based this year in the once bustling fishing town of Henningsvaer. \nA lot of LIAF\u2019s work is specially commissioned; the hope is that visiting artists, confronting this delicate, temperate and fertile environment, will find something fresh and pertinent to say about our relationship with our planet. The pressure is intense: national elections in September have once again raised the spectre of oil drilling in what has been Norway\u2019s most protected natural region. The oilfield is estimated to be worth around $60 billion. \nSome artists responded to this prospect, and associated themes such as resource depletion and species extinction, with hippyish dismay. Egle Budvytyte\u2019s Liquid Power Has no Shame (pictured) sees three dancers pulsing with obscene sexlessness along a rocky foreshore, then gathering at a pool to welcome \u201cthe octopus\u201d with their own spit. Other artists, drunk on anthropology, use political and scientific data to render the entire modern era contemptible. Ho Tzu Nyen\u2019s The Critical Dictionary of Southeast Asia, vol. 3, which even includes irrigation in its catalogue of political missteps, is not for the faint-hearted. \nAnd do you remember Donna Haraway? The cultural critic made her name in the 1970s by showing how our ideas of the natural world are always constructed by a group of people at a particular place and time. Fabrizio Terranova\u2019s film Donna Haraway: Story telling for earthly survival (pictured) shows her despairing now of her fellow intellectuals, \u201cmesmerised by the smartness of the latest analysis of capital\u201d. \u201cArtists are engaging with the natural world through \u2018multispecies storytelling and empathy\u2019\u201d \nA couple of days later, we are in Trondheim. At the Kunsthall, a group show, The New We, has artists engaging with the natural world through \u201cmultispecies storytelling and empathy\u201d. Kjell Ove Storvik \n\\There is plenty of overthinking here, too. Rachel Mayeri\u2019s Primate Cinema: Apes as family is an 11-minute TV show for chimps, made with primatologists from Edinburgh Zoo in the UK. Watching the tape of chimps reacting to it should enlighten, and if you\u2019re a primatologist, it probably does. For the rest of us, what\u2019s noticeable is how unhuman their responses are. \nThe exhibition\u2019s organisers say they are \u201cwary of [their] own authority as truth-producing curators\u201d. Why? Is that not their job? Aren\u2019t the arguments that might ensue the entire point of visiting a gallery in the first place? As the days and the conversations pass, I find myself siding more and more with what Haraway so memorably called \u201cthe paralysis of critique\u201d. \nOn the pillars supporting the Kunsthall roof, Asjorn Skou has drawn simple, artful, pencil images of our Anthropocene future. For all their science fiction content, SporeSpore depicts people engaging as best they can with an un-ignorably non-human environment. \nPainful as it is to engage directly with that during a mass extinction (horrifying as it may be, for instance, to enter Krista Caballero and Frank Ekeberg\u2019s Birding the Future to listen to songs of vanished birds), such engagement is vital to our well-being, never mind Earth\u2019s. The true artist hides neither behind a capacity for sentiment, nor behind the exact sciences.

Maybe a new environmental campaign with a message of hope is just what we need Are things looking up? Roland Seitre/naturepl.com \nFIFTY-FIVE years ago last month, Rachel Carson published her seminal book Silent Spring . Its warning that indiscriminate use of pesticides was poisoning the planet is frequently credited with having started the modern environmental movement. \nWhat has that movement achieved? Arguably not much. Certainly not enough. Pesticides still abound, we\u2019re in the midst of a human-made mass extinction and decades of warnings about irreversible climate change appear to have fallen on deaf ears. \nBut amid the doom there have been some accomplishments. Emphasising those is the aim of a new environmental campaign that calls itself Earth optimism. Its proponents point out successes in protecting individual species like the scimitar oryx (above) and the Togo slippery frog, a decline in deforestation rates in the Amazon , the gradual transformation of our energy system and more (see \u201c Is positive thinking the way to save the planet? \u201c). The overall message is an Obama-esque \u201cYes we can!\u201d Advertisement \nThe movement is open to accusations of wearing rose-tinted spectacles, cherry-picking success stories and making mountains out of molehills. Saving the Togo slippery frog is an achievement, but in the grand scheme of things it hardly registers. But the Earth optimists\u2019 aim is not to claim that all is well. Rather, they point out that we cannot expect people to rise to the challenge without concrete examples of success. \nThey have a point. Despite having their hearts and heads in the right place, environmental campaigners all too often come across as doom-mongering, guilt-tripping party poopers. We need a new message. Whether Earth optimism is it remains to be seen, but it is an interesting experiment in shifting the narrative. A journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step.

If an enormous solar flare like the one that hit Earth 150 years ago struck us today, it could knock out our electrical grids, satellite communications and the internet. A new study finds that such an event is likely within the next century. \n\u201cThe sun is usually thought of as a friend and the source of life, but it could also be the opposite,\u201d says Avi Loeb at Harvard University. \u201cIt just depends on circumstances.\u201d \nLoeb and Manasvi Lingam , also at Harvard, examined data on other sun-like stars to see how likely solar \u201csuperflares\u201d are and how they might affect us. Advertisement Read more: Our galaxy\u2019s impossible collision could break gravity \nThey found that the most extreme superflares are likely to occur on a star like our sun about every 20 million years. The worst of these energetic bursts of ultraviolet radiation and high-energy charged particles could destroy our ozone layer, cause DNA mutations and disrupt ecosystems. \nBut in the shorter term, the researchers say that less intense superflares of a type we know can happen on our sun could still cause problems. In 1859, a powerful solar storm sent enormous flares towards Earth in the first recorded event of its kind. Telegraph systems across the Western world failed, with some reports of operators receiving shocks from the huge amounts of electrical current forced through the wires. Tech wipeout \n\u201cBack then, there was not very much technology so the damage was not very significant, but if it happened in the modern world, the damage could be trillions of dollars,\u201d says Loeb. \u201cA flare like that today could shut down all the power grids, all the computers, all the cooling systems on nuclear reactors. A lot of things could go bad.\u201d \nLoeb says an event as powerful as the 1859 one could cause about $10 trillion of damage to power grids, satellites and communications. A flare just a bit stronger could even damage the ozone layer. \nPrevious work has shown that such an event seems likely to occur in the next century, with a 12 per cent chance of it happening in the next decade, but nobody seems to be all that worried, Loeb says. Asteroid impacts get all the attention when it comes to life-threatening space events, but Loeb and Lingam found that superflares would be just as deadly and are just as likely. \n\u201cI\u2019m not lying awake in bed at night worrying about solar superflares, but that doesn\u2019t mean that someone shouldn\u2019t be worrying about it,\u201d says Greg Laughlin at Yale University. \nLast month, Loeb and Lingam came up with one potential way to protect Earth from superflares both large and small: an enormous loop of conductive wire between us and the sun that could act as a magnetic shield and deflect flares\u2019 particles away. \nUnfortunately, launching such a shield into space would cost upwards of $100 billion. \u201cI think that seriously diverting resources to build a wire loop in space would not be the best way to spend money,\u201d says Laughlin. \u201cBut thinking more about how solar superflares work and getting a sense of how our sun fits in with its peers would be a very valuable effort.\u201d Journal reference: The Astrophysical Journal , DOI: 10.3847/1538-4357/aa8e96 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leah crane", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "avi loeb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg laughlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "loeb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laughlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manasvi lingam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "harvard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T13:54:12.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ecdb11fddca53759d97989cb36a156273821533", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX9phxxk3bJgsLFExs_BonPNKnd15d1rf_7Q4IBmJi3rUJ4wDXxuNA5PetFxsinIxoIICb2L3zAcCkOQspMEu6mazSGERrtmq2Q--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "How to beat the bookies by turning their odds against them", "title_full": "How to beat the bookies by turning their odds against them", "published": "2017-10-16T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/16101636/gettyimages-485177480.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 86, "comments": 0, "shares": 86}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ecdb11fddca53759d97989cb36a156273821533", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX9phxxk3bJgsLFExs_BonPNKnd15d1rf_7Q4IBmJi3rUJ4wDXxuNA5PetFxsinIxoIICb2L3zAcCkOQspMEu6mazSGERrtmq2Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-16T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to beat the bookies by turning their odds against them", "text": "16 October 2017 How to beat the bookies by turning their odds against them The bookies collectively know best \u2013 so you use their odds to guide bets, so the claim goes Matthew Lloyd/Bloomberg via Getty Images By Chris Baraniuk \nFancy a flutter? The chances of making a profit by betting on football matches are extremely low, but a trio of researchers has managed to beat the odds with a simple formula. \nMathematicians had already developed bookie-beating models that attempt to predict the outcome of sports matches, but they are difficult to devise and don\u2019t always perform consistently. Lisandro Kaunitz at the University of Tokyo and his colleagues wanted to know if a more direct approach would work: using the bookmakers\u2019 own odds against them. \nThe team studied 10 years\u2019 worth of data on nearly half a million football matches and the associated odds offered by 32 bookmakers between January 2005 and June 2015. For every game, they looked for odds that might yield a better return than the average offered by bookies \u2013 say, 5 to 1 versus a mean of 2 to 1. Advertisement \n\u201cUsing the odds that are published, you can get a very good estimate of an event occurring,\u201d says team member Javier Kreiner, a data scientist at transport start-up CargoX in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. \u201cWhat\u2019s the probability of Barcelona winning against Real Madrid, for example.\u201d \nMean odds of 2 to 1 suggest the bookies collectively think this reflects fair odds for that outcome . But 5 to 1 offers higher returns should the outcome materialise. The team used the historical data to work out the optimal distance from the mean odds \u2013 the one that would give a positive payout for the largest number of games. \nWhen they applied their strategy in a simulation, they made a return of 3.5 per cent. Making bets randomly resulted in a loss of 3.32 per cent. Into real time \nThen the team decided to try betting for real. They developed an online tool that would apply their odds-averaging formula to upcoming football matches. When a favourable opportunity arose, a member of the team would email Kaunitz and his wife, one of whom then placed a bet. They kept this up for five months, placing $50 bets around 30 times a week. \nAnd they were winning. After five months the team had made a profit of $957.50 \u2013 a return of 8.5 per cent. There were some administrative costs, such as the expense of running servers to keep track of the odds in real time. But Kaunitz and his wife did get to splash out on a nice dinner in Tokyo, he says. \u201cWe were excited but it\u2019s worth mentioning \u2013 you need to spend a lot of time to do it.\u201d \nBut their streak was cut short. Following a series of several small wins, the trio were surprised to find that their accounts had been limited, restricting how much they could bet to as little as $1.25. \nA spokesman for William Hill, one of the bookmakers used by the team, said betting is sometimes restricted \u201cin a small number of cases\u201d. \n\u201cThis can be for a number of reasons, including bonus abuse and taking proportionately more than their fair share of special offers and enhanced prices, which are designed for the many rather than a few,\u201d he says. \nThe gambling industry has long restricted players who appear to show an edge over the house, says Mark Griffiths at Nottingham Trent University, UK. A classic example is card-counting , which can help players win at blackjack. Casinos are quick to expel those who try it and it is sometimes flagged as cheating. But it\u2019s not illegal in the US or the UK. Trapping bots \nGriffiths compares the team\u2019s approach to card-counting. \u201cIt\u2019s not cheating at all \u2013 it\u2019s using mathematics to try and beat a particular system,\u201d he says. \nOnline bookmakers have very tight profit margins, so some offer generous odds for very short periods of time on certain matches to lure automated or expert betting systems out into the open, says economist David Forrest at the University of Liverpool, UK. \u201cThey will try to trap the robots,\u201d he says. \u201cAnyone who responds has their account closed.\u201d \nSome of the researchers\u2019 accounts may have fallen foul of this system. In some cases they found they could not bet at all after signing up with certain bookies. If so, then this suggests their technique really was finding the best odds out there. But the house still always wins in the end.

Simonnet By Leah Crane \nFirst came the gravitational waves. Then, a burst of gamma radiation. As night fell in Chile, a small telescope had pinpointed the signals in the sky: the first ever neutron star smash-up found with gravitational waves. \nHours after the first signal in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detector in Hanford, Washington, on 17 August, about 70 telescopes and observatories across the planet and in space turned in concert to face the same spot in the constellation Hydra. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question that this is the most observed astronomical event ever. It\u2019s a thrilling notion, and a little overwhelming,\u201d says LIGO spokesperson David Shoemaker . \u201cWe\u2019ve got somewhere between a quarter and a third of all the world\u2019s astronomers working with us.\u201d Advertisement \nIt marks the first gravitational waves from something other than a black hole binary, the first proof that neutron star mergers can cause gamma ray bursts, the first sighting of heavy elements being formed and the first measurement of the universe\u2019s expansion using gravitational waves. \nSince it first started listening for disturbances in space-time, LIGO has heard five signals from gravitational waves created as pairs of black holes merged and sent ripples throughout the universe, but none from any other cosmic characters. \n\u201cWe\u2019d always thought that we would see binary neutron stars first and we finally did [see them], and it was every bit as spectacular as we hoped,\u201d says Nelson Christensen at Carleton College in Minnesota. \nThe new Virgo detector in Italy didn\u2019t directly see the gravitational waves because they were in its blind spot. But that helped pinpoint its location to an area small enough to search with optical telescopes. \u201cIt was like a dart game,\u201d says Christensen. \u201cWe just kept narrowing it down and then we finally got a bullseye with the optical detection.\u201d \nThe smash-up was seen in wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma rays. It is the first time an event has been observed in both gravitational waves and light. \nThe gravitational waves give us an idea of the inner workings of the collision, while the images in different wavelengths of light, including pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope, show us the resulting cloud of hot plasma and gas, and let us pin down the location. Standard siren \nBecause neutron stars are much smaller than black holes \u2013 in this case, each was less than twice the mass of the sun \u2013 they need to be far closer for us to see the ripples they create in space-time as they merge. This pair were only about 130 million light years away, more than 10 times closer than the next-nearest gravitational wave source we have seen. \nThe waves produced in this cosmic collision also revealed the speed at which the universe is expanding. Normally, this is calculated by measuring how fast supernovae or stars with well-known luminosity \u2013 called standard candles \u2013 are moving away from us. Instead, LIGO used gravitational waves, confirming previous calculations of this speed. We have visual: the neutron star collision 1M2H/UC Santa Cruz and Carnegie Observatories/Ryan Foley \n\u201cUsually we measure the expansion of the universe with standard candles and now we have a standard siren,\u201d says LIGO deputy spokesperson Laura Cadonati . \nBased on gravitational waves alone, we can\u2019t tell for sure what type of objects are sending waves our way \u2013 LIGO can only tell their size and velocity. These two objects were between one and two times the mass of the sun, so they could have been either neutron stars or small black holes. \nBut observations in all of the wavelengths prove that they are indeed neutron stars. \n\u201cThe collision spews out material from the surfaces of the objects, which cannot happen if one or both of them do not have a surface \u2013 and black holes don\u2019t have a surface, they have an event horizon,\u201d says Edo Berger at Harvard University. Heavy elements seen forming \n\u201cIt\u2019s this 11-billion-year-long dance of these objects orbiting around each other, and then at the moment of collision all hell breaks loose,\u201d Berger says. \nIn the explosion, called a kilonova, astronomers saw signs for the first time of heavy elements being formed as neutrons spewed out of the merging stars and hit lighter atoms nearby. \n\u201cPeople have long suspected that heavy elements were made in neutron star mergers, but this is really the first time we\u2019ve nailed that down,\u201d says Andrew Levan at the University of Warwick, UK. This merger made something like the mass of the Earth in gold, he says, along with other heavy elements such as platinum, lead and uranium. \nWhat is left behind after the collision remains shrouded in a cloud of heavy elements and mystery. Once the two stars smashed together, they may have formed a larger neutron star or collapsed into a black hole. \nBerger says many of the astronomers involved in the discovery think the collision resulted in a black hole, and that the gamma ray burst that occurred just afterwards was powered by matter being sucked into it. However, there is no way yet to know for sure. \nBut we now know we have been witnessing neutron star mergers for years \u2013 for as long as we\u2019ve been observing short gamma ray bursts \u2013 without knowing it. The explosion of gamma radiation that resulted as the latest pair of neutron stars first touched is the closest we have ever seen, and it is similar to a few others from further across the universe.

The cyclone, now downgraded to an extratropical storm, has reportedly led to three deaths . \nIt is unusual for a hurricane to reach western Europe while still at or near hurricane strength. The last comparable event was Hurricane Gordon in 2006, which had also weakened to a storm before it struck. \n\u201cThe historical record only shows one hurricane reaching Ireland whilst still at hurricane strength: Debbie in 1961,\u201d said Julian Heming of the UK Met Office. But in that case the data are sparse. \u201cIt is possible that, like Ophelia, Debbie transformed into an \u2018extratropical cyclone\u2019 some hours before it struck Ireland.\u201d Advertisement \nHowever, hurricanes could be a big part of Britain and Europe\u2019s future. \n\u201cThere is evidence that hurricane-force storms hitting the UK, like Ophelia, will be enhanced in the future due to human-induced climate change,\u201d said Dann Mitchell at the University of Bristol, UK. Stormy weather \nHurricanes form in the equatorial Atlantic, where the sea surface is warm enough to power them. Normally they head north-west towards North America, but some veer north-east and are carried to Europe by the jet stream . However, such a storm must first travel over cold north Atlantic waters, which saps its energy \u2013 so when it reaches Europe it is just a typical storm. \nBut that might not be how things play out in a warmer world, says Reindert Haarsma of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt. \nIn a 2013 study he simulated the tracks of Atlantic hurricanes in the last decade of this century. Haarsma found that in this warmer world, hurricanes could form further east , because the sea there was now warm enough to support them. This meant many of the storms bypassed America entirely and instead struck Europe ( Geophysical Research Letters , doi.org/kv2 ). \nThis conclusion has since been supported by a second group ( Journal of Climate , doi.org/f96cf5 ). Powerful winds \nIn a follow-up published in 2015, Haarsma and his colleagues used higher-resolution models to show that ex-hurricanes could re-intensify as they approached Europe, even reaching hurricane status ( Climate Dynamics , doi.org/f7hc2m ). \nThat was because they were \u201chybrid storms\u201d, a cross between a tropical hurricane and a northerly winter storm. These storms can be very powerful because they have two sources of energy. \nThey form as hurricanes, which are powered by heat. \u201cOver warm sea water, water evaporates then condenses, and the heat released from condensation is transformed into kinetic energy and that\u2019s the source of the hurricane,\u201d says Haarsma. Some of this warm, moist air remains caught in the centre of the storm, supplying energy. \nBut when storms form in the north, they have a different power source. \u201cThe energy comes from the horizontal temperature difference between the north and south part of the storm,\u201d says Haarsma. This is called \u201cbaroclinic instability\u201d. \nAn ex-hurricane can sometimes keep its warm core even as it becomes an extratropical storm. \u201cThis storm Ophelia has now two sources of energy: the old source of the hurricane and the new source of baroclinic instability,\u201d says Haarsma. Is it happening? \nHowever, Haarsma emphasises that so far the main evidence that more hurricanes will reach Europe comes from modelling. \nIn a study published in March this year, he and his colleagues examined 53 tropical storms that reached Europe between 1979 and 2013. They found no sign of an increase ( Climate Dynamics , doi.org/cd75 ). \nA 2015 study by another group looked at the years 1948-2014 and did find a slight increase in the number of hurricanes that turned north-east like Ophelia ( Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society , doi.org/cd78 ). \nStill, Haarsma remains cautious, saying that so few hurricanes go to Europe that the statistics are likely to be unreliable. \u201cWe still have to rely on models and maybe in the future we will know if we are correct or not,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201d \nHaarsma is part of a project called PRIMAVERA , which is using high-resolution models to simulate future hurricanes in detail. \u201cHurricanes have a small horizontal scale, so traditional models have difficulty simulating [them],\u201d he says. It takes more fine-grained models to capture the detail of hurricanes\u2019 behaviour. \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ophelia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reindert haarsma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dann mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debbie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julian heming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haarsma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ophelia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university of bristol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal netherlands meteorological institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "climate dynamics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe noaa/nasa goddard rapid response team", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geophysical research letters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american meteorological society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk met office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "primavera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de bilt", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T15:21:57.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf541e8ba5b023cd3270027ffe048f635fe4e85a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXy4TV1z6DJ_W_lH3FuPD4VYLoiTPP4kjGicfoweXhTOy8wd6L29CA353WXpPmL6oFvDFPaxvoE1wPs9iGBy9PY2oyqNcB3UArQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/today-on-new-scientist", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "How to clean up the dirty water Puerto Ricans are drinking", "title_full": "How to clean up the dirty water Puerto Ricans are drinking", "published": "2017-10-17T16:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/17133711/gettyimages-858463340.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 98, "comments": 0, "shares": 98}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf541e8ba5b023cd3270027ffe048f635fe4e85a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXy4TV1z6DJ_W_lH3FuPD4VYLoiTPP4kjGicfoweXhTOy8wd6L29CA353WXpPmL6oFvDFPaxvoE1wPs9iGBy9PY2oyqNcB3UArQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-17T16:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to clean up the dirty water Puerto Ricans are drinking", "text": "How to clean up the dirty water Puerto Ricans are drinking Getting clean water is posing problems in Puerto Rico Joe Raedle/Getty By Aylin Woodward \nIt is almost a month since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico , yet nearly 80 per cent of the island is still without electrical power and more than 30 per cent of people there don\u2019t have access to potable drinking water. \nThe US Environmental Protection Agency reports that some citizens are so desperate for drinkable water that they have resorted to obtaining it from wells on a contaminated site, despite signs warning of danger. \nThe Dorado Ground Water Contamination site , which lies west of capital city San Juan on Puerto Rico\u2019s northern coast, contains wells that once provided water to nearly 67,000 people. The EPA added it to its Superfund list of hazardous sites last September, but had not started cleaning it up when Maria struck. \nEPA information from two years ago shows that some wells in the western part of the site are contaminated, whereas some of those in the eastern part meet drinking water standards. On Sunday, the agency said it had taken samples from three western locations that people had used for drinking water and expected results \u201cby the end of next week\u201d. The EPA says it has also reinstalled fences to secure the contaminated wells so people can\u2019t access them. Health risks \nIf people have drunk contaminated water, it could lead to serious health problems. \nOrganic solvents have been identified in the groundwater. They include tetrachloroethylene , which is used in dry-cleaning, and trichloroethylene , which is used to remove grease from metal parts. \nBoth of these solvents are linked to a catalogue of health problems, including neurological issues. In January, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry linked them to an increased risk of cancers and, in the case of trichloroethylene, cardiac defects . \nPeople having to resort to drinking from the site is an \u201cunacceptable situation\u201d, says Michael Stenstrom at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cThey\u2019re drinking from a water source that we\u2019re not sure is contaminated or not, and needs to be tested.\u201d Cleaning up \nIf the water is not seriously contaminated, it may be possible to filter out the worst of the toxins, says Christopher Weis at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. Simple technologies such as activated carbon filters and reverse osmosis would strip out many of the solvents. \u201cBRITA filters are cheaper than flying in water,\u201d he says. \nIn the long run, Puerto Rico\u2019s mains water needs to be brought back online, and that means getting the island\u2019s electrical grid up and running . Without this power, pumps that distribute drinking and bathing water are not working, and nor are water treatment plants \u2013 barring a few running on generators. \nGovernor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 says he wants 95 per cent of the island\u2019s power to be restored by mid-December \u2013 but for many people that would still mean another two months without a working water supply. \n\u201cThey need to get the power on as soon as possible to get the water system operational,\u201d says Akram Alshawabkeh at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cOther solutions are temporary.

A sonic barrier that relies on pre-crimped aluminium may be able to block a wider range of traffic sounds than ever before. \nManoj Thota and Kon-Well Wang at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor have designed a noise barrier that can reduce acoustic energy by 90 per cent, so traffic noise previously audible at 1.6 kilometres away only travels half a kilometre. \nTo date, most attempts at blocking traffic noise rely on erecting concrete walls , but sound can bend over their rigid, flat tops and then continue onward. Then there are barriers made of hollow, perforated cylinders that let air through, but they only block sounds at certain pitches. The distance between one cylinder and the next dictates the range of sounds they can dampen. Advertisement \nThota and Wang\u2019s design gets around that problem using the Miura origami fold, which relies on preset creases. The barrier has three rows of vertical cylinders mounted on a sheet of creased aluminium. When the sheet is flat on the ground, the cylinders are far apart. \nThe cylinders are mounted where the folds meet, so that they rise and fall as sheet is folded, and create an undulating upper edge to the barrier. When the sheet lies flat, the cylinders are far apart. \nThe acoustic-shielding properties of the entire barrier can be changed with a simple shove of the aluminum sheet at its base. One end of the sheet is fixed and a push from the other end bends the sheet into its preset folds, forming a different arrangement of cylinders on top. \nWhen the angle each fold makes reaches 55 degrees, the barrier blocks low-frequency noise that you might hear during rush hour, and at 70 degrees, higher-frequency sounds such as those from free-flowing traffic. Read more: How to make an origami universe \nThota says a real-world application of this design would work best if the barrier is programmed to be in certain configurations at certain times of the day, depending on anticipated traffic conditions. \nIf the barrier works as claimed, says Louis Hagler, a retired physician previously at the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, California, then any or all adverse effects associated with noise might get less severe. \n\u201cPeople who lived near highways might find improvements in sleep; performance at work, home, and school; emotions and mood; and perhaps decreased cardiovascular morbidity,\u201d he says. \nFederica Morandi at the University of Bologna, Italy, says this design could be costly to maintain. She says it may be better suited to indoor use, such as in a factory with machines that emit sounds at different frequencies.

The genes all play a role in the same brain circuit, and may help explain why people are more likely to have OCD if they have a relative with the condition. \nPeople with OCD have intrusive thoughts and feel driven to repeat rituals, such as handwashing , to relieve their anxiety. To investigate if OCD has a genetic basis, Hyun Ji Noh at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and her colleagues compared more than 600 genes across 592 people with OCD, and 560 people who don\u2019t have it. \nThey chose these candidate genes from several lines of evidence. Of these genes, 222 had been linked to compulsive grooming in mice, and 196 had been linked to autism in people \u2013 a condition that can involve repetitive behaviours. Advertisement \nThe team also looked at 56 genes that they had identified in a study of dogs with canine compulsive disorder , a condition in which dogs repeatedly chase their tails, pace back and forth, groom themselves or sucks things, sometimes for hours at a time. Brain safety circuit \nThe analysis identified four genes that are different in people who have OCD. All four of these are active in a brain circuit that links the striatum, thalamus and cortex regions. \nThe striatum is involved in learning and relays messages via the thalamus to the cortex, where decisions are made. In people with OCD, the information passing around this loop can become corrupted. Previous research suggests this makes it harder to tell when a situation is safe or risky . \nThe finding adds to evidence that the disorder has a genetic component, says Jessica Grisham at the University of New South Wales in Australia. \u201cWe know you\u2019re four times more likely to develop OCD if you have a first-degree relative with the disorder,\u201d she says. \nThat doesn\u2019t mean you will necessarily get OCD if your parents have it. \u201cThere\u2019s a complex interaction between genes and environment,\u201d says Grisham. OCD can arise in people without a known family history, sometimes after a traumatic event, she says. Better treatments \nOne of the genes identified in the analysis \u2013 HTR2A \u2013 is also involved in serotonin signalling. This hints that people with OCD may have problems regulating serotonin in their brains, says Noh. \nIf so, this may explain why up to 60 per cent of people with OCD benefit from taking SSRI antidepressants , which boost the amount of serotonin in the brain. About half of dogs with compulsive disorder also respond to SSRIs. \nUnderstanding how the genetic variants affect OCD will hopefully lead to better treatments, says Noh. \u201cWe would like to develop a drug that reverses the effects, either by targeting the gene itself or the pathway it regulates,\u201d she says.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jessica grisham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyun ji noh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice klein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grisham", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ssri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broad institute of mit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new south wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T19:15:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "688b9620a4a4c2dac3bc1c0fafe467651aabf009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX_73bx6O2PU5SRwRoDh30ssemNJTu9i6ZZ91h7doYgcSn5_1W_QWZZAI5h1YAsgnHKYqK5_.P_lW1QujeZUotLyJjUitX_A9EA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Online dating may be breaking down society\u2019s racial divisions", "title_full": "Online dating may be breaking down society\u2019s racial divisions", "published": "2017-10-17T20:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/17171140/gettyimages-522795545.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 155, "comments": 0, "shares": 155}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "688b9620a4a4c2dac3bc1c0fafe467651aabf009", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX_73bx6O2PU5SRwRoDh30ssemNJTu9i6ZZ91h7doYgcSn5_1W_QWZZAI5h1YAsgnHKYqK5_.P_lW1QujeZUotLyJjUitX_A9EA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-17T20:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Online dating may be breaking down society\u2019s racial divisions", "text": "Online dating may be breaking down society\u2019s racial divisions It all starts with a swipe By Douglas Heaven \nPEOPLE often marry people who are just like them \u2013 similar in terms of social background, world view and race. Online dating may be changing that, however, breaking us out of our existing social circles. Economists Josu\u00e9 Ortega at the University of Essex, UK, and Philipp Hergovich at the University of Vienna, Austria, suggest it could even lead to more integrated societies. \nBefore the first dating websites appeared in the 1990s, most people would meet dates through existing networks of friends or colleagues. But the rise of dating sites like Match.com and apps like Tinder has made online dating the norm for many. It is the second most common way for heterosexual partners to meet and the most common for homosexual partners. More than a third of marriages now involve people who met online. \nOrtega and Hergovich claim that if just a small number of online matches are between people of different races, then social integration should occur rapidly. \u201cA few connections can really change the panorama of diversity,\u201d says Ortega. \nThey tested their hypothesis with a simulated social network of male and female \u201cagents\u201d who were looking for a partner of the opposite sex. Initially, each agent was highly connected with agents of their own race, and only poorly so with agents from other races \u2013 mimicking real-world relationships in societies with a large degree of segregation. Advertisement \nBut when they started dropping in the random connections that strangers make on a dating site, their model predicted an increase in the number of interracial marriages. Read more: Rules of attraction \u2013 10 biggest love myths exploded \nIs that what has happened in the real world? The number of interracial marriages in the US has certainly gone up in the last few decades. The researchers also note that the rate of such marriages rose around the time that online dating became popular in the mid-90s. It jumped again in 2014 \u2013 soon after the advent of Tinder. \nEstablishing causation is hard, though, because there are many other factors in play . For example, a growing number of US states have started offering African Americans scholarships to university, where they may have met students of other races. \u201cBut even accounting for those changes, it does not explain what we see,\u201d says Ortega. \nUS black communities have stayed relatively stable in numbers and location. And yet, in the last two decades the likelihood of black people being in interracial marriages in the US has tripled, says Ortega. \u201cOnline dating is a great way to get out of our circles \u2013 not only race but also ideologies.\u201d \nNot everyone is convinced that we can thank online dating for these effects. Michael Rosenfeld at Stanford University in California says research has shown that same-race couples were just as likely to meet online as interracial couples. \u201cMost people who do online dating have a strong preference for same-race partners,\u201d he says. \u201cMeeting online does not appear to increase interracial union.\u201d \nAnd yet, obviously, something has. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cCan Tinder bring social cohesion?\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "douglas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "josu\u00e9 ortega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ortega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hergovich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael rosenfeld", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philipp hergovich", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "match.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of vienna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of essex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T20:56:30.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cd4affe8dd2d5fc9cb48a63b35963f5f0ffcbb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX9zBM0ZEGvdFv08hE7PFrSqOlm2rc29XVKwoda602dXcRc6h_wPcek6rguG8KaYbG2PR4OGIhqhE0o6tMc1ez0SjmhQMFbHOzA--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/in-brief", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "A gaggle of 7 moons keep Saturn\u2019s rings from breaking apart", "title_full": "A gaggle of 7 moons keep Saturn\u2019s rings from breaking apart", "published": "2017-10-17T22:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/17185317/main_1200.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 477, "comments": 0, "shares": 477}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cd4affe8dd2d5fc9cb48a63b35963f5f0ffcbb4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX9zBM0ZEGvdFv08hE7PFrSqOlm2rc29XVKwoda602dXcRc6h_wPcek6rguG8KaYbG2PR4OGIhqhE0o6tMc1ez0SjmhQMFbHOzA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-17T22:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "A gaggle of 7 moons keep Saturn\u2019s rings from breaking apart", "text": "A gaggle of 7 moons keep Saturn\u2019s rings from breaking apart Saturn\u2019s moons band together to corral its rings NASA / JPL-Caltech / Space Science Institute By Joshua Sokol \nTidying up Saturn\u2019s rings takes teamwork. One ring in particular owes its manicured appearance to no fewer than seven moons working together, according to new results released this week at the American Astronomical Society\u2019s Division of Planetary Sciences meeting in Provo, Utah. \nWe already knew that Saturn\u2019s biggest and brightest ring, the B ring, is kept in check by gravitational nudges from the large moon Mimas . Left alone, friction inside the ring would cause its icy particles to spill out both on the inner and outer edges. Eventually, the ring would broaden and disperse. But the presence of Mimas trims the B ring\u2019s outer edge by pushing wayward particles back inside. \nScientists long thought that the A ring, which orbits further out, was hemmed in the same way by the smaller moon Janus. But this was giving Janus too much credit, says Radwan Tajeddine at Cornell University in New York. \u201cI realized it can\u2019t be holding the edge,\u201d he says, because it isn\u2019t massive enough. Advertisement Redirecting the flow \nTajeddine and his team created computer models based on data from Cassini, the probe that ended its 13-year mission to the Saturn system by plunging into the giant planet\u2019s atmosphere in September. \nTheir modelling suggests that besides just Janus, a sextet of other moons also pitch in: Pan, Atlas, Prometheus, Pandora, Epimetheus and Mimas. \n\u201cIf these moons weren\u2019t working together, the A ring would have spread out over hundreds of millions of years,\u201d says Cassini member Linda Spilker at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, was not part of the research team. They accomplish this like pebbles in a streambed piling up and redirecting the stream\u2019s flow, she says. \nIn Tajeddine\u2019s model, small gravitational tugs from each moon create density waves in which thicker material piles up inside the ring at specific locations. Those pileups then absorb angular momentum from the particles in the ring, stealing enough that little Janus on the A ring\u2019s outer edge can hold the line. \n\u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly right,\u201d says Joe Spitale of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, who also did not participate in the research. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things we\u2019ve been staring at for years, and it should have been obvious.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pandora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe spitale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radwan tajeddine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tajeddine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mimas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda spilker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "saturn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cassini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpl-caltech / space science institute tidying", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american astronomical society\u2019s division of planetary sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornell university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "planetary science institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tucson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "provo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tajeddine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pasadena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T22:17:28.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d071d5c67734c2a0c1f202ffe256bc9482bc8ec0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX90AUSt9lbr.HjXzdZT6BDHoBnbX11cw9ufRrhj17tCvDi48DE2TL25D2JUAraiPSAxA33c85TrbFSIw1vsVlR8IMXuluwFhGQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/lastword", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Astronaut wee could show us how the plumes on Enceladus work", "title_full": "Astronaut wee could show us how the plumes on Enceladus work", "published": "2017-10-18T02:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/13180000/enceladus12_cassini_big.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 110, "comments": 0, "shares": 110}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d071d5c67734c2a0c1f202ffe256bc9482bc8ec0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX90AUSt9lbr.HjXzdZT6BDHoBnbX11cw9ufRrhj17tCvDi48DE2TL25D2JUAraiPSAxA33c85TrbFSIw1vsVlR8IMXuluwFhGQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-18T02:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Astronaut wee could show us how the plumes on Enceladus work", "text": "Astronaut wee could show us how the plumes on Enceladus work A little like wee NASA By Leah Crane \nIt\u2019s just a wee moon, but Saturn\u2019s icy satellite Enceladus is one of the most promising places in the solar system in the hunt for alien life. Examining how spaceships vent urine could help us understand the small moon\u2019s jets of water, which may spew out signs of life along with liquid. \nAt Enceladus\u2019s south pole, plumes of liquid water and tiny ice shards spurt up from an ocean hidden under a thick sheath of ice. Despite the pictures we have of this region from NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft, we don\u2019t know much about the inner workings of the plumes because the probe could only detect one size of ice grain at a time, leaving scientists to guess at the overall distribution. \nBut Ralph Lorenz at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland says that we could use other jets of water in space \u2013 the ones formed as spacecraft release astronaut pee and waste water from fuel cells \u2013 as an analogue to better understand that distribution. He presented this work at the American Astronomical Society\u2019s meeting of the Division of Planetary Sciences on 17 October. Advertisement Whizzing water \nWhen water whizzes out into the cold vacuum of space, some of it freezes instantaneously. In 1989, researchers at a telescope in Hawaii observed this process as the Discovery space shuttle dumped water from its fuel cells. \n\u201cThere was a population of ice grains that were basically the size of the vent, but there\u2019s a second population of much smaller grains that were interpreted as basically recondensing from the vapour,\u201d says Lorenz. \u201cThat is probably the type of distribution that we\u2019ll see on Enceladus.\u201d \nThe plumes on Enceladus are far bigger and likely less uniform on the inside than a simple metal tube spraying out water, though. On the space shuttle, water being dumped formed long icicles on the outside of the nozzle in some cases, so the same may happen at Enceladus and change the structure of the vents over time, Lorenz says. \nUrine vented from the space shuttle left a residue when tiny particles of wee ice hit the craft\u2019s panels, so he suggests that future missions to Enceladus could have detectors that look for signatures of life in the miniscule dents left by ice grains there. A bit of a stretch \n\u201cIt seems like a stretch to me,\u201d says Hunter Waite at the Southwest Research Institute in Texas. \u201cThe temperature of the water reservoir and how the liquid interacts with the ice walls that are several kilometres thick are important factors, and they don\u2019t seem to have an analogue in this system.\u201d \nLorenz says that even though the spacecraft water-dumping process is much simpler than Enceladus\u2019s vents, it could still help us validate our models of the moon\u2019s jets. \n\u201cThese observations don\u2019t tell us directly what\u2019s happening on Enceladus, but they provide a sort of anchor for our interpretations of what we\u2019re seeing on Enceladus and our designs for a new mission to go there,\u201d says Lorenz.

Cracking down on this has been difficult, with the illegal trade driven principally by the false belief that rhino horn can cure ailments from kidney stones to cancer. For the criminal syndicates that sell it, profits are greater than for gold or cocaine. \nPhotographer Brent Stirton has spent more than five years tracking the ongoing atrocity, and London\u2019s Natural History Museum has now awarded his work the grand title at 2017\u2019s Wildlife Photographer of the Year awards. The winning image, Memorial to a Species (above), captures a black rhino with its horn hacked off, in Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Game Park in South Africa. \nStirton\u2019s work not only shines a light \u201con a species being pushed to the brink of extinction, but also on the issues of human morality and compassion for the animals we share this planet with\u201d, says Liz Bonnin, who presents the awards. \nIn his series, Stirton also included the volunteers who rescue the offspring of poached rhinos.

Such nest mounds, constructed from leaves, soil, and debris, can reach a height of 2 metres. \nWhen the structure is complete, the brush turkey invites several females to mate on it, and if any of them like the male\u2019s oven, they will return later to deposit their eggs in it. (No guarantees of paternity included.) \nThe decaying organic matter adds the necessary heat to hatch the brood. When Gerry Pearce spotted this individual insulating his oven near Garigal National Park, near Sydney, to make it warmer, he snapped this picture. Seven weeks later, several chicks hatched \u2013 and immediately left town. \u201cCrab surprise\u201d: Winner, Behaviour Justin Gilligan/Wildlife Photographer of the Year \nA Maori octopus \u2013 the largest in the southern hemisphere, with an arm span of up to 3 metres \u2013 attempts to take advantage of a swarm of giant spider crabs off the east coast of Tasmania. \nThe crabs were aggregating for safety, ahead of moulting, which is a period where they are soft and vulnerable. \u201cGiant gathering\u201d: Winner, Behaviour Tony Wu/Wildlife Photographer of the Year \nSperm whales live in groups of up to 12 individuals, but once in a while come together in mass \u201cscratchathons\u201d \u2013 congregations of hundreds of animals who rub against each other, shedding encrusted layers of skin in a gathering that has both a social and an exfoliating function.

But its ramifications will be felt for much longer than that. \nThe WPA2 security protocol has been a mandatory requirement for all devices using the Wi-Fi protocol since 2006, which translates into billions of laptops, mobiles and routers. The weakness identified by Mathy Vanhoef, a digital security researcher at the Catholic University of Leuven (KUL) in Belgium, lies in the way devices running WPA2 encrypt information . \nEach time a device joins a network, it exchanges messages with the router in what is known as a \u201cfour-way handshake\u201d. Vanhoef, who will present his findings next month at the Association for Computing Machinery\u2019s Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Dallas, Texas, found it is possible to interfere with this handshake. Advertisement \nThat allows a hacker to gain access to any sensitive information sent over a network \u2013 credit card numbers, passwords, chat messages, emails and photos \u2013 regardless of passwords or encryption . \n\u201cAny device that uses Wi-Fi is likely vulnerable,\u201d says Vanhoef. He alerted technology firms to the vulnerability in July. \nFixing the problem is a matter of a straightforward software update, but while Microsoft has already released a patch to fix the problem on devices running its software, Google and Apple have still to release updates that will do the same. \nHowever, among the most vulnerable devices are those running Google\u2019s Android 6.0 or later \u2013 Vanhoef estimates that 41 per cent of the world\u2019s 2 billion Android devices are susceptible. Fundamental problem \nThat\u2019s because the problem is not in devices \u2013 it\u2019s in the Wi-Fi standard itself. That means how vulnerable a device is depends entirely on how closely it adheres to the standard. Android adheres strictly. Apple and Microsoft products, on the other hand, don\u2019t do it as much, so are only prone to unusual variations of the attack. \nThe good news is that there are some barriers to exploiting this vulnerability. \u201cThe attacker\u2019s computer needs to be close to the victim, probably within 100 metres,\u201d says Steven Murdoch at University College London. \u201cAlso, the code that implements the attack has not been published, so it is going to take quite a lot of work to re-implement it based on the description in the paper.\u201d \nThat still means someone sat in a cafe or outside a home, for example, could access information being sent over its Wi-Fi network. Alan Woodward, a computer security expert at the University of Surrey, UK, thinks that with appropriate antennas, the range from which an attack is possible \u201ccan be further than you might think\u201d. \nAfter alerting technology companies, in August Vanhoef notified the US Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT). But he agreed not to publicly release the details for several months to allow the firms to fix their software. \u201cSadly not all vendors have been quite as swift [as Microsoft] at producing the patches,\u201d says Woodward. \u201cThere are still many device manufacturers who have yet to say whether they are vulnerable and if they have been patched.\u201d \nApple has patched the issue in beta versions of its current operating systems that will be released in a few weeks.

Tracking it down could transform how we see the stars NASA/SDO/Goddard Space Flight Center By Shannon Palus \nTHERE is a hole in the sun. Right in the middle, a mass the size of 1500 Earths has simply disappeared. Much of what we know about the sun\u2019s behaviour says it should be there \u2013 but when we interpret the data encoded in sunlight, that chunk of stuff is nowhere to be seen. \nThat has shaken up our understanding of how the sun works , and physicists are struggling to figure out what fills that hole. It could be a thing, like dark matter. It could be a concept, with elements such as carbon and nitrogen simply behaving in a way we didn\u2019t expect under crushing pressure. Or perhaps we\u2019re looking at the sun in the wrong way. \nIt\u2019s a very hot problem, says Sunny Vagnozzi, a physicist at Stockholm University in Sweden. That\u2019s no joke. The sun is important not just because it supplies the heat and light that sustain us. It is also our key to the wider universe, the reference against which we measure stars: their brightness, their age, how likely their solar systems are to support life . Start messing with the sun, and the consequences stretch as far as our telescopes can see. \u201cIf we get the sun wrong, we get everything wrong,\u201d says Sarbani Basu at Yale University. \nIt\u2019s not easy to figure out what\u2019s inside the sun. \u201cWe can\u2019t go and take a sample,\u201d says Basu. There are two main ways to investigate. Helioseismologists such as Basu look at sound vibrations on the sun\u2019s surface, which give outward evidence of the vast quantities of energy being unleashed within.

Sheldrick used to organise live music events, but one of the hardest things was simply finding the venue. \u201cGetting musicians just to show up at the right place is surprisingly difficult,\u201d he told an expert panel and audience at City of Tomorrow: Shaping The Urban Future We All Share , an event organised by Ford Motor Company at LSO St Luke\u2019s in Old Street \u2013 the heart of London\u2019s Silicon Roundabout. Or as Sheldrick would put it: zebra trout until. \nMore than half the world\u2019s population live in cities. Around the globe, urban areas are rapidly growing and changing. How can we ensure that cities work for everyone who lives and works in them? Ford has been holding a series of events to explore new opportunities and experiments to keep inhabitants moving. The latest in London brought together innovators, transport experts, CEOs, academics, urban designers and entrepreneurs. \nSheldrick is CEO and founder of what3words , a company that is re-inventing addresses. His solution might not be what you\u2019d expect, however. Sheldrick wanted a system that would be unambiguous. There are 18 roads in London called Church Road and 632 streets in Mexico City called Juarez Street, for example. What about GPS coordinates? \u201cI tried to get people using latitude and longitude,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people make mistakes and getting one number wrong puts you in the wrong place completely.\u201d \nSo what3words has chopped up the entire surface of the planet into 3-metre squares \u2013 57 million of them \u2013 and given each a unique three-word name, such as zebra trout until or toffee branch pyramid. The company has tested its system with the help of London-based courier Quiqup. They gave two drivers 20 pickup and delivery locations to visit as quickly as they could. One driver used street addresses, the other used three-word addresses. The driver using what3words\u2019s system completed the route 2 hours before the other, taking around 30 per cent less time overall. \nLess time on the road is good news for congestion and should make delivery companies happy too. According to what3words, 90 per cent of leading European e-commerce and logistics companies believe that postal addresses are a barrier to e-commerce growth. Their concerns are backed up by a recent YouGov survey, which found that 56 per cent of online shoppers had experienced a problem with the delivery of an order in the last year. Another survey from Citizens Advice states that between 2015 and 2016 consumers experienced 4.8 million delivery problems and spent 11.8 million hours sorting them out. Mark Miodownik from UCL\u2019s Institute of Making, with Sarah-Jayne Williams, Ford Europe\u2019s director of smart mobility \nDeliveries are also the focus of a recent study done by Ford. All members of the panel \u2013 which included Sheldrick, Ford\u2019s director of smart mobility in Europe Sarah-Jayne Williams, materials scientist and head of UCL\u2019s Institute of Making Mark Miodownik, physicist and author Laurie Winkless, with New Scientist \u2019s editorial director Valerie Jamieson chairing \u2013 agreed that technological development should be kept focused on the needs of people. \nBut with the hype surrounding smart cities and driverless cars, it is easy to get carried away with tech for tech\u2019s sake. That\u2019s why Ford is keen to explore the relationship people will have with these machines, said Williams. \u201cUntil we grow people\u2019s trust and confidence, driverless cars are not inevitable.\u201d \nFord is working with a mix of tech companies, car companies and government authorities to make the human side of autonomous vehicles a reality. In August, Ford kicked off a collaboration with Domino\u2019s to deliver pizzas in a novel way . Customers in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were selected at random to have their pizza driven to them in a Ford Fusion Hybrid autonomous research vehicle. \nBut in this case, getting the pizza to its destination is the easy part. What Ford is interested in is the response of the customers, who will have to fetch their pizza from the car themselves instead of receiving it from a delivery person at their door. Will people be willing to walk to the kerb? Will they be able to see which side of the car their pizza is on? Ford\u2019s observations will be important, since these kinds of consideration can make or break new technologies. \nWinkless brought up another issue concerning people\u2019s reaction to driverless cars. With humans behind the wheel, it is easy for pedestrians and drivers to exchange glances to tell each other what they are about to do. Is it safe to cross the road or is the car about to pull out? You can\u2019t make eye contact with a driverless car, however. \nWorking with the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, Williams explained how Ford is exploring ways that vehicles can communicate with pedestrians and human drivers by themselves. In one study, a person drove around a city in a Ford Transit Connect wearing a car-seat costume so that it looked as if there was nobody in the car. The apparently empty car certainly got some odd looks. But people also noticed the flashing lights above the windscreen that changed pattern when the car was stopped and when it was about to drive off. \u201cWe want to see if there are universally accepted standards we can create that will let vehicles communicate,\u201d said Williams. Raise your hand if you\u2019d send your child to school in a driverless car \nExperiments like these may push the adoption of autonomous vehicles just as much as technological breakthroughs. So Jamieson put a question to the audience: How many of you would send your children to school in a driverless car? Most of the room raised their hand. \nReinvented addresses and self-driving cars promise to make getting from A to B quicker and easier than it has ever been. But only if the roads are good enough. Ageing infrastructure is a strain on UK cities, said Miodownik. Many roads and buildings were built in the 1960s and 70s, during a post-war boom. \u201cNow there\u2019s a huge amount of repair that needs to be done to keep them standing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear we are wealthy enough to keep that level of infrastructure going at the moment.\u201d \nMiodownik thinks autonomous vehicles can help. His team is talking to Leeds city council about self-repairing roads . \u201cImagine a crack opens up in a road,\u201d he said. \u201cWho would detect that?\u201d If cars were fitted with cameras to watch the road as they drove over it, even minor defects could be caught early. Each car would be connected to a network that was constantly updated with the condition of all roads in a given region. \nWhen a repair was needed, a robot could go out in the middle of the night when traffic was sparse to 3D-print tar into the crack. \u201cIf you can stop that crack becoming a pothole I can\u2019t tell you how many millions of pounds a city would save over time,\u201d said Miodownik. \u201cDriverless vehicles could detect the cracks and also repair them.\u201d \nFord is also working on road repairs, said Williams. \u201cPotholes are not a sexy subject but everyone cares about them.\u201d Ford\u2019s test track in Lommel, Belgium, has replicas of some of the world\u2019s worst potholes. Ford is using it to develop car-mounted sensors to monitor the conditions of roads. \u201cThe question will be who collates this information, who acts on it and when,\u201d said Williams. \nUltimately, the head start that developed countries have had in building city infrastructure may hold them back. For many innovations shaping the cities of the future, we should look to the developing world, said Winkless. In India, roads are being repaired with plastic bags, for example. Waste plastic is shredded, mixed with bitumen and used as to patch up cracks. \nIt\u2019s just one example of how some poorer countries are adopting new technologies more quickly than the US or Europe. Without landlines, many African nations are going straight to mobile. Without banks, Africa is also pioneering the use of mobile payments. And without good roads, Rwanda is delivering blood to remote clinics by drone. \nThe event showed how the city of tomorrow holds many exciting possibilities \u2013 and raises just as many challenges. It will take unprecedented collaboration between governments, business leaders, creatives and more to get there. As Jamieson said, the city of tomorrow isn\u2019t a destination, it\u2019s a journey.

Good news, you may have the skills to work in cybersecurity . An online training platform launching next week in the UK \u2013 with the backing of Robert Hannigan, the former director of the country\u2019s GCHQ intelligence agency \u2013 is designed to make cybersecurity roles tempting to people, whatever their background. \nCyberattacks now bring organisations to their knees with worrying frequency. Earlier this year the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomwares shut down multiple organisations around the world. And in the last few weeks, details emerged of two of the biggest data hacks ever: the US credit reporting agency Equifax revealed that tens of millions of people\u2019s personal data had been stolen from it, and Yahoo admitted that a large hack in 2013 had compromised all of its 3 billion users\u2019 accounts. \nThere simply are not enough people with the skills to fend off such attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fill roles just from computer science students,\u201d says James Hadley, CEO of Immersive Labs, the UK company behind the new platform \u2013 the Digital Cyber Academy .

People from non-technical backgrounds could bring new perspectives to what is as much a people problem as a computer one. \nHadley, who used to be teach cybersecurity, thinks that students with a wider range of experience would inject fresh ideas. Anyone good at analysing a situation, troubleshooting and problem-solving \u2013 or simply with perseverance and curiosity \u2013 fits the bill, he says. \n\u201cA strong grasp of the technology is valuable, but it\u2019s by no means sufficient,\u201d says Andrew Martin, director of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security at the University of Oxford. \u201cDecades of vulnerabilities in popular software products tell us that good software engineers can screw things up quite badly.\u201d Jobs via a leaderboard \nMartin thinks the Digital Cyber Academy is a good idea. For now, the platform is aimed at UK students, who can sign up here . It will offer a range of training courses from complete beginner level to advanced. Scores for completing exercises will be posted to a leaderboard. Companies will then be able to invite candidates who have reached a certain level of competence to apply for roles. \nHadley says the platform will be constantly updated with the latest developments. For example, an existing training platform that Immersive Labs sells to firms for internal recruiting added an exercise about the NotPetya ransomware on the day it hit. \u201cPeople could read about it in the morning and get their hands dirty in the afternoon,\u201d says Hadley. \nUltimately, Immersive Labs hopes to address entrenched preconceptions about cybersecurity. When Equifax revealed in September that it had been the victim of an attack that exposed the names, addresses and social security numbers of nearly half the US population, critics pounced on the fact that its head of security had a music degree. \n\u201cThat was hugely frustrating,\u201d says Hadley. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to remove these misconceptions.\u201d He says that music has formal patterns and logic that align quite well with cybersecurity. \u201cMany in cybersecurity are self-taught,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to encourage that behaviour.\u201d \nMartin agrees. \u201cMany cybersecurity issues arise from the realities of human nature or the way we organise society,\u201d he says. Fixing them requires a diverse set of skills. \u201cThe ideal security director is a polymath.\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert hannigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james hadley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hadley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yahoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital cyber academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centre for doctoral training", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gchq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "immersive labs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T19:27:59.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "180694d4b7a5336a97d0891f2bc6266166459f28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh_zP3j_yKUXo5y1e4g81DX6YZ67J9rBWNX8VwswIi7mE1TtSgC2o6D1EGrLI3i9zXI_hzLSPLeBUL_I2U1AzIS8FBKX.Vcg18OJfa8EOjIQot.OJQahFAIm", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/crime-and-forensics", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Police body cams were meant to keep us safer.

Equipping police officers with body-worn cameras was intended to defuse tense situations, but footage of brutal incidents keeps going viral On the record Yui Mok - WPA Pool/Getty Images By Alice Klein \nPOLICE body-worn cameras have taken off like a flash. The UK has deployed more than 17,000 in the past year, the US is in the midst of rolling out 50,000 , Australia has introduced 10,000 since 2015 and other countries are following suit. \nThe idea behind them is simple: recording interactions between cops and citizens should reduce aggression and help to convict either party if they cross the line. \nHowever, a string of recent, often racially charged, incidents has shaken public confidence in these devices. Last week, outrage was sparked by newly released video of Salt Lake City police officer Clinton Fox killing Patrick Harmon when he ran away after being pulled over on 13 August for cycling across six lanes of traffic and lacking a rear light. The footage, captured by body cams worn by Fox and his fellow officers, shows him yelling \u201cI\u2019ll fucking shoot you!\u201d before firing. \nThe district attorney\u2019s office ruled that the killing was legally justified, saying that in slowed footage, Harmon turned to face Fox while holding a knife. The FBI has been asked to review the case. \nIn another incident, last month footage went viral of a Salt Lake City police officer roughly handcuffing a nurse in full view of his colleague\u2019s body cam. And in Australia, an officer is being investigated for punching a drunk teenager after his colleague switched off his camera. \u201cMany police departments leave it up to the discretion of officers as to when they activate their cameras\u201d \nSo are police body cameras actually helping anyone? \nThe technology To continue reading this premium article, subscribe for unlimited access.

But then AlphaGo, Google DeepMind\u2019s AI player, started to leave even the best human opponents in the dust . Yet even this world-beating AI needed humans to learn from. Then, on Wednesday, DeepMind\u2019s new version ditched people altogether. \nAlphaGo Zero has surpassed its predecessor\u2019s abilities, bypassing AI\u2019s traditional method of learning games, which involves watching thousands of hours of human play. Instead, it simply starts playing at random, honing its skills by repeatedly playing against itself. Three days and 4.9 million such games later, the result is the world\u2019s best Go-playing AI. \n\u201cIt\u2019s more powerful than previous approaches because we\u2019ve removed the constraints of human knowledge,\u201d says David Silver, the lead researcher for AlphaGo. Advertisement \n\u201cHumankind has accumulated Go knowledge from millions of games played over thousands of years,\u201d the authors write in their paper. \u201cIn the space of a few days\u2026 AlphaGo Zero was able to rediscover much of this Go knowledge, as well as novel strategies that provide new insights into the oldest of games.\u201d Read more: How scaremongering stops us asking the right questions about AI \nAlphaGo Zero\u2019s alternative approach has allowed it to discover strategies humans have never found. For example, it learned many different josekis \u2013 sequences of moves that result in no net loss for either side. Plenty of josekis have been written down during the thousands of years Go has been played, and initially AlphaGo Zero learned many of the familiar ones. But as its self-training continued, it started to favour previously unknown sequences. \nTo test these new moves, DeepMind pitted AlphaGo Zero against the version that beat 18-time world champion Lee Sedol. In a 100-game grudge match , it won 100-0. This is despite only training for three days, compared to several months for its predecessor. After 40 days of training, it also won 89-11 against a better version of AlphaGo that had defeated world number one Ke Jie ( Nature , DOI: 10.1038/nature24270 ). \u201cIt\u2019s more powerful because we have removed the constraints of human knowledge\u201d \nDeepMind hopes this method will have applications beyond Go. \u201cThe team are already working to apply this to scientific problems like protein-folding,\u201d said CEO Demis Hassabis at a press conference on Monday. Climate science, drug discovery and quantum chemistry could also benefit, he said. \nThis approach might also solve one of the thorniest issues that has faced AI: the need for copious training data. \u201cWith this approach you no longer have to rely on getting expert quality human data,\u201d says David Churchill at Memorial University, Canada. \nYet there are drawbacks too. For an AI to learn by itself, it needs to be programmed with the rules of the world it inhabits. That works for worlds with clear and simple rules, but would quickly become impossible for more complicated tasks like driving. \nEven in cases for which the rules are clear, AlphaGo Zero\u2019s abilities may not transfer. Although Go is a challenging game, it still has many attributes that tailor it to conquest by AI systems. \nSo although DeepMind has now created the world\u2019s best Go player twice, it will have a tougher task proving that the same approach can be useful beyond board games. \u201cIn 10 years, I hope that these kinds of algorithms will be routinely advancing the frontiers of scientific research,\u201d says Hassabis. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cGo-playing super AI transcends humanity\u201d \nMore on these topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lee sedol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deepmind", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david silver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hassabis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "demis hassabis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david churchill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timothy revell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ke jie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "memorial university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T21:19:14.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfad7decc0a1f9f4cdf7572f9141936724f31270", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXwqqJvvaKpbFlj4asFQo..nvITg69N8LkzaLnCglKfBl_MF_NTv.aMlgHfXtYm1lUn7j2tCH6v6NzTURqiupnNeze63tOl8bcQ--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/energy-fuels", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Hunger-blocking injection lets fat monkeys quickly lose weight", "title_full": "Hunger-blocking injection lets fat monkeys quickly lose weight", "published": "2017-10-18T22:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/18134741/gettyimages-587195677.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 725, "comments": 0, "shares": 725}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfad7decc0a1f9f4cdf7572f9141936724f31270", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUXwqqJvvaKpbFlj4asFQo..nvITg69N8LkzaLnCglKfBl_MF_NTv.aMlgHfXtYm1lUn7j2tCH6v6NzTURqiupnNeze63tOl8bcQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-18T22:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hunger-blocking injection lets fat monkeys quickly lose weight", "text": "Hunger-blocking injection lets fat monkeys quickly lose weight Need some help with your hunger? Erik Jonsson/EyeEm/Getty By Alice Klein \nA protein injection that decreases appetite helps obese monkeys to slim down fast and cuts their risk of diabetes. \nExcitement is growing about a protein called GDF15, which naturally regulates body weight in humans and animals. When extra amounts are injected into mice, they eat less, lose weight and have fewer signs of diabetes . \nSeveral research teams have tried developing GDF15 as an obesity treatment, but it breaks down too quickly in the bloodstream to work. Advertisement \nNow a team led by Murielle V\u00e9niant at pharmaceutical company Amgen has found a way to make GDF15 last longer in the body. Dropping pounds \nThe team added an antibody fragment onto GDF15. Antibodies are immune proteins that help recognise foreign molecules in the body. \nThey found that this hybrid protein caused obese monkeys to eat about 40 per cent less. When given weekly injections, the monkeys lost 10 per cent of their body weight over 6 weeks. Their glucose tolerance also improved, making them less likely to develop type 2 diabetes. \nIn comparison, the five obesity medications that are currently approved by the FDA for long-term weight management help patients to lose an average of 7 to 12 per cent of their body weight over the course of a year. Bariatric surgery \u2013 the gold standard for weight loss \u2013 usually results in 20 to 30 per cent weight loss in obese patients in the first year, but is expensive and can have complications and side-effects. \nThe GDF15 hybrid protein did not cause any noticeable side-effects in monkeys, V\u00e9niant says, although she adds that the study was designed primarily to assess how effective the drug is. Clinical trials will be needed to work out how well the treatment works in people, and if it causes side-effects like nausea, she says. Gut-brain interaction \nInjecting the protein into mice revealed that it binds to neurons in the stomach and intestines. These gut nerve cells send signals to the area postrema, a part of the brain known to reduce appetite and change dietary tastes. \nWhen given the protein, mice were found to keep food in their stomachs for twice as long \u2013 which may make them feel fuller. Treated mice also chose to eat healthier food. \nAmgen is not the only pharmaceutical company that is interested in targeting the GDF15 pathway. Since August, Janssen , NGM Bio , Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have all published papers in Nature studying GDF15\u2019s role in regulating body weight. Janssen and NGM Bio have also announced they are testing a range of compounds similar to GDF15.

Extracts taken from plants of the genus Aristolochia , which are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat a wide range of conditions, may be responsible for many liver cancers in Asia. \nThere are over 500 species of Aristolochia , around 100 of which have been used in herbal medicines . \u201cThey have very beautiful, trumpet-shaped flowers,\u201d says Steven Rozen at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. This has led to them being given names like \u201cDutchman\u2019s pipe\u201d. \nExtracts of the plants \u2013 taken from the flowers, root or stem, for example \u2013 have long been used in herbal medicine. But fears over their safety were raised in the 1990s, when women who were given trial weight loss drugs containing Aristolochia extracts developed kidney failure . Since then, the plant extracts have also been linked to Balkan nephropathy \u2013 a kidney disease affecting people in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Serbia. Advertisement \nIn 2013, researchers found that a compound in the plants, known as aristolochic acid, seems to cause gene mutations by targeting the base adenine , a component of DNA\u2019s genetic code. \u201cIt attacks any part of the genome with equal opportunity,\u201d says Rozen. Cases worldwide \nWhen a member of Rozen\u2019s team spotted the same type of mutation occurring in liver cancer , the group wondered if plants that contain aristolochic acid might increase a person\u2019s chances of developing the disease. \nThe team looked for the mutation in 98 liver tumour samples taken at two hospitals in Taiwan. Aristolochia plants are used widely in herbal treatments in this country. \n\u201cI was dumbstruck to find the evidence of exposure to aristolochic acid in 78 per cent of cases,\u201d says Rozen. \u201cThis indicates strongly that aristolochic acid was one of the causes of these cancers.\u201d \nAnalysing genetic cancer data from other countries, Rozen\u2019s team found a link between adenosine mutations and liver cancer in many cases from China, Japan and Korea. The same mutation appeared to be linked to 10 per cent of cases in North America, and 5 per cent of liver cancers in the UK. However, aristolochic acid may not be the only cause of the cancer-linked mutation, so it\u2019s unclear how many of these cases were caused by herbal medicine. \nExtracts from some Aristolochia species have already been banned in countries like Taiwan, but many others are widely available, and even banned ones can be found online, says Rozen. \u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult to regulate,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to warn people of the dangers of aristocholic acid.\u201d Journal reference: Science Translational Medicine , DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aan6446 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "katie garrod/getty by jes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rozen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven rozen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aristolochia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "duke-nus medical school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "romania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bosnia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aristolochia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulgaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "serbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "croatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T22:52:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7f2aa14dfe5230dea7e21781e1d7b7a6857dc15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX2u2xw3zcjBeP4DedF1T78ErjoC2VSLKJESzby6R48.hp.WNFN6CY6aHwY5JsuWEfOuoWFnQ_090rewfr9moJl93WzPZjqWL8w--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://news.google.co.in/news?pz=1&cf=all&ned=in&hl=en&topic=snc&output=rss", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "Science - Google News", "title": "The 5 biggest discoveries from the hunt for gravitational waves - New Scientist", "title_full": "The 5 biggest discoveries from the hunt for gravitational waves - New Scientist", "published": "2017-10-18T23:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/18195942/gettyimages-52174041.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1089, "comments": 0, "shares": 1089}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7f2aa14dfe5230dea7e21781e1d7b7a6857dc15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX2u2xw3zcjBeP4DedF1T78ErjoC2VSLKJESzby6R48.hp.WNFN6CY6aHwY5JsuWEfOuoWFnQ_090rewfr9moJl93WzPZjqWL8w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-18T23:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "The 5 biggest discoveries from the hunt for gravitational waves - New Scientist", "text": "The 5 biggest discoveries from the hunt for gravitational waves Gravitational waves reveal our warped universe Joe McNally/Getty By Leah Crane \nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) made waves this week with the announcement of the first direct observation of a neutron star merger. The discovery marks the fifth definitive observation of gravitational waves made by the collaboration in the two years since starting up. \nBut what have we learned from seeing and hearing signals from gravitational waves? We\u2019re being stretched and squeezed all the time \nIn 1916, Albert Einstein predicted that as massive objects like black holes or neutron stars move, they should cause wrinkles in space-time that would stretch and squeeze everything in the universe. With LIGO\u2019s first detection of gravitational waves in 2015, we learned that everything, including Earth and our whole bodies, is being warped all the time. When the sources of the gravitational waves are far away \u2013 as they have been for every detection we\u2019ve made so far \u2013 we\u2019re warped by an imperceptible amount. But if the black holes or neutron stars causing the waves were closer, we\u2019d be able to feel our bodies being alternately stretched and squished as the cosmic behemoths moved. Advertisement Black holes exist \nThis might seem obvious: of course black holes exist, we\u2019ve known about them for decades. But before LIGO, we had never directly observed a black hole . We knew that there was something extremely heavy and small at the centre of our galaxy and many others, but since black holes by definition don\u2019t let any light out, we couldn\u2019t know for sure that\u2019s what they were. LIGO proved once and for all that they exist, and also that they can orbit one another and merge into a single, larger black hole. We learned how heavy elements are formed \nHydrogen and helium, the lightest elements, were formed in the big bang. Most of the elements heavier than helium but lighter than zirconium are created by stars and supernovae. But we\u2019ve never been able to prove how the heaviest elements are created. During the most recent gravitational wave detection, telescopes saw signatures of elements like gold, platinum, and lead forming in the aftermath of a neutron star smashup. LIGO researchers say the collision produced somewhere around 10 times the mass of Earth in gold. Similar events may be responsible for most or even all of the heavy elements in the universe. We learned what short-duration gamma ray bursts are \nWhen the two neutron stars touched, the first thing they spewed out was a jet of gamma radiation, which was detected by NASA\u2019s Fermi space telescope seconds after the gravitational wave from the merger washed over LIGO\u2019s detectors. We\u2019ve seen gamma ray bursts like this one over the past decade or so and suspected that they might come from merging neutron stars, but nobody has been able to prove it. It\u2019s also evidence that this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve watched two neutron stars merge. As long as we\u2019ve been observing gamma ray bursts, we\u2019ve been looking at neutron star mergers \u2013 but we couldn\u2019t be sure that\u2019s what they were until now. Our predictions about our universe are good \nEverything we\u2019ve learned from gravitational waves so far has been extensively modeled and predicted ahead of time. We knew almost exactly how the gravitational waves from a pair of merging black holes or neutron stars would sound. We knew that black holes theoretically existed, and roughly how they should orbit and collide. We were pretty sure that neutron star collisions would make heavy elements and short gamma ray bursts. With its most recent detection, LIGO was able to measure the expansion of the universe, and its measurement was consistent with calculations made with other methods.

Suicide risk \nHis team\u2019s analysis found that, in more than half of cases, there was no documented referral of a self-harming teenager to mental health services. Children in the poorest areas were 23 per cent less likely to be referred within a year of their self-harming episode than children living in the richest areas. \nThe study also found that those who had self-harmed were 17 times more likely to die by suicide . \n\u201cThese results emphasise the opportunity for earlier intervention in primary care to reduce suicide risk,\u201d says Kapur. \nJournal reference: British Medical Journal \nNeed a listening ear?

Just open a forgotten cupboard and you could find a new species The bird collection at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC USNM Bird Collection, Department of Vertebrate Zoology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution Photo by Chip Clark By Christopher Kemp \nA COUPLE of years ago, Stylianos Chatzimanolis received a box of insects in the post. The package came from London\u2019s Natural History Museum: Chatzimanolis was updating the classification of an obscure group of beetles and \u2013 as taxonomists often do \u2013 had asked to borrow some specimens. \nThe beetles had been collected long ago but never formally described. They were just roughly classified as members of the same genus, Trigonopselaphus . But when Chatzimanolis opened the box, he could see that one of the 24 specimens clearly didn\u2019t fit in. Long-bodied, with a segmented, sinuous abdomen, it was much larger than the others and had a distinctive, iridescent head. \nAs he read the beetle\u2019s yellowed, handwritten label, he realised the specimen had been collected in 1832 in Argentina by Charles Darwin during the voyage of the Beagle. Somehow it had never been described. It was stored away unnamed, then disappeared into the museum\u2019s vast beetle collection. Finally, after 180 years in limbo, Chatzimanolis gave it a name: Darwinilus sedarisi , in honour of Darwin and the writer David Sedaris, whose audiobooks he listened to while writing the description in his office at the University of Tennessee. \nThe rediscovery of Darwin\u2019s long-lost beetle was a remarkable stroke of fortune, but the wider story \u2013 of a new species being found in a museum collection \u2013 is surprisingly common. More than 1000 new beetle species are described each year from the Natural History Museum\u2019s collection alone. To continue reading this premium article, subscribe for unlimited access.

For decades, we have recognised five devastating mass extinctions that punctuate the last half-billion years of evolution. But now two geologists are controversially arguing that the end-Triassic extinction \u2013 often described as the third largest \u2013 has no place on that list. \n\u201cCertainly there was an environmental crisis, but it\u2019s not a mass extinction per se,\u201d says Lawrence Tanner at Le Moyne College at Syracuse, New York. \u201cIt\u2019s misleading to continue to call it one.\u201d If he is correct, our understanding of the early evolution of dinosaurs will need rewriting. Advertisement \nThe end-Triassic extinction of 201 million years ago is less famous than those before and after. The end-Permian \u201cmother of all mass extinctions\u201d 252 million years ago nearly obliterated all complex life, while the extinction at the close of the Cretaceous 66 million years ago is famous because it wiped out all dinosaurs, apart from birds . \nThe end-Triassic extinction has been linked to a spate of volcanic eruptions around the birth of the central Atlantic Ocean. This \u201ccentral Atlantic magmatic province\u201d (CAMP) released carbon dioxide and sulphurous compounds into the atmosphere \u2013 supposedly triggering global warming, acid rain and widespread extinctions on land and at sea. Rewriting the story \n\u201cIf you look closely you see there\u2019s more subtlety to it,\u201d says Tanner. He and his colleague Spencer Lucas at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque agree there was ecological upheaval. But they say it took tens of millions of years, so can\u2019t all be linked to the CAMP eruptions. \n\u201cThere is no single extinction at the end of the Triassic,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cThere\u2019s a series of extinctions.\u201d \nIn other words it was all a bit fuzzy. In the sea, shelled animals like bivalves and ammonites suffered. \u201cBut those bivalve extinctions are really spread out, and the big extinctions in ammonites occur 4 to 5 million years before CAMP,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cSomething else is at work there.\u201d \nOn land, the cataclysm is thought to have wiped out many early reptiles, leaving space for the rise of gigantic dinosaurs in the next geological period, the Jurassic. Many of the most famous species, like Stegosaurus and Diplodocus , only appeared in the Jurassic. \n\u201cNonsense,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cThe dinosaurs were already diversifying. There are big meat-eating dinosaurs in the late Triassic. We know them from their footprints and from their bones.\u201d One extinction or many? \nThe researchers will argue their case at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Seattle, Washington later this month. However, they may find it tough to convince other geologists. \n\u201cThere are few advocates of this viewpoint,\u201d says Paul Wignall at the University of Leeds, UK. \u201cIn the sea the mass extinction is clear-cut and substantial. There were precursor losses around 5 million years earlier, but the [end-Triassic] marine extinction is huge.\u201d \nWhile there were several extinctions in the Triassic, \u201cthe end-Triassic extinction is still the biggest thing around,\u201d agrees Paul Olsen at Columbia University in Palisades, New York. \u201cIt sees the complete or near-complete elimination of groups that were dominant beforehand.\u201d \nBut Olsen also says Tanner and Lucas have valid points. For instance, Lucas has argued that the way geologists process data can give a false impression of large, catastrophic extinctions . If species disappear during a geological stage \u2013 which can last several million years \u2013 geologists often lump those extinctions together as occurring at the end. This \u201cmagnifies the apparent severity of extinction,\u201d says Olsen. A matter of timing \nOlsen thinks the precise timing of the extinction is the key issue. \nRecent studies suggest the extinction actually happened slightly before the end of the Triassic, not right at the end as previously thought. Olsen concedes Lucas and Tanner\u2019s point that large dinosaurs made an appearance in the Triassic, but he says they only did so in the time between the mass extinction and the Triassic\u2019s actual end. This implies that the existing story \u2013 that the mass extinction \u201cunleashed\u201d the evolution of dinosaurs \u2013 still holds. \nHowever, Lucas rejects this, saying large dinosaur-like footprints are known from before the extinction . \nOther researchers are open to downgrading the extinction. \n\u201cClearly something happened to vegetation at the end of the Triassic period,\u201d particularly near the CAMP eruptions , says Chris Cleal at the National Museum Wales in Cardiff, UK, who has studied late Triassic plants . \u201cHowever, it certainly didn\u2019t have a fundamental effect on the overall trajectory of vegetation history. Very few plant families became extinct at this time. For me a true mass extinction should be a mass extinction for all groups, not just a few selected groups.\u201d \nMore on these topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T16:16:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2b3ad5f16edb32bb3c69665a64cc1c7d237c1a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX2eCsVecVH5.v0BtcDyZ9PtIWwFPzKqmLPoZ0Qt_5y7FqQKEAw3TPq8p6MovwW5NcN4bQMooDebDTGu7g1t9ujHKIeiZkROmPg--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/health", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Why our \u2018freakish\u2019 galaxy has got cosmologists seriously worried", "title_full": "Why our \u2018freakish\u2019 galaxy has got cosmologists seriously worried", "published": "2017-10-19T16:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/19131948/eso0934a.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 512, "comments": 0, "shares": 512}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2b3ad5f16edb32bb3c69665a64cc1c7d237c1a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX2eCsVecVH5.v0BtcDyZ9PtIWwFPzKqmLPoZ0Qt_5y7FqQKEAw3TPq8p6MovwW5NcN4bQMooDebDTGu7g1t9ujHKIeiZkROmPg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T16:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why our \u2018freakish\u2019 galaxy has got cosmologists seriously worried", "text": "19 October 2017 Why our \u2018freakish\u2019 galaxy has got cosmologists seriously worried In the grand club of galaxies, the Milky Way is increasingly looking like an outlier.

Now it seems this feeling of interspecies connection is real: dogs can smell your emotional state, and adopt your emotions as their own. \nScience had already shown that dogs can see and hear the signs of human emotions, says Biagio D\u2019Aniello of the University of Naples \u201cFederico II\u201d, Italy. But nobody had studied whether dogs could pick up on olfactory cues from humans. \n\u201cThe role of the olfactory system has been largely underestimated, maybe because our own species is more focused on the visual system,\u201d says D\u2019Aniello. However, dogs\u2019 sense of smell is far superior to ours. Advertisement \nD\u2019Aniello and his colleagues tested whether dogs could sniff out human emotions by smell alone. First, human volunteers watched videos designed to cause fear or happiness, or a neutral response, and the team collected samples of their sweat. \nNext, the researchers presented these odour samples to domestic dogs, and monitored the dogs\u2019 behaviours and heart rates. \nDogs exposed to fear smells showed more signs of stress than those exposed to happy or neutral smells. They also had higher heart rates, and sought more reassurance from their owners and made less social contact with strangers. \nWe\u2019ve always known that dogs collect information about their social partners through different sensory channels to decide how to respond to situations, says M\u00e1rta G\u00e1csi of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest. \u201cHowever, it is not easy to investigate such processes so that we can unfold the mechanisms and separate the channels,\u201d as this study has done, explains G\u00e1csi. Look at my face \nD\u2019Aniello\u2019s study suggests humans can inadvertently hijack their dogs\u2019 emotions by releasing smells. A second study suggests dogs can return the favour, using their expressive faces. \nJuliane Kaminski of the University of Portsmouth, UK, and her colleagues have found that dogs\u2019 faces are most expressive when they know people are looking at them. \nThe researchers introduced dogs to a human who was either looking at them or facing away, and either presenting food or offering nothing. The team analysed how much the dogs\u2019 facial movements varied in the four scenarios. \nThey found that the dogs\u2019 facial expressions varied the most when the person was looking at them. In contrast, Kaminski says there was no sign of a \u201cdinner table effect\u201d, \u201cwhich would predict that dogs try and look super-cute when they want something from the humans.\u201d Puppy-dog eyes \n\u201cThis adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dogs are very sensitive to human attention,\u201d says Kaminski. \nIt\u2019s not clear precisely how dogs visually signal us and how we respond, says Monique Udell of Oregon State University in Corvallis. \u201cThis kind of research is needed to fully understand the bidirectional nature of the human-dog relationship.\u201d \nHowever, there is evidence that we are susceptible to these signals. Kaminski found that when dogs were being watched they often raised their eyebrows in a particular way. This eyebrow raise is known to give shelter dogs a better chance of being rehomed . It may make the dogs\u2019 eyes look \u201csad\u201d or infant-like, creating an empathetic response. \nIt is not clear what role, if any, the domestication of dogs played in the development of these behaviours. It has been suggested that dogs\u2019 striking emotional intelligence towards humans is a product of the thousands of years we have spent with them. \nJournal reference: Animal Cognition , DOI: 10.1007/s10071-017-1139-x \nScientific Reports , DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-12781-x ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gary john norman/getty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "biagio d\u2019aniello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m\u00e1rta g\u00e1csi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaminski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monique udell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d\u2019aniello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juliane kaminski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jake buehler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g\u00e1csi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of portsmouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "e\u00f6tv\u00f6s lor\u00e1nd university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of naples", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "budapest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corvallis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T17:19:12.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "01f8c40593d7a2838c94975b73b3296f3690cad0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX0x99DJwDaSZ3SIf9DMRkXZBzQRnSD3r6bg05LK0xtp5jvaaEaZWpxrRZHRcFaL6kLSX8BbqHn9Sc7XnZLEkpjrEosJvacEKgw--", "site_full": "www.newscientist.com", "site": "newscientist.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.newscientist.com/energy-fuels", "site_categories": ["science", "education", "k_6_educators"], "section_title": "New Scientist - Home", "title": "Steep decline of wasps and other flying nasties is a bad sign", "title_full": "Steep decline of wasps and other flying nasties is a bad sign", "published": "2017-10-19T21:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/19181131/rexfeatures_5441883a.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 10418, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1402, "comments": 0, "shares": 1402}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "01f8c40593d7a2838c94975b73b3296f3690cad0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC38fYq3L49_2QLg4Rd.MIh8BKw7VfcKUX0x99DJwDaSZ3SIf9DMRkXZBzQRnSD3r6bg05LK0xtp5jvaaEaZWpxrRZHRcFaL6kLSX8BbqHn9Sc7XnZLEkpjrEosJvacEKgw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T21:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Steep decline of wasps and other flying nasties is a bad sign", "text": "19 October 2017 Steep decline of wasps and other flying nasties is a bad sign Aphids, midges and wasps are being added to the list of rapidly vanishing insects.

A simple spit test could soon help women find out for themselves if they have the condition. \nEndometriosis is caused by uterus cells moving elsewhere in the body and bleeding in time with a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle . It affects 176 million women worldwide and can cause severe pain as well as infertility . The longer it takes to diagnose the condition, the more scarring takes place. \n\u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable that, for many women, those are lost years of excruciating pain, or not knowing why they\u2019re not able to get pregnant,\u201d says Heather Bowerman, a bioengineer and CEO of DotLab , in San Francisco. \nPart of the problem is that doctors don\u2019t always realise when a woman\u2019s menstrual pains are worse than what is normally expected for a period. But diagnosis is also delayed by the fact that the condition can only be conclusively diagnosed by surgery. \n\u201cThe main thing that is so frustrating is the time to get a diagnosis,\u201d says Kaye Sedgwick-Jones, who lives in Kent, UK, and has experienced endometriosis symptoms for 22 years, since the age of 14. \u201cAnything to bring that down, so other women don\u2019t have to go through what I went through, is a positive step.\u201d Towards a test \nTwo diagnostic tests, made by DotLab, might change that.

Territorial songbirds in New Zealand reacted more aggressively towards males encroaching on their territory if those rivals sang more complicated songs. The tui birds perceived these snappy singers as greater territorial threats than their simpler singing counterparts. \nBirdsong has two main functions: defending a territory and attracting a mate , says Samuel Hill at Massey University in Auckland, New Zealand. For tui ( Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae ), territory defence is a key concern. \u201cThere are flowering and fruiting trees year round in New Zealand, so the tui always have resources to defend,\u201d says Hill. This explains why \u201cthey natter all year round\u201d. \nWarbling away takes lots of energy, so males may be showing off their physical endurance to females. Long and complicated songs may also be a sign of skill, as to sing them birds must use superfast vocal muscles to control rapid acoustic changes. Advertisement \nIn other songbirds, like zebra finches, females prefer males that sing harder songs. This hasn\u2019t been tested in tui, but Hill says the complexity of a male\u2019s song is probably a proxy for more relevant measures of his quality, like body condition and cognitive ability. Don\u2019t sing at me, bro \nIf that is so, Hill reasoned, breeding male tui would take umbrage at potential rivals singing at the edge of their territory, particularly if their songs were complex and they were therefore strong competitors. \nTo test males\u2019 reactions, Hill and his colleagues studied 12 tui territories in Tawharanui Regional Park , north of Auckland. Using a speaker, they played simple and complex tui songs, and a control song from another species, for three minutes on the periphery of each territory. The complex songs were nearly twice the length of the simple songs, with more than twice as many total syllables and types of syllables. \nAfter complex songs, male tui approached the speaker more rapidly. They also got closer: on average 0.3 metres away, compared with nearly 6.3m for simple songs. In addition, males responded to complex songs with more complex songs of their own: their responses used a wider range of \u201csyllables\u201d and went on for longer. \nSongirds are known to be sensitive to what others are singing , but Hill\u2019s study may be the first to show a direct link between song complexity and aggressive responses in territorial males, says Kazuhara Sasahara at Nagoya University in Japan.
