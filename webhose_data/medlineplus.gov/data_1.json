But for people with compromised immune systems, campylobacter infections can be life-threatening, she added. \nMost cases in humans occur from eating raw or undercooked chicken, or eating foods that have been cross-contaminated by infected poultry products, Jan noted. \nHowever, humans can get infected from contact with the stool of an infected puppy, she added. \nMany of the people sickened in this outbreak were Petland employees, while others had either bought a Petland puppy, shopped at Petland or visited someone who had purchased a puppy from Petland, the CDC said. \nInfected dogs may or may not show signs of illness, such as diarrhea, vomiting or a fever, so it's important to take precautions when around dogs, the CDC says. \nTo prevent catching campylobacter from dogs, the CDC advises that you: Wash your hands thoroughly after touching dogs, their poop, or their food. Take extra care that children wash their hands carefully after playing with puppies or dogs. Pick up and dispose of dog poop, especially in areas where children might play. Contact your veterinarian if you notice any signs of illness in your puppy or dog. \nSOURCES: Sophia Jan, M.D., director, general pediatrics, Cohen Children's Medical Center, New Hyde Park, N.Y.; U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, news releases, Sept. 11 and Oct. 3, 2017 HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophia jan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "puppy poop infections now affecting", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cohen children's medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hyde park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cohen children's medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:04:34.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b7fc6ccc5667a3f87362427e25de2239e830251", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0TVwH3lZCtmcao6WhVHBz1c-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Blood Thinners Can Come with Dangerous Side Effects", "title_full": "Blood Thinners Can Come with Dangerous Side Effects", "published": "2017-10-03T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b7fc6ccc5667a3f87362427e25de2239e830251", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0TVwH3lZCtmcao6WhVHBz1c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blood Thinners Can Come with Dangerous Side Effects", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168819.html Blood Thinners Can Come With Dangerous Side Effects Newer class of drugs can interact with multiple medications, researchers report   01/01/2018) Tuesday, October 3, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3,   Blood-thinning drugs can save your life by preventing a heart attack or stroke caused by artery-blocking blood clots. \nBut these are powerful drugs, and a pair of new studies detail side effects people need to understand before taking them. \nThe effectiveness of a class of blood thinners called nonvitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) can be significantly altered through interaction with other drugs, the first study reveals. \nIn some cases, these drug interactions increase a person's risk of life-threatening bleeding in locations such as the brain and gastrointestinal tract. In other cases, the NOACs' effectiveness is reduced, robbing patients of some protection against stroke and heart attack. \n\"NOACs alone do not pose a significant risk of bleeding, but the concurrent use of NOACs with certain drugs that share the same metabolic pathways may cause increased risk of major bleeding,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Shang-Hung Chang, an associate professor of cardiology with Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan, Taiwan. \nMeanwhile, a second study found that blood thinners can greatly increase a person's risk of finding blood in their urine. \nAs a result, patients might unnecessarily wind up in the hospital or emergency room, or undergo an unneeded invasive procedure, said senior researcher Dr. Robert Nam. He is a professor of surgery and head of genitourinary oncology with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto. \n\"Patients and physicians need to discuss this, to try and prevent patients having to be hospitalized or come to the emergency room in the middle of the night,\" Nam said. \nThe first study looked at the bleeding risk associated with NOAC drugs dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis). \nThese drugs are primarily used to prevent risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm that can cause blood to pool and clot inside the heart, said Dr. Deepak Bhatt. A spokesman for the American Heart Association, he is also executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital's Heart & Vascular Center in Boston. \nNOACs are being used more frequently because they're easier to use and produce fewer side effects than warfarin, an older anticoagulant that has many food and drug interactions, said Bhatt. \nChang and his colleagues also decided to investigate whether NOACs might have previously unknown interactions with other commonly used medications. The team analyzed health data on 91,330 Taiwanese patients with atrial fibrillation who were prescribed an NOAC. \nThe investigators found that bleeding risk increased significantly when NOACs were used in combination with amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin and phenytoin -- four drugs that treat widely different conditions. \nThe researchers also found that other drugs dampened the effectiveness of NOACs, including atorvastatin, digoxin, and erythromycin or clarithromycin. \nBhatt said he's particularly concerned about the effect of atorvastatin (Lipitor) on NOACs' effectiveness. \n\"That's a very commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering drug, especially now that it's generic,\" Bhatt said. In fact, the researchers found that atorvastatin was the drug most commonly prescribed alongside an NOAC. \n\"That's a big deal because that means all those patients on both drugs have a lower risk of bleeding, but on the flip side then would have a higher risk of stroke,\" Bhatt said. \nThe second study found that people are much more likely to go to the hospital for blood in their urine if they're taking blood thinners. \nNam and his colleagues examined medical data on 2.5 million Ontario residents, including nearly 809,000 who had been prescribed a blood thinner. \nDuring an average follow-up period of 7 years, people on blood thinners were six to 10 times more likely to wind up hospitalized or in the ER complaining of blood in their urine compared with others not taking the drugs, Nam said. \nAlthough blood in urine is alarming and requires investigation, Nam said the side effect is not immediately dangerous. Patients should be informed of the potential for blood in the urine, and counseled what to do if it occurs. \n\"The result of these findings should not affect the decision to treat with these drugs,\" Nam said. \"The benefits outweigh the risks. These are not life-threatening complications. Patients should not stop taking these drugs because of the potential side effect.\" \nIn at least one way, this side effect can be welcome, said Dr. Vincent Bufalino, an AHA spokesman and cardiologist in Naperville, Ill. \n\"Blood thinners can be an advantage because when they cause bleeding in someone on a normal dose, usually there's a medical issue,\" Bufalino said. \"It actually helps you uncover a problem.\" \nThe researchers found that rates of bladder cancer detection were twice as high in people taking blood thinners compared to the general population. The drugs made the tumor produce more blood, Nam said. \n\"Because it bled, they went in, looked, and found the bladder cancer and were able to get it earlier than would have happened waiting for a patient to develop symptoms on their own,\" Bufalino said. \"In many of these circumstances, the cancers would have been missed until they were more advanced because the patient wouldn't have known there was a problem.\" \nThe two studies were published in the Oct. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . \nSOURCES: Shang-Hung Chang, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of cardiology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Robert Nam, M.D., professor of surgery and head of genitourinary oncology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Toronto; Deepak Bhatt, M.D., executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs, Brigham and Women's Hospital Heart & Vascular Center, Boston; Vincent Bufalino, M.D., cardiologist, Naperville, Ill.; Oct. 3, 2017, Journal of the American Medical Association HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bufalino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eliquis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert nam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shang-hung chang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deepak bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vincent bufalino", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sunnybrook health sciences center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pradaxa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chang gung memorial hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heart association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brigham and women's hospital heart & vascular center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brigham and women's hospital's heart & vascular center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ill.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naperville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taoyuan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:04:36.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ad17ad7eb89acff07aac2a8e074efcfe8bb1170", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0X5Hvq0aG33r43.2IXso2gw-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives", "title_full": "Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives", "published": "2017-10-03T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ad17ad7eb89acff07aac2a8e074efcfe8bb1170", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0X5Hvq0aG33r43.2IXso2gw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168814.html Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives But advances in care may not have helped black women as much as whites, report finds (*this news item will not be available after 01/01/2018) By Mary Elizabeth Dallas Tuesday, October 3, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- New research finds the number of American women who've lost their lives to breast cancer has fallen precipitously in the past 25 years, with more than 322,000 lives saved in that time. \nOverall, advances in care have led to a 39 percent drop in breast cancer deaths of between 1989 and 2015, according to new research from the American Cancer Society (ACS). \nOne specialist who works with breast cancer patients daily was heartened by the news. \n\"Early screening and better treatments are finally starting to pay off with better outcomes,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \nHowever, the ACS was quick to point out that not every segment of Americans benefited equally. Despite some closure of the racial \"gap\" in breast cancer survival, black women are still more likely to die of the disease than their white peers, the study found. \nEven though the rate of breast cancer diagnosis was slightly lower among black women than whites between 2010 and 2014, over about the same time period, black breast cancer patients were still 42 percent more likely to die of the disease than their white peers. \nAccording to breast cancer specialist Dr. Cynara Coomer, that's probably due to a combination of factors. Black patients are more prone to be affected by aggressive, tough-to-treat breast tumors, she noted. But they also often lack access to the targeted treatments that can best fight these tumors. \nSo, when it comes to surviving breast cancer, \"there remains a disparity between black women and white women across the country,\" said Coomer, who directs the Florina Rusi-Marke Comprehensive Breast Center at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. \nThe vast majority of breast cancers are diagnosed among women aged 50 and older, the ACS found, and older women account for most deaths from the disease as well. \nStill, race seemed to play a role here, as well. The median age of diagnosis for women overall in the United States is 62, but the disease tends to strike black women at a younger age, the report showed. \nThe median age for breast cancer deaths is 68, but black patients died younger -- at 62, on average. \nAll of this means that, overall, breast cancer kills more black women than white women in the United States. \nThere was reason to hope, however, because this health disparity may be stabilizing in some parts of the country, the ACS said. For example, breast cancer death rates among black women ranged from 22 percent in Nevada to 66 percent in Louisiana, the report found. \nBut in seven states the researchers saw no significant difference in death rates between black and white patients -- showing that the racial gap can be closed. \nWhile genetics and differences in overall health play a big role in the survival gap between blacks and whites, so do \"social and structural factors,\" said Carol DeSantis, of the ACS's surveillance and health services research branch. \n\"Increasing access to health care to low-income populations\" might shrink this racial gap even further across the country, she explained. \nCoomer agreed, saying that black women with aggressive tumors, in particular, \"would be better served with health care teams or centers that provide comprehensive breast treatment.\" \nAccording to Bernik, progress is being made. \n\"The fact that we are finally seeing a close in the gap between our excellent outcomes between black and white women is also encouraging,\" she said, \"especially since black women are more likely to be diagnosed with the more aggressive triple-negative breast cancers.\" \nExcluding skin cancers, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American women, trailing only lung cancer. It's estimated that 252,710 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and 40,610 will die from the disease. \nThe research was published Oct. 3 in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Breast Cancer Facts & Figures . \nSOURCE: Stephanie Bernik, M.D., chief, surgical oncology, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York City; Cynara L.

The awareness of some cancers being associated with obesity and overweight is not yet widespread,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC deputy director, said during a midday media briefing. \nThe 13 cancers include: brain cancer; multiple myeloma; cancer of the esophagus; postmenopausal breast cancer; cancers of the thyroid, gallbladder, stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney, ovaries, uterus and colon, the researchers said. \nSpeaking at the news conference, Dr. Lisa Richardson, director of CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, said early evidence indicates that losing weight can lower the risk for some cancers. \nAccording to the new report from the CDC and the U.S. National Cancer Institute, these 13 obesity-related cancers made up about 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States in 2014. \nAlthough the rate of new cancer cases has decreased since the 1990s, increases in overweight and obesity-related cancers are likely slowing this progress, the researchers said. \nOf the 630,000 Americans diagnosed with a cancer associated with overweight or obesity in 2014, about two out of three occurred in adults aged 50 to 74, the researchers found. \nExcluding colon cancer, the rate of obesity-related cancer increased by 7 percent between 2005 and 2014. During the same time, rates of non-obesity-related cancers dropped, the findings showed. \nIn 2013-2014, about two out of three American adults were overweight or obese, according to the report. \nFor the study, researchers analyzed 2014 cancer data from the United States Cancer Statistics report and data from 2005 to 2014. \nKey findings include: Of all cancers, 55 percent in women and 24 percent in men were associated with overweight and obesity. Blacks and whites had higher rates of weight-related cancer than other racial or ethnic groups. Black men and American Indian/Alaska Native men had higher rates of cancer than white men. Cancers linked to obesity increased 7 percent between 2005 and 2014, but colon cancer decreased 23 percent. Screening for colon cancer is most likely the reason for that cancer's continued decline, Schuchat said. Cancers not linked to obesity dropped 13 percent. Except for colon cancer, cancers tied to overweight and obesity increased among those younger than 75. \nThe new report was published online Oct. 3 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . \nDr. Farhad Islami is strategic director of cancer surveillance research for the American Cancer Society. \nHe said it's \"important to note that only a fraction of the cancers included in the calculation in this report are actually caused by excess body weight.\" \nAccording to Islami, \"many are attributable to other known risk factors, like smoking, while for many others, the cause is unknown. Obesity is more strongly associated with some cancers than others.\" \nThe World Cancer Research Fund estimates that \"20 percent of all cancers in the United States are caused by a combination of excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol, and poor nutrition. The American Cancer Society is currently doing its own extensive calculation of the numbers and proportions of cancer cases attributable to excess body weight, the results of which will be published soon,\" he said. \nSOURCES: Farhad Islami, M.D., Ph.D., strategic director, cancer surveillance research, American Cancer Society; Oct. 3, 2017, media briefing with Anne Schuchat, M.D., deputy director, and Lisa Richardson, M.D., M.P.H., director, division of cancer prevention and control, both U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Oct. 3, 2017, CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , online HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

But over the past 15 years, the disease has gained a new foothold in the United States, likely due to parents choosing not to vaccinate their children, a new study suggests. \nFrom 2001 to 2015 measles cases in the United States remained very low (less than 1 case per million people), but there's still been a signficant rise, the study found. \nOverall, measles incidence doubled -- from 0.28 per million in 2001 to 0.56 per million in 2015. Infants and young children were hit hardest, and most cases were among the unvaccinated, the research showed. \nThe findings suggest that, \"being unvaccinated rather than failure of vaccine is the main driver of measles spread,\" said lead researcher Nakia Clemmons, an epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe good news is that most parents are still protecting their children from measles by getting them the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, she said. \n\"Thanks to high vaccination rates, measles cases among Americans has remained rare since the disease was eliminated,\" Clemmons said. \nMeasles outbreaks, however, can and do still occur in the United States, she said. \n\"Measles is still commonly transmitted in many parts of the world. Unvaccinated U.S. residents returning from overseas travel and foreign visitors to the U.S. may develop measles and expose people in United States. When measles gets into communities of unvaccinated people, outbreaks are more likely to occur,\" Clemmons said. \nThe best way to protect children against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases is to ensure they are up to date on vaccines, she said. \n\"Getting vaccines at the recommended ages protects children at the earliest age possible from serious vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Clemmons said. \nDr. Paul Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\"The reason measles has come back is not because the virus has mutated. It's not because the vaccine isn't effective. It's because a critical number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children,\" said Offit, who wasn't involved with the study. \nMeasles is now endemic in the United States at a very low level, he said. \"It's now spreading from one American to another.\" \nOffit, however, doesn't expect that measles will reach the epidemic proportions it once had. \"We used to have 3 to 4 million cases a year, 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths a year, he said. \"Measles was a scourge in this country.\" \nSince measles is the most contagious of all the vaccine-preventable diseases, it makes sense it's the disease to come back first. It could be the harbinger of the return of other diseases, Offit said. \"It's the canary in the coal mine,\" he said. \nUsing data from the CDC, the researchers looked at the number of measles cases in the United States that occurred after the disease was nearly eradicated. \nBetween 2001 and 2015, nearly 1,800 cases of measles were reported. People who suffered from the disease were an average of 15 years old and nearly half were girls, the researchers found. \nNearly 70 percent of those who came down with measles were not vaccinated. It was unknown if another 18 percent who contracted measles had been vaccinated or not, Clemmons said. \nAbout 27 percent of measles cases were imported from other countries; the rest were acquired in the United States. \nMeasles was most likely to affect infants ages 6 to 11 months and toddlers 12 to 15 months. The rate of measles started to drop beginning at 16 months, the researchers said. \nThe number of measles cases each year varied between 24 and 658, the study showed. \nOffit said it's not unusual for parents to be wary of vaccines. \nKids are subjected to 26 different vaccinations and as many as five shots at one time to prevent diseases most people don't see and using biological fluids most people don't understand, he said. \n\"It's not surprising there's been pushback. Vaccines are a victim of their own success,\" Offit said. \nThe report was published as a letter in the Oct. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . \nSOURCES: Nakia Clemmons, MPH, epidemiologist, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Paul Offit, M.D., director, Vaccine Education Center, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; Oct. 3, 2017, Journal of the American Medical Association HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Acute episodes of heart failure account for more than 1 million hospitalizations each in the United States and Europe a year. \nSpanish Ministry of Health researchers led by Oscar Miro of Hospital Clinic of Barcelona used 13 factors to assess death risk in these patients. These factors included age, systolic (top number) blood pressure reading, respiratory rate, potassium level, and Barthel index score at admission, which is a scale used to assess mobility and independent daily living. \nThe researchers tested their model in more than 4,700 patients in Spain from 2009 to 2011 and validated them in another group of patients three years later. \nThe assessment was highly accurate in predicting 30-day death risk, the researchers said. This was especially true among the 10 percent of patients at very high risk (about 45 percent) and the 40 percent of patients at low risk (less than 2 percent). \nAbout 9 out of 10 acute heart failure patients visit the ER for their symptoms, but emergency physicians currently don't classify these patients based on death risk, the study team noted. \nThere are several risk scores available, but a more reliable tool is needed, the researchers said. \nThe study results were published Oct. 2 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine . \nSOURCE: Annals of Internal Medicine , news release, Oct. 10, 2017 HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barthel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "annals of internal medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar miro of hospital clinic of barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:04:41.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4556325ce720f47cfe15939c44802fefdb7c670", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0R3q5CRkiguUZOvG5sQY.JA-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Moving Just 1 Hour a Week May Curb Depression Risk", "title_full": "Moving Just 1 Hour a Week May Curb Depression Risk", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4556325ce720f47cfe15939c44802fefdb7c670", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0R3q5CRkiguUZOvG5sQY.JA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Moving Just 1 Hour a Week May Curb Depression Risk", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168820.html Moving Just 1 Hour a Week May Curb Depression Risk Intensity of exercise didn't matter, and benefit leveled off after 2 hours of activity, study finds (*this news item will not be available after 01/01/2018) Tuesday, October 3, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Career couch potatoes, take heart: Just one hour a week of any kind of exercise may lower your long-term risk for depression, new research suggests. \nThe finding comes from a fresh analysis of a Norwegian survey that tracked exercise habits, along with depression and anxiety risk, among nearly 34,000 adults. \nAfter a closer look at the data, a team of British, Australian and Norwegian analysts determined that people who engage in just an hour of exercise per week -- regardless of intensity level -- face a 44 percent lower risk for developing depression over the course of a decade than those who never exercise at all. \n\"The key finding from this study is that doing even a small amount of regular exercise seems to protect adults against future depression,\" said study author Samuel Harvey. \n\"This was not a case of more is better; the vast majority of the mental health benefits of exercise was realized when individuals moved from doing no regular activity to 1 or 2 hours per week,\" Harvey explained. \n\"Also, the mental health benefits were there regardless of the intensity of the physical activity,\" he added. \"There is great evidence that there are many physical health benefits to more regular exercise, but the mental health benefits leveled out after 2 hours.\" \nHarvey is an associate professor with the School of Psychiatry at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia. \"The important point here is that any type of physical activity -- even just walking -- had similar levels of mental health benefits,\" he concluded. \nThe original survey was launched between 1984 and 1986. In that timeframe, participants (who were about 45 years old, on average) underwent physical exams, and filled out lifestyle and medical questionnaires. Mental health assessments were also completed. \nThe Norwegian pollsters conducted a follow-up survey between 1995 and 1997 among roughly two-thirds of the original participants. \nAbout 7 percent of those tracked through 1997 had developed depression, while about 9 percent had developed clinical levels of anxiety, the findings showed. \nExercise did not appear to have any impact on anxiety risk. But investigators found that, regardless of gender or activity intensity, regular exercise lasting at least an hour per week was linked to a lower risk for developing depression over time. \nThe study authors calculated that roughly 12 percent of the depression cases might have been prevented if those who had become depressed had previously routinely engaged in one hour of low-intensity activity a week. \nExercising more than one hour per week did not, however, appear to substantially decrease depression risk even further; the lion's share of the protective impact appeared to max out at the one-hour mark. \nBut as to how and why such a minimal amount of regular exercise might help stave off depression, the study team wrote that \"the bulk of the observed protective effect remains unexplained.\" And the study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and lower risk of depression. \nHarvey and his colleagues reported their observations in the Oct. 3 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry . \nSimon Rego, chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said that \"there are probably many mechanisms at play that could explain how this works. But it doesn't have the same effect on anxiety, so we just don't know yet exactly what's happening.\" \nHowever, Rego added, \"What we do know is that what they've identified is a very low bar of entry. We're talking about just an hour of activity a week. And it doesn't have to be vigorous or intense. You don't need to go out to a spin class or sign up for a running club. This could just be getting people who aren't moving much to just increase their daily walking habit. That's all.\" \nSo, he explained, \"while we don't have all the definitive answers yet, this is a very promising finding because this is something many people may find easy to do.\" \nSOURCES: Samuel Harvey, Ph.D., associate professor, School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, and associate professor, Prince of Wales Hospital's Black Dog Institute, Randwick, Australia; Simon Rego, Psy.D., chief psychologist, Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York City; Oct. 3, 2017, American Journal of Psychiatry HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

That compared with $10,917 for a brand-name prepackaged version of the same medication. \n\"Everyone is talking about how to pay for health care, but few talk about why health care in the United States is so expensive. Uncontrollable drug prices are a major cause of this trend,\" study co-author Andrew Beam said in a Harvard news release. He's an instructor of biomedical informatics. \nThe two medications have the same active ingredients and are clinically interchangeable, according to the research team. \nThe investigators' analysis of costs and pregnancy outcomes among more than 3,800 women treated with the drugs also found no statistically significant difference in the rate of preterm births -- nearly 24 percent in the brand-name group and about 25 percent among women who received the compounded drug. \nThe researchers estimated that the annual cost of treating all medically eligible women with the brand-name version would be more than $1.4 billion, compared with $27.5 million for the compounded version. \n\"This case is emblematic of a systemic disorder that is not unique to one particular drug, class of drugs or manufacturer. There is no transparent and systematic link between the price, or cost, of a drug and its actual value or impact in terms of health and disease,\" said study co-author Isaac Kohane, chair of the biomedical informatics department at Harvard. \nThe researchers acknowledged that mixing drug ingredients to order -- compounding -- carries a slightly higher risk of contamination than mass-production drugs. \nThe study was published Oct. 2 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine . \nSOURCE: Harvard Medical School, news release, Oct. 2, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

The ongoing [Gulf study] is important for shedding light on the potential health impacts associated with an oil spill,\" she said. \nThe study was published online Sept. 15 in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives . \nSOURCE: U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, news release, Sept. 19, 2017 HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "persi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dale sandler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda birnbaum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "deepwater oil cleanup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental health perspectives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. national institute of environmental health sciences", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf of mexico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:04:45.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0f9ad95ed5b2b507d97be35195c534300ce645a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0a8gcw75ppJ_5c0z1n4FKFU-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/topics/heartattack.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "Heart Attack New Links: MedlinePlus RSS Feed", "title": "Surviving Heart Attack Often Means Leaving Job Behind", "title_full": "Surviving Heart Attack Often Means Leaving Job Behind", "published": "2017-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0f9ad95ed5b2b507d97be35195c534300ce645a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0a8gcw75ppJ_5c0z1n4FKFU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Surviving Heart Attack Often Means Leaving Job Behind", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168850.html Surviving Heart Attack Often Means Leaving Job Behind Danish research suggests more support needed for workers   Recovering from a heart attack can be a long, painful process, and now a new study finds that almost one-quarter of those patients who returned to work ultimately left their jobs over the following year. \nThe findings suggest that \"even though patients return to work after a heart attack, they may still require individual adjustments at their workplaces in order to stay employed,\" said study author Dr. Laerke Smedegaard Petersen. She is a graduate student at Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark. \nAn estimated 676,000 people in the United States survive heart attacks each year, according to the American Heart Association. Many survivors are of working age: The average age of heart attack is 65 for men and 72 for women, the association says. \nThe new study examined the medical and work records of over 22,000 patients in Denmark who were employed before suffering heart attacks between 1997 and 2012. \nOf those, 91 percent returned to work within a year. But within a year of going back to work, 24 percent of the patients had left their jobs. That's three times the normal rate of leaving a job, the researchers reported. It's not clear, however, whether the heart attack survivors quit their jobs, or were fired or laid off. \nPatients aged 30 to 39 and 60 to 65, and those who had heart failure, diabetes or depression, were especially likely to leave their jobs. Workers with higher incomes and more education were more likely to stay on the job, the findings showed. \nPetersen said the percentage of heart attack patients who return to work and then leave their jobs may be even higher in the United States. \n\"In Denmark, all citizens have equal access to health care and all patients receive treatment free of charge,\" she explained. \nOne U.S. expert said the findings are sobering. \n\"The study is an important reminder that recovery is often measured in months and years, not just weeks,\" said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. \n\"To understand the impact of a heart attack requires that we fully understand people's roles and function. We should study how best to help people fully resume their prior activities and have the choice as to whether they want to continue working,\" Krumholz explained. \nKarina Davidson, executive director of Columbia University's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, said fatigue and an inability to perform manual labor are some of the reasons why heart attack survivors leave their jobs. \n\"Patients after a heart attack do indeed have a long road to recovery, and cardiac rehabilitation, strong family support and follow-up with their medical care are important components to ensure the best recovery possible,\" she said. \"Returning to work full-time will be realistic for some patients, but not for all.\" \n  Journal of the American Heart Association . \nSOURCES: Laerke Smedegaard Petersen, M.D., graduate student, department of cardiology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark; Harlan Krumholz, professor, Yale University, and director, Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale-New Haven Hospital, Connecticut; Karina Davidson, Ph.D., professor, behavioral medicine in medicine & psychiatry, and executive director, Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, Columbia University, New York City; Oct. 4, 2017, Journal of the American Heart Association , online  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harlan krumholz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krumholz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karina davidson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laerke smedegaard petersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petersen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "center for outcomes research and evaluation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national library of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copenhagen university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for outcomes research and evaluation at yale-new haven hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for behavioral cardiovascular health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university's center for behavioral cardiovascular health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heart association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale-new haven hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T15:53:01.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "705f6bb9244868f5de10d694b56e2dc1dab92fb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0cz7HsvpNn7UVc_Rw2wO_uU-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Uber Can Help Cut Car Crashes, but Not Everywhere", "title_full": "Uber Can Help Cut Car Crashes, but Not Everywhere", "published": "2017-10-05T02:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "705f6bb9244868f5de10d694b56e2dc1dab92fb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0cz7HsvpNn7UVc_Rw2wO_uU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T02:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Uber Can Help Cut Car Crashes, but Not Everywhere", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168841.html Uber Can Help Cut Car Crashes, But Not Everywhere Impact on drunk driving rate varied city to city, study found (*this news item will not be available after 01/03/2018) Thursday, October 5, 2017 \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Use of ride-sharing services such as Uber has prompted a drop in drunk-driving accidents in some American cities, a new report suggests. \nBut access to smartphone-connected drivers doesn't uniformly slash booze-related crashes, researchers found. \n\"Uber seems to affect crashes differently in different cities,\" said study author Christopher Morrison. Those differences may depend on specific local characteristics like public transportation, he and his colleagues reported. \nTo see whether the on-demand car services affect drunk-driving collision rates, Morrison's team looked at car crash histories and Uber availability between 2013 and 2016 in four cities: Reno and Las Vegas, Nev.; Portland, Ore.; and San Antonio, Texas. Uber is the largest ride-sharing business. \n\"Alcohol-involved crashes were reduced by about 60 percent in Portland, Oregon, but not at all in Reno, Nevada,\" said Morrison, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Injury Science Center. \"The surprise was that even where there is a reduction in alcohol-involved crashes, we did not detect any reduction in crashes overall.\" \nWhy that's so isn't clear, Morrison said. \"There could be something offsetting the reduction in alcohol-involved crashes, like an increase in non-alcohol involved crashes. It could also be that the decrease in alcohol-involved crashes is too small to detect within the overall crash rate,\" he said. \nCar crashes are the top cause of fatalities among Americans aged 13 to 25. In 2015 alone, about 6.3 million car crashes took place on American roadways, killing more than 35,000 and injuring more than 2.4 million. Roughly one-third of deadly crashes were fueled by alcohol, the researchers said in background notes. \nThe cities chosen for the new study had similar ride-sharing histories. Uber service was launched, discontinued and eventually reinstated. \nUber resumption was not linked to a drop in the number of serious crashes. Nor was it linked to a drop in total crash-related injuries, the researchers said. \nBut state department of transportation numbers revealed that the number of alcohol-related crashes did drop with resumption of Uber services in Portland and San Antonio. That number did not fall in Reno. \nWhy? \n\"The differences could be due to a wide range of different factors,\" said Morrison. \"One likely explanation is that local populations use public and private transport differently from city to city, and probably also use ride-sharing services differently from city to city.\" \nFor example, Portland has many more public transport options than Reno. People might choose to use these alternatives to private vehicles after having one too many, he said. \nThe upshot is \"the effects of ride-sharing on crashes will differ from city to city, so cities should consider their own local transport conditions when assessing the likely costs or benefits to public health of ride-sharing,\" Morrison said. \n\"It's not enough to look at average effects from other locations and assume they will be repeated within a given city,\" he added. \nStill, accident-prevention experts applauded the potential protective benefits of ride-sharing. \nAmy George, a senior vice president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), said ride-sharing makes it \"easier than ever to make the safe choice to not drink and drive.\" \nMADD supports \"Uber driver partners as the ultimate designated drivers, and how rideshare apps have removed the excuse to drive drunk,\" she added. \nRuss Martin is director of government relations with the Governors Highway Safety Association in Washington, D.C. It's \"not surprising that researchers are having trouble drawing conclusive results on the safety impact given the complexity of studying travel behavior and all of the difficult variables to account for,\" he said. \nAt the same time, Martin said, \"it is not surprising that ride-sharing services are making a difference, as we know that consumers are using these services as the designated driver.\" \nRide-sharing, Martin added, \"can provide a great alternative to drunk driving, and communities looking to leverage this idea should keep all of these various dynamics in mind when designing programs.\" \nThe findings were published Oct. 4 in the American Journal of Epidemiology . \nSOURCES: Christopher Morrison, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow, department of biostatics, epidemiology and informatics, Penn Injury Science Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Amy George, senior vice president of giving, marketing and communications, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Irving, Texas; Russ Martin, director, government relations, Governors Highway Safety Association, Washington, D.C.; Oct. 4, 2017, American Journal of Epidemiology HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

That compared with roughly 73 percent of rituximab patients, according to the report. \nCancer experts said the results, published in the Oct. 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , are a positive step forward. \nBut they do not necessarily mean obinutuzumab is the better choice for all patients, according to Dr. James Armitage, an oncologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, in Omaha. \n\"Obinutuzumab had a modest advantage in progression-free survival,\" said Armitage, who co-wrote an editorial published with the study. \nBut the drug also tended to cause more side effects than rituximab, he pointed out. And no one knows yet whether it will ultimately help patients live longer. \nArmitage said \"reasonable people\" could disagree over which drug option is better. \nIn the United States, more than 72,000 people are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). Follicular lymphoma accounts for roughly 20 percent of those cases. \nFollicular lymphoma is usually slow-growing and responds well to treatment, according to the ACS -- but most patients do eventually relapse. \nHowever, when rituximab became widely available back in 2000, it changed patients' prognosis, according to Armitage. \nThe drug is a lab-engineered antibody that latches onto a particular protein on B cells -- the type of white blood cell affected in follicular lymphoma. It's often used along with chemotherapy to get patients into remission; afterward, it can be used alone, as a longer-term \"maintenance\" therapy to keep the cancer at bay. \nWith that maintenance therapy, research has found, over 87 percent of patients are still alive after six years. \nStill, there's always a hope to do better, Armitage said. \nSo the new trial tested obinutuzumab as an alternative first-line therapy. Like rituximab, the drug is an antibody. It's already approved in the United States to treat follicular lymphoma patients who relapse or do not respond to rituximab. \nFor the study, researchers recruited 1,200 patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma and randomly assigned them to one of two groups. One received chemotherapy plus rituximab, and if they responded, that was followed by rituximab maintenance for up to two years. \nPatients in the other group underwent a similar regimen, but with obinutuzumab. \nMost patients -- around 88 percent -- responded to the treatment, regardless of which antibody therapy was used. But obinutuzumab patients were more likely to be progression-free after three years, the study found. \nDr. Robert Marcus, the lead researcher on the study, said he thinks the results will have an immediate impact on \"real-world\" treatment. \nBased on the data so far, it's \"projected\" that patients on obinutuzumab could typically go more than nine years before seeing a progression, according to Marcus, of King's College Hospital, in London, England. \nThere are downsides, though. Both antibody drugs are given by infusion every couple of months. But obinutuzumab is more likely to cause serious infusion-related problems, including severe allergic reactions. \nThat happened to 59 percent of obinutuzumab patients in the trial, compared to 49 percent of rituximab patients. \nPlus, six patients on the drug developed a second blood cancer, while no patient on rituximab did, according to the report. \n\"That's a concerning finding that should be investigated further,\" Armitage said. \nWhen rituximab came on the scene, he noted, it made such a difference in patients' outlook, \"it changed everything.\" \nWith the newer antibody, though, the possible impact on treatment is tougher to predict, Armitage said. \n\"Incremental improvements are important, but it's less clear what to do with them,\" he explained. \nThe trial was funded by the pharmaceutical company Roche, which markets obinutuzumab under the brand name Gazyva. In August, the company announced it had submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to have the drug approved as a first-line therapy for follicular lymphoma. \nSOURCES: Robert Marcus, M.D., consultant hematologist, King's College Hospital, London, England; James Armitage, M.D., professor, medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha; Oct. 5, 2017, New England Journal of Medicine HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Anything that happens to compromise that is going to compromise the overall health and function of the brain.\" \nBecause of that, it stands to reason that long-term exposure to high blood pressure could leave one more vulnerable to dementia as they enter old age, Gilsanz said. \nGilsanz and her colleagues reviewed the records of more than 5,600 patients of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care system, tracking them from 1996 onward for an average 15 years to see who developed dementia. \nThey found that people with high blood pressure in their 30s did not appear to have any increased risk of dementia. \nBut women who developed high blood pressure in their 40s did have an increased risk of dementia, even after the researchers adjusted for other factors like smoking, diabetes and excess weight. \nHowever, the study did not prove that early high blood pressure caused dementia risk to rise in women, just that there was an association. \nMen did not have a similar risk from high blood pressure in their 40s, but that could be because they were more likely to die before they grew old enough to suffer from dementia, Gilsanz noted. \nOther factors such as genetic differences, lifestyle differences and sex-specific hormones also might separate men and women when it comes to dementia risk associated with high blood pressure, Fargo said. \n\"It's really interesting to see there was an association among women but not men,\" Gilsanz said. \"Given that women have higher rates of dementia than men, understanding why this may be is a large area of interest for us. Future research should really look at sex-specific pathways that might be at play, to disentangle the risk factors for men and women.\" \nFargo said it makes sense that people with long-term exposure to high blood pressure would be more likely to develop dementia. \n\"Your dementia risk is really a lifelong thing,\" Fargo said. \"People think about dementia in late life, because that's when it's common to see the clinical symptoms. But everything that is setting you up for cognitive decline is occurring throughout your life.\" \nBut Fargo sees this as an opportunity, given that high blood pressure can be controlled with medication and lifestyle changes. \n\"These modifiable risk factors are the most powerful weapons we have in our arsenal to fight dementia,\" he said. \"It's a target that is addressable.\" \n  journal Neurology . \nSOURCES: Paola Gilsanz, Sc.D., postdoctoral fellow, Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research, Oakland; Keith Fargo, Ph.D., director, scientific programs and outreach, Alzheimer's Association; Oct. 4, 2017, Neurology  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T19:03:23.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e742b86b7e5e7007d194ced8f62b7d26851936da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0UpqI.JewkTev0CubtMHzR0-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Antibody Injections in Pregnancy Might Shield Fetus from Zika", "title_full": "Antibody Injections in Pregnancy Might Shield Fetus from Zika", "published": "2017-10-04T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e742b86b7e5e7007d194ced8f62b7d26851936da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0UpqI.JewkTev0CubtMHzR0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Antibody Injections in Pregnancy Might Shield Fetus from Zika", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168846.html Antibody Injections in Pregnancy Might Shield Fetus From Zika But experimental treatment only tested in monkeys so far, researchers say   Wednesday,   A new antibody \"cocktail\" promises to provide effective, if temporary, protection against the Zika virus, a new study reports. \nA blend of three potent antibodies completely prevented Zika infection in a group of four lab monkeys, said senior researcher David Watkins, a professor of pathology with the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. \nRegular injections of these antibodies potentially could provide vital protection to pregnant women either living in or traveling to areas where Zika is widespread, Watkins said. \nZika can cause devastating neurological birth defects, including microcephaly, a condition in which the brain and skull are underdeveloped. \n\"I would say if you were to give a woman in the first trimester an injection and then another injection at the middle of the second trimester, that would suffice\" to protect her unborn child from Zika throughout the pregnancy, Watkins said. \nThe new study \"provides important evidence that an antibody-based therapy for Zika is potentially feasible,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \n\"If further studies -- including ones done in humans -- replicate these findings, a preventative antibody cocktail could be constructed and used to temporarily protect those traveling to Zika-prone areas,\" Adalja said. \nThis is not a Zika vaccine, Watkins noted. Vaccines teach the immune system to produce its own antibody protection against a pathogen. \nInstead, this approach belongs to a new wave of immunology called \"passive immunotherapy,\" in which people are injected with pre-made antibodies that provide immediate and direct protection against viruses. \n\"What we're doing here is simply short-cutting the vaccination,\" Watkins said. \nUnfortunately, these antibodies have a short half-life, living only weeks or months in the bloodstream before they wear out. People must receive regular injections of the antibodies to maintain their immunity, since their own immune system never learns how to make the antibodies. \nThe same approach has shown promise in protecting against HIV infection. Two research teams successfully used cloned antibodies to shield monkeys from HIV, according to findings published in the journals Science and Science Translational Medicine in September. \nAntibodies work against Zika and other viruses by blocking their entry into human cells, Watkins said. \n\"These proteins will stick to a virus and prevent it from entering into the cells of that person,\" he said. \"That's critical because a virus can't make copies of itself outside of a cell. It needs to get inside a cell to replicate and spread.\" \nFor this experiment, Watkins and his colleagues collected 91 different antibodies produced by a Zika-infected patient from Colombia. \nThey then selected three specific antibodies that seemed most potent against Zika, and cloned enough copies of the antibodies for use in injections. \nResearchers injected the antibody trio into four lab monkeys, and a day later they were exposed to the Zika virus. None of the monkeys developed Zika infection during three weeks of observation, but four control monkeys exposed to the same strain of Zika did become infected with the virus. \nFurther testing in pregnant primates will be needed before human testing can occur, the researchers said. And animal findings frequently don't produce similar results in humans. \nHowever, Watkins said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" that the antibody cocktail will be safe to both mother and unborn child. \n\"Mothers are full of antibodies already, and we know antibodies cross the placenta to provide protection to the fetus,\" Watkins said. \nThe researchers are currently seeking funding to grow large quantities of the antibodies for further primate and human testing, he said. \nThis approach to immune protection is easier than developing a vaccine and potentially more effective, since individual responses to vaccination can vary, Watkins said. \n\"I think the future of much of medicine will be administration of antibodies for infectious diseases,\" Watkins said. \nThe study appears Oct. 4 in the journal Science Translational Medicine . \nSOURCES: David Watkins, Ph.D., professor, pathology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine; Amesh Adalja, M.D., senior associate, Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security; Oct. 4, 2017, Science Translational Medicine  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T19:03:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a3f4d93b4c5c24c9db81b74b04e5e669d80be122", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0fX7eJ6ywCTxKmJWxSM449A-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Coming Soon: a Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "title_full": "Coming Soon: a Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "published": "2017-10-04T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a3f4d93b4c5c24c9db81b74b04e5e669d80be122", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0fX7eJ6ywCTxKmJWxSM449A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coming Soon: a Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168848.html Coming Soon: A Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs? In the future, identifying which drug works best might take minutes rather than days, research suggests   By Randy Dotinga Wednesday,   Urinary tract infections (UTIs) plague millions of Americans each year. Now, researchers say they've developed a test that can tell in minutes whether or not a particular antibiotic can clear up the problem. \nThe issue is an important one, doctors say, since many of the bacteria behind UTIs have grown resistant to certain antibiotics. And, left untreated, these infections can have serious effects, especially in the frail and elderly. \n\"We live in an era of multidrug-resistant bacteria, so-called 'superbugs' that can cause life-threatening infections,\" said infectious disease specialist Dr. Sunil Sood, who reviewed the new study. \n\"Modern molecular techniques to distinguish bacteria that are resistant from those that are susceptible to common antibiotics could be lifesaving,\" said Sood. He is chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y. \nAccording to the study authors, current urine tests can rapidly spot a UTI, but it can still take days for the exact germs -- and the proper antibiotic to use against them -- to be identified. \nIn the new study, researchers led by Nathan Schoepp, of the California Institute of Technology, developed a new way of analyzing germs in urine samples. Instead of isolating germs and waiting for them to grow, the researchers used a \"DNA amplification\" technique to analyze the bacteria's genome, or \"genetic blueprint.\" \nThe investigators tested the new screen out on 51 urine samples containing either antibiotic-resistant or antibiotic-susceptible strains of bacteria. \nReporting in the Oct. 4 issue of Science Translational Medicine , Schoepp's team said the new test can render results in less than 30 minutes. Those results confirmed that urine samples held germs that were either susceptible or resistant to two common antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Furadantin and Macrodantin). \nAccording to the researchers, the test might also prove useful in other areas of treatment of infectious disease. \nSood said that, if this work pans out, it could be a real advance in care. \n\"The technique used by Schoepp and colleagues has the potential to identify such bacteria within the time frame of an office or emergency room visit,\" he explained. \"If further developed, this method could help doctors to more rapidly treat infections with the right antibiotics.\" \nDr. Howard Selinger directs family medicine at Quinnipiac University's Frank D. Netter MD School of Medicine in Hamden, Conn. He agreed that the new test could speed care, but said cost is a concern, too. \n\"We must demonstrate that directed therapy delivers better value, by improving quality and lowering overall cost,\" Selinger said. \"This will allow for insurance coverage and not cause patients to bear the brunt of the cost of this new technology.\" \nSOURCES: Sunil Sood, M.D., chairman, pediatrics, Northwell Health's Southside Hospital, Bay Shore, N.Y.; Howard Selinger, M.D., chair, family medicine, Frank H.

Sun of the JC School of Public Health and Primary Care at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. \nThe investigators reported their findings in the Oct. 4 issue of Obesity Reviews . \nAccording to the International Labour Organization, any schedule that requires working between midnight and 5 a.m. is considered night-shift work. \nThe review revealed that workers who are permanently assigned to overnight work are particularly prone to accumulating excess weight, compared with those who alternate between day and night shifts. \nThe report also suggested that the longer a worker engages in regular night-shift work, the higher the risk for gaining weight. In addition, abdominal obesity risk was specifically found to shoot up by 35 percent among those who routinely work nights. \nThat particular finding could ring public health alarm bells, given that abdominal fat has long been associated with metabolic syndrome. The syndrome includes high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels, and it drives up the risk for developing heart disease, diabetes and stroke. \nWhat's more, less than 3 percent of these workers adapted their sleep schedules to accommodate night-time work, suggesting that many were likely not getting a sufficient amount of sleep on a routine basis. \n\"This [has] an impact on the circadian rhythm,\" said Diekman, referring to everyone's natural 24-hour internal sleep clock. \nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation, wakefulness naturally hits its lowest point between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., at the center of a standard night shift. \nNight shifts also challenge a worker's ability to access good food and exercise regularly, noted Kris-Etherton. \nOne solution, she said, is to \"bring healthy foods and snacks to the workplace to eat.\" \nAdvanced planning is key, agreed Diekman. \"Preparing dishes ahead of time is an easy way to have better options,\" she said. \n\"If your workplace does not offer good options or if you only have vending machines, think about better food choices that you could carry, and then how those choices can pair with what is available onsite,\" Diekman suggested. \n\"And, of course, remember that if you can get more movement into your workday it will help you with energy levels and possibly weight,\" Diekman added. \nSOURCES: Connie Diekman, M.Ed., R.D., director, university nutrition, Washington University, St. Louis, and past president, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics; Penny Kris-Etherton, Ph.D., R.D., professor, nutrition, department of nutritional sciences, Penn State University, University Park, Pa.; Oct. 4, 2017, Obesity Reviews  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T19:03:28.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "567a644abfed971f6b815797ae508d8effcd4a13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0S2x46OUN.q9KfJLwodqQIc-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "'Sleep Positioners' a Danger to Baby: FDA", "title_full": "'Sleep Positioners' a Danger to Baby: FDA", "published": "2017-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "567a644abfed971f6b815797ae508d8effcd4a13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0S2x46OUN.q9KfJLwodqQIc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Sleep Positioners' a Danger to Baby: FDA", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168851.html 'Sleep Positioners' a Danger to Baby: FDA Infants should always be put to sleep on their back on a firm, bare surface (*this news item will not be available after 01/02/2018) By Mary Elizabeth Dallas Wednesday, October 4, 2017 \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Infants should be put to sleep on their backs on a firm, empty surface and never placed on a sleep positioner, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says. \nThe agency warned parents and caregivers that these products, also known as \"nests\" or \"anti-roll\" supports, can prevent babies from breathing. \nThe two most common sleep positioners include two raised pillows or \"bolsters\" attached to a mat. Babies younger than 6 months old are placed on the mat between the pillows to keep them in a specific position while they are sleeping. \nBut putting babies to sleep on or near soft objects, such as positioners, toys, pillows and loose bedding, increases the risk for accidental suffocation and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the American Academy of Pediatrics says. \nSome babies have been found in dangerous positions next to a positioner they had been placed in for sleeping. Federal officials also reported that infants have died after being placed in one of these products. In most cases, the infants got out of position, rolled onto their stomachs and suffocated, the FDA explained. \nThe agency urged parents and caregivers to always put babies on their back for naps and when they go to sleep at night. \nBabies should never sleep with a positioner, pillow, blanket, sheets, a comforter or a quilt, the FDA advised. \nInfants' sleeping surfaces should be bare and free of any loose items. Appropriate clothing keeps babies warm enough while they are sleeping. \nThe FDA regulates baby products that claim to cure, treat, prevent or reduce a disease or condition. Some sleep positioner companies claim that their products prevent SIDS. But the FDA noted it has never cleared an infant sleep positioner that promises to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS since there is no scientific evidence to back up this claim. \nSome companies market their products as helpful for easing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition that causes stomach acids to back up into the esophagus. Others suggest their positioners help prevent flat head syndrome (plagiocephaly), a deformation caused by pressure on one part of the skull. \nBut while some products were previously approved for GERD and flat head syndrome, the FDA asked these companies to stop marketing these items since the risks associated with their use outweighed any possible benefits. \nEvery year about 4,000 infants die unexpectedly while sleeping due to suffocation, SIDS or another unknown cause, according to the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. \nThe FDA urged parents and caregivers to talk to their child's doctor if they have questions about putting babies to sleep safely. \nSOURCE: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, news release, Oct. 3, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Treatment-related worries might make you feel sick (*this news item will not be available after 01/03/2018) Thursday, October 5, 2017 \nTHURSDAY, Oct. 5, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Pricey drugs may make people more vulnerable to perceiving side effects, a new study suggests -- and the phenomenon is not just \"in their heads.\" \nThe study delved into the so-called \"nocebo effect.\" It's the negative version of the well-known placebo effect, where people feel better after receiving a therapy because they expected good things. \nWith the nocebo effect, patients' worries over treatment side effects make them feel sick. \nIn this study, researchers found that people were more likely to report painful side effects from a fake drug when told it was expensive. \nBut it wasn't just something people were \"making up.\" Using brain imaging, the researchers traced the phenomenon to specific activity patterns in the brain and spine. \n\"These findings are a strong argument against the perception of placebo and nocebo effects as being only 'fake' effects -- created purely by imagination or delusions of the patient,\" said lead researcher Alexandra Tinnermann. She is with the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, in Germany. \nDr. Luana Colloca, a researcher at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, agreed. \n\"This is not merely a reflection of people's biases,\" said Colloca, who wrote an editorial published with the study. \n\"Expectations do modulate symptoms and patients' responses to treatment,\" she said. \nFor the study, Tinnermann's team recruited 49 healthy volunteers and randomly assigned them to test one of two itch-relieving \"medical creams.\" \nIn reality, both creams were identical and contained no active ingredients. However, people in both groups were told that the products could have the side effect of making the skin more sensitive to pain. \nThere was only one apparent difference between the two phony creams: One came in fancy packing with a high price tag; the other was cheap. \nAfter participants applied the creams to their forearms, the researchers had them undergo a standard test that measured their tolerance for heat-induced pain. \nIt turned out that people who'd used the expensive cream were more sensitive to pain during the tests. On average, their pain rating hovered around a 15 -- within the \"mild\" pain range -- whereas people using the cheap cream barely registered any discomfort. \nIt's likely, Tinnermann said, that people expect a pricey medication to be potent -- which could also make them expect more side effects. \nColloca agreed. We are all \"vulnerable\" to such outside influences, she said, be it a drug's price or how it's given (by IV versus mouth, for instance). \nHowever, we are not just imagining those placebo or nocebo effects, both researchers noted. \nUsing functional MRI brain scans, Tinnermann's team found specific patterns of nervous system activity in people who had a nocebo response to the pricey cream. \nThat included a change in \"communication\" between certain brain structures and the spinal cord, Tinnermann said. \nAccording to Colloca, research like this can have practical uses. Doctors could, for instance, inform patients that drug prices or other factors can sway their expectations about a treatment's benefits and risks -- and that, in turn, can influence whether they feel better or develop side effects. \nThere is, however, no research into whether that kind of knowledge helps prevent patients from the nocebo effect, Tinnermann said. \nBut, she added, health professionals can be aware that patients' expectations \"play a huge role in medicine\" -- and be mindful of how they talk about a medication and its possible side effects. \nIt's an important matter, Colloca said, because the nocebo effect can cause people to stop taking needed medications. \nColloca pointed to the example of cholesterol-lowering statins. \nThe potential for those medications to cause muscle pain has been widely reported. And one recent study found evidence that this knowledge can make statin users more likely to report muscle pain side effects. \nOther research, Colloca said, has shown that when people stop taking their statins, their risk of heart attack and stroke rises. \nThe new study was published in the Oct. 6 issue of Science . \nSOURCES: Alexandra Tinnermann, M.Sc., University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany; Luana Colloca, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor, anesthesiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore; Oct. 6, 2017, Science HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

It most likely starts in the womb, and the mother's diet during pregnancy might have an influence, DeVilbiss said. \nThomas Frazier is chief science officer of Autism Speaks, an advocacy group. \"The finding of multivitamin use associated with lower risk of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability is consistent with previous studies,\" he said. \nExpectant mothers and women planning to become pregnant should talk with their doctors and follow the physician's recommendations, Frazier said. \nThose trying to conceive \"may benefit from starting multivitamin supplementation before getting pregnant,\" he said. \nHowever, DeVilbiss said it's too early to recommend multivitamins specifically for lowering autism risk. \n\"From a single study, we can't make any definitive statement or policy recommendations, because the results of other studies have been inconsistent,\" she said. \nBecause the study was observational, it's possible that women who take a multivitamin during pregnancy might engage in other healthy behaviors that account for the reduced autism risk, DeVilbiss said. \nIdeally, a trial that randomly assigns women to multivitamins or no supplements could pin down whether vitamins really reduce autism risk, she said. \nFor the study, DeVilbiss and her colleagues collected data on 273,107 mother and child pairs from Stockholm. \nThe children were born between 1996 and 2007 and were followed at least to age 4 and to 15 in some cases. \nMothers reported their use of folic acid, iron and multivitamin supplements at their first prenatal visit. Cases of child autism spectrum disorder were identified using national registers. \nThe research team took into account other factors that might influence the health of mothers and children, and said only multivitamin use appeared to explain the difference in autism cases. \nEvidence that iron or folic acid lowered the risk of autism was not consistent, DeVilbiss said. \nHowever, the study may suffer from several limitations, the researchers said. For one, it was not known which supplements the women took, the timing or the doses. \nEven so, \"pregnant women should take multivitamins,\" said Dr. Ruth Milanaik, director of the neonatal neurodevelopmental follow-up program at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. \n\"In addition, women should continue to take their vitamins after pregnancy while they are breast-feeding,\" said Milanaik, who wasn't involved in the study. \nThe report was published Oct. 4 in the medical journal the BMJ . \nSOURCES: Elizabeth DeVilbiss, Ph.D., department of epidemiology and biostatistics, Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia; Thomas Frazier, Ph.D., chief science officer, Autism Speaks; Ruth Milanaik, D.O., director, neonatal neurodevelopmental follow-up program, Cohen Children's Medical Center, New Hyde Park, N.Y.; Oct. 4, 2017, BMJ HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T18:11:02.215+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2fcee152df79688dde9de0f3d7c409b040ea9d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0UqAnPiNcnNOREzxauyaeDU-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "", "title": "One Type of Dementia Is Especially Costly: MedlinePlus Health News", "title_full": "One Type of Dementia Is Especially Costly: MedlinePlus Health News", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.981, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2fcee152df79688dde9de0f3d7c409b040ea9d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0UqAnPiNcnNOREzxauyaeDU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alan Mozes", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "One Type of Dementia Is Especially Costly: MedlinePlus Health News", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168870.html One Type of Dementia Is Especially Costly Annual bills for this early onset disease twice as high as for Alzheimer's, study says (*this news item will not be available after 01/04/2018) By Alan Mozes Friday, October 6, 2017 \nTHURSDAY, Oct. 5, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A type of early onset dementia known as frontotemporal degeneration appears to take an even more punishing toll on family finances than Alzheimer's disease, a new report suggests. \nFrontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is the most common type of dementia to strike men and women under 60, the study team noted. \nThe investigation revealed that families caring for a patient with FTD face an annual bill of nearly $120,000, on average. That's roughly twice the cost of caring for a senior with Alzheimer's, the researchers said. \n\"For years, we have known about the extraordinary economic burden shouldered by FTD caregivers, but now we have the numbers to prove it,\" said Susan Dickinson, CEO for the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration. \"This study shows that the financial toll of FTD is even more devastating than we imagined.\" \nThe study was led by Dr. James Galvin, of Florida Atlantic University College of Medicine. He and his colleagues surveyed 674 caregivers of patients with this early onset dementia. \nThe research team determined that the patient's young age is largely responsible for the enormously high cost of providing care. On top of rising personal health costs, families also must cope with the loss of the patient's prior income. They said family caregivers often leave their paid jobs as well. \nLooking at patients with this devastating disease, investigators found that the average patient's household income was between $75,000 and $90,000 a year before diagnosis. Those numbers fell to between $50,000 and $59,000 by one year after a diagnosis. \nMaking matters worse, poor financial decisions are a symptom of this type of dementia. Nearly six in 10 caregivers reported that their loved one had made bad choices with money, the research shows. \nThe findings were published online Oct. 4 in Neurology . \nSOURCE: Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration, news release, Oct. 3, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

That means a patient's heart, breathing and circulation stop functioning. Most donated organs come from people who are brain dead, but their circulation is continued with machines. \nOrgans donated by DCD must undergo a controlled cooling process (called \"cold ischemia\") after the organ loses its original blood supply. The organ is then re-warmed when blood supply is renewed at the time of transplant. \nThis process leads to a heightened risk for tissue damage. \nBut a team led by Dr. John Gill of the University of British Columbia and Vancouver's Providence Health Care found that by limiting the cooling process to a period of no more than 12 hours, DCD kidney donations were just as likely to survive once transplanted than those donated following brain death. \nIn a news release, Gill said that in such cases \"the outcomes are generally excellent, and that the use of these organs could probably be safely increased if cold ischemia times are limited.\" \nThe team noted that DCD kidney donations have become more and more common over the last decade or so. While they constituted about 7 percent of all kidney donations back in 2005, by 2015 they accounted for nearly 18 percent. \nThe study was published Oct. 5 in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology . \nSOURCE: Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, news release, Oct. 5, 2017 HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john gill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan mozes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dcd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american society of nephrology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "providence health care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T02:38:30.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5e320a0e8c5abcfdfdcd7dea62d5d20917b3fda3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0ZoGjte1Nmi4Ox8.6d1GkBI-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Is Your Car's Technology Driving You to Distraction?", "title_full": "Is Your Car's Technology Driving You to Distraction?", "published": "2017-10-05T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5e320a0e8c5abcfdfdcd7dea62d5d20917b3fda3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0ZoGjte1Nmi4Ox8.6d1GkBI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Your Car's Technology Driving You to Distraction?", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168879.html Is Your Car's Technology Driving You to Distraction? Dashboard 'infotainment' systems can keep attention off the road for 40 seconds   By Randy Dotinga   A new car's \"infotainment\" screen that allows you to send text messages and navigate with GPS may have been a big selling point. \nBut all that razzle-dazzle may distract you from the road -- sometimes for as long as 40 seconds, a new study reports. \nPrevious research has shown that the risk of a crash doubles when drivers look away from the road for just two seconds. \n\"Some in-vehicle technology can create unsafe situations for drivers on the road by increasing the time they spend with their eyes and attention off the road and hands off the wheel,\" said David Yang, executive director of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, which conducted the study. \n\"When an in-vehicle technology is not properly designed, simple tasks for drivers can become complicated and require more effort from drivers to complete,\" he said in an AAA news release. \nThe foundation asked researchers from the University of Utah to monitor 120 drivers as they drove and used infotainment systems. The drivers were between 21 and 36 years old. They drove 30 new 2017 vehicles, ranging from a Toyota Corolla to a Tesla Model S. \nThe study participants were told to use interactive technologies while driving, such as a voice command or touch screen to send a text message, tune the radio or set a location for navigation. \nNavigation distracted drivers for an average of 40 seconds. The researchers also found that 23 of the systems required high or very high attention from the drivers. \n\"Drivers want technology that is safe and easy to use, but many of the features added to infotainment systems today have resulted in overly complex and sometimes frustrating user experiences for drivers,\" said Marshall Doney, AAA's president and CEO. \nSOURCE: AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, press release, Oct. 5, 2017 HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marshall doney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david yang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randy dotinga", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "toyota corolla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaa foundation for traffic safety", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T02:38:33.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60cc3ab61d913438e0128f8768ff6abb97e534d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0dcoTKNDeB2qsA1FSTckQH4-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Helping Preemies Avoid Unnecessary Antibiotics", "title_full": "Helping Preemies Avoid Unnecessary Antibiotics", "published": "2017-10-05T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60cc3ab61d913438e0128f8768ff6abb97e534d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0dcoTKNDeB2qsA1FSTckQH4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Helping Preemies Avoid Unnecessary Antibiotics", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168871.html Helping Preemies Avoid Unnecessary Antibiotics 3 factors predicted when infant was at low risk of serious infection called sepsis     Researchers say they have identified three criteria that suggest an extremely premature infant has a low risk of developing sepsis, which might allow doctors to spare these babies early exposure to antibiotics. \nSepsis is an infection of the blood, and it's a serious, life-threatening condition. \nBut it isn't always easy to tell if these very small babies are sick due to an infection such as sepsis, or because their tiny bodies are so underdeveloped. \n\"These babies can die very quickly of sepsis, which makes it very difficult to choose who really needs antibiotics,\" said Dr. Rick Stafford, director of neonatology at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Stafford was not involved in the study. \nAt the same time, doctors are trying to reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics, because when antibiotics are given to someone who doesn't need them, it increases the risk of developing bacteria that will resist those antibiotics in the future, Stafford explained. \nRight now, he said, close to 90 percent of extremely premature babies may be exposed to antibiotics in the hospital. \nTo see what factors might help identify babies with a low risk of infection, the researchers considered ways that babies get infections in the first place. Most infections come from the mother's uterus or the vaginal canal, according to the study. \nSo the researchers hypothesized that babies born by cesarean section, whose moms had no signs of uterine infection and who hadn't had their water break, would be at low risk of early onset sepsis. \nThe investigators then looked at a large database of more than 15,000 extremely premature infants born between 22 and 28 weeks of gestation (normal-term babies are born at 39 to 40 weeks). Almost 5,800 (37 percent) of these preemies met the low-risk criteria. \nThe rate of sepsis was 0.5 percent in the low-risk babies and 2.5 percent in the comparison group, the study showed. \n\"Knowing how to use antibiotics properly is something physicians struggle with because antibiotics have their risks and their benefits. But if you're uninfected, you're only getting the risks,\" said study author Dr. Karen Puopolo. She's an associate professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and chief of newborn care at Pennsylvania Hospital. \n\"We found a significant difference in culture-confirmed infections between the low-risk and the comparison group -- about a 70 to 80 percent lower risk,\" Puopolo said. \nWhat's more, the researchers also found that the low-risk babies had a higher risk of certain long-term complications if they were on antibiotics for five or more days. \nLow-risk babies given prolonged antibiotics were more likely to develop serious fungal infections, to develop a serious lung complication, and they even had a higher risk of dying compared to the comparison group. \n\"With all these pieces of evidence, maybe antibiotics aren't always the safest thing to do,\" Puopolo said. \nHowever, both Puopolo and Stafford said it will likely take some time before there's a significant change in practice. \nAnd both said these findings need to be confirmed in other studies. \n\"Antibiotic use is hard to avoid in this population,\" Stafford said. \"But this may get everybody to be much more critical in our thinking.\" \nPuopolo said: \"Ours is not the first dataset to show what we've always believed and what we've always done isn't working as expected. In the end, there were worse health outcomes.\" \nShe suggested that if a baby is low-risk, a doctor could try withholding antibiotics. \n\"It's a decision you can always change two hours later,\" Puopolo pointed out. \nThe study was published online Oct. 5 in Pediatrics . \nSOURCES: Karen Puopolo, M.D., associate professor, pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and chief, newborn care, Pennsylvania Hospital; Rick Stafford, M.D., director, neonatology, Northern Westchester Hospital, Mount Kisco, N.Y.; Oct. 5, 2017, Pediatrics , online HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stafford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puopolo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen puopolo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick stafford", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "children's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern westchester hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mount kisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern westchester hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y. stafford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T02:38:37.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4cf01092c00d13f8ed3a6e0cf85aa7922bbf623d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0bV85j4ISaidBSA13M0GoFE-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Protecting Preemies from Stress Might Improve Later Mental Health", "title_full": "Protecting Preemies from Stress Might Improve Later Mental Health", "published": "2017-10-05T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4cf01092c00d13f8ed3a6e0cf85aa7922bbf623d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0bV85j4ISaidBSA13M0GoFE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Protecting Preemies from Stress Might Improve Later Mental Health", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168872.html Protecting Preemies From Stress Might Improve Later Mental Health Babies born at 2.2 pounds or less normally face higher risk of adult psychological issues   By Alan Mozes   Being born at an extremely low birth weight seems to increase the risk for developing mental health issues as an adult. But that risk can be lowered by lessening exposure to bullying and family stress during childhood and adolescence, new research suggests. \nThis finding concerns premature babies born at 2.2 pounds or less. \n\"We are concerned that being born really small and being exposed to all the stresses associated with preterm birth can lead to an amplification of normal stresses that predispose people to develop depression and anxiety later in life,\" said study author Ryan Van Lieshout. He is an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. \nWith support from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the study team reviewed about 40 years' worth of data. \nThe data provided details on nearly 180 extremely low birth weight children who had been born between 1977 and 1982 and survived into adulthood. Their adult mental health status was compared with that of 145 adults who had been born at a normal weight. \nVan Lieshout and his colleagues noted that prior research has suggested that those born at an extremely low birth weight appear to face a higher than average risk for developing mental illness later in life. \nWhy? The team cited the specific medical burdens that come with caring for a preemie, which often exposes the child to considerable maternal anxiety, depression and familial stress. \nThe study wasn't designed to prove what might cause mental health issues in preemies as they age; it was only found associations. \nBut extra stress in their lives, said researchers, may leave preemies more vulnerable to the kind of bullying that all children and adolescents often confront while growing up. And that vulnerability may in turn raise their risk for developing mental health problems by adulthood. \n\"If we can find meaningful interventions for extremely low birth weight survivors and their parents,\" said Van Lieshout in a university news release, \"we can improve the lives of preterm survivors and potentially prevent the development of depression and anxiety in adulthood.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 3 in The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry . \nSOURCE: McMaster University, news release, Oct. 3, 2017 HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "van lieshout", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan mozes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan van lieshout", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stress might improve later mental health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. national institute of child health and human development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmaster university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal of child psychology and psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canadian institutes of health research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T02:38:39.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7eb1572d69d2b366fad665619ad130fa4641c20c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0XtwkC6dY3g.NqeSjvWbkus-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Gene Therapy May Be Breakthrough for Boys with 'Lorenzo's Oil' Disease", "title_full": "Gene Therapy May Be Breakthrough for Boys with 'Lorenzo's Oil' Disease", "published": "2017-10-05T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7eb1572d69d2b366fad665619ad130fa4641c20c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0XtwkC6dY3g.NqeSjvWbkus-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gene Therapy May Be Breakthrough for Boys with 'Lorenzo's Oil' Disease", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168873.html Gene Therapy May Be Breakthrough for Boys With 'Lorenzo's Oil' Disease In study, treatment put brakes on the deadly neurological illness in most patients for 2 years   By E.J. Mundell   Boys affected by a rare but deadly neurological illness made famous by the movie \"Lorenzo's Oil\" may have new reason to hope, with gene therapy showing long-term promise in a new study. \nThe disease, called adrenoleukodystrophy, affects about one in every 21,000 boys and occurs when boys lack one copy of the X chromosome. This leaves them unable to manufacture a protein that helps break down certain fatty acids. Acid buildup then begins to attack nerves, muscles and the brain. \nMost boys with the disease do not reach adulthood. \nUntil now, the only viable treatment has been a kind of stem cell therapy, but it comes with dangers and only one in five boys with the disease can find a suitable stem cell donor. \nBut the new gene therapy, reported online Oct. 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine , gets around that problem. Doctors remove the boy's own stem cells, genetically alter them in the lab so they now carry the missing gene behind adrenoleukodystrophy, and then inject the altered stem cells back into the patient. \nFifteen of the 17 boys who tried the therapy in the new study are neurologically stable and have no disability two years later, according to a team led by Dr. Florian Eichler, of Harvard Medical School in Boston. All of the boys had a severe form of the disease, affecting the brain. \nWriting in a journal editorial, Dr. Marc Engelen, of Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, said that he believes the treatment \"will have a positive impact on the lives of our patients.\" \n\"For many years, gene therapy has shown great promise, but clinical applications have always seemed just beyond the horizon,\" Engelen wrote. But the new approach \"appears to be poised as a real treatment option for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy,\" he added. \nPaul and Liliana Rojas, of Dover Plains, N.Y., have two sons -- Brian, 7, and Brandon, 10 -- affected by adrenoleukodystrophy. Because the therapy is only effective when used early in the disease, Brian was able to get the treatment while his older brother was not, the couple told the Associated Press . \nAccording to his parents, Brandon appeared to be a typical child until about the age of 7, when he began to drool and experience learning problems at school. His adrenoleukodystrophy diagnosis came three years ago, and at the time doctors advised that Brian get tested, too. \n\"We were driving to one of the Disney parks and had to pull over to get the call,\" Paul Rojas told the AP . \"Once we got off the phone, we both looked at each other and said we need to move forward now and save our younger son any way we can.\" \nThe new treatment is likely to be expensive. According to Engelen, a similar therapy, used for another rare disease, had a price tag over about $1 million per patient. \nAccording to the AP , costs for the boys treated in the study were covered by government grants and the therapy's maker, Bluebird Bio Inc., of Cambridge, Mass. \nAnd not all of the boys benefited, the researchers noted. Two of the 17 boys died -- one from the disease itself, and the other from complications linked to a donor transplant after the boy had withdrawn from the study. \nWill this treatment receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration? Current FDA rules require that outcomes for gene therapy recipients be tracked for 15 years, so the boys in the Boston trial will continue to be monitored. Speaking to the AP , lead researcher Dr. David Williams said that eight more boys are being enrolled into the study as Bluebird seeks approval for the treatment in the United States and Europe. \nAdrenoleukodystrophy first came to public attention with the release of the movie \"Lorenzo's Oil\" in 1992. The film depicted the true-life fight of one couple to develop their own treatment from olive and rapeseed oils to help their son, Lorenzo. While the treatment didn't turn out to be a cure, Lorenzo died in 2008 at age 30, two decades longer than most patients' expected lifespan. \nSOURCES: Oct. 4, 2017, New England Journal of Medicine , online; Associated Press HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lorenz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lorenzo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "engelen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florian eichler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liliana rojas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marc engelen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul rojas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma children's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bluebird bio inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard medical school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england journal of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "e.j. mundell   boys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dover plains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T02:38:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b26b3e0c50b994f8b01d8c8458da4c246961f96e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0ZCTz2S.eEarSwtoF7Km9LA-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Like Your Skin, Your Hair?

Thank Your Neanderthal Ancestors Scientists say DNA from long-extinct species plays role in humans today   By Randy Dotinga   Neanderthals are long gone, but bits of their genetic code help shape the bodies and minds of people today, researchers report. \nThese ancient genes still appear to play a role in determining people's skin tone and hair color, plus characteristics as varied as mood, tendency to smoke, and sleep/wake patterns (\"circadian rhythms\"), the scientists said. \nThe key to these traits in today's humans may lie in how Neanderthals adapted to sun exposure in their home in Eurasia. \n\"Skin and hair color, circadian rhythms and mood are all influenced by light exposure,\" the study authors wrote in the Oct. 5 issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics . \n\"We speculate that their identification in our analysis suggests that sun exposure may have shaped [Neanderthal DNA], and that gene flow into modern humans continues to contribute to variation in these traits today,\" according to Janet Kelso, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, and colleagues. \nAn estimated 2 percent of the DNA in non-African humans comes from Neanderthals, who interbred with early humans. \nThe study authors wanted to understand the \"influence Neanderthal DNA might be having on ordinary variation in people today,\" Kelso said in a journal news release. \nThe investigators analyzed genetic information from about 112,000 participants in the UK Biobank pilot study. The team found evidence that Neanderthal DNA affects the appearance of human skin and hair. \n\"We can now show that it is skin tone, and the ease with which one tans, as well as hair color that are affected,\" Kelso said. \nModern humans from Africa met up with Neanderthals around 100,000 years ago in Eurasia, Kelso said. \nSun exposure in that region of the world probably affected how certain physical features in Neanderthals adapted to ultraviolet radiation, she explained. \nKelso's team said in the news release that they plan to continue to explore Neanderthals' influence on modern-day traits as more data become available. \nSOURCE: American Journal of Human Genetics , news release, Oct. 5, 2017 HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "randy dotinga   neanderthals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet kelso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelso", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "american journal of human genetics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eurasia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T02:38:48.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9eda70f6ed692d93034ebf3d6f48fe9ed660a4f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0WD.S7ux7TsmvlUrj6YzNY4-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Zika Vaccine Works in Early Human Trial", "title_full": "Zika Vaccine Works in Early Human Trial", "published": "2017-10-05T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9eda70f6ed692d93034ebf3d6f48fe9ed660a4f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0WD.S7ux7TsmvlUrj6YzNY4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Zika Vaccine Works in Early Human Trial", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168874.html Zika Vaccine Works in Early Human Trial But study was small, more research is needed   By Mary Elizabeth Dallas   An experimental vaccine for the Zika virus has shown signs of success in an early human trial. \nThe vaccine safely produced Zika-specific antibodies in 100 percent of the people involved in the study. \n\"Zika virus continues to be a threat to people living in the Americas and the Caribbean,\" said study author Dr. Pablo Tebas, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \n\"With these new results, we are one step closer to hopefully finding a way to prevent infection, which can cause serious birth defects and developmental delays in babies born to women who are infected with Zika,\" he said. \nThe synthetic DNA-based Zika vaccine is known as GLS-5700. Unlike some vaccines that use weakened or killed versions of a virus, the experimental Zika vaccine contains synthetic DNA instructions that enable the immune system to neutralize the virus. The vaccine was developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, GeneOne Life Science and The Wistar Institute. \n\"Synthetic DNA vaccines are an ideal approach for emerging infectious diseases like Zika,\" study co-author David Weiner said in a Wistar news release. He's director of the institute's Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center. \nWeiner said this new generation of DNA vaccines has significant advantages. They can be designed and manufactured rapidly. They also appear to be highly predictable for the generation of immunity in humans. \nPlus, these vaccines are more stable than most traditional vaccines, \"making them exceptionally practical to distribute during outbreaks, especially in regions where resources are limited and we need to be able to respond quickly to curb an emerging epidemic,\" Weiner said. \nThe trial included 40 people. It was conducted in 2016 from August to September. The participants were divided into two groups that received two different doses of the vaccine when the study began. \nThe study volunteers received additional doses at four and 12 weeks. Each dosage was delivered with Cellectra, a device that produces small, electric currents that help the body produce an immune response to the vaccine. \nTwo weeks after receiving the final dose of the vaccine, all 40 of the people involved in the study developed Zika-specific antibodies, the study showed. \nThe researchers noted that 80 percent of the participants developed significant protection against the virus. None of the people had a negative reaction to the vaccine. \nBlood collected from the participants was also able to protect mice with weakened immune systems from Zika after they were infected with the virus. \nThis suggests that the antibodies triggered by the vaccine can prevent infection in living organisms. \nThe vaccine will need to be tested in larger trials. \nThe findings were published Oct. 5 in the New England Journal of Medicine . \nThis group of researchers isn't the only one working on Zika protection. Researchers from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine reported Wednesday that they've developed a \"cocktail\" containing three potent antibodies. This cocktail was able to completely prevent Zika infection in a group of four lab monkeys. \nEven if successful in future research trials, it's still only a temporary measure. But it would provide immediate protection.

In this Canadian study, the researchers examined the effect of hockey, taking the pulse of fans during a game using portable monitors. \nWhen the study began, the participants also completed questionnaires about their health and their passion for the sport of hockey. Using this information, the investigators gave each person a \"fan passion score\" to help predict changes in their heart rate in response to a game. \nThe study found that, on average, the heart rate of those who watched the game live more than doubled, increasing by 110 percent. Watching a game on TV had a similar effect, increasing the heart rate of spectators by 75 percent. \nThe effects on the heart were most notable when players either attempted to score or tried to block shots on goal. Peak heart rates were also recorded during overtime, the study authors added. \nThe findings were published Oct. 5 in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology . \n\"Our analysis of elements of the hockey game associated with peak heart rates supports the notion that it is not the outcome of the game that primarily determines the intensity of the emotional stress response, but rather the excitement experienced with viewing high-stakes or high-intensity portions of the game,\" Khairy said in a journal news release. \nOverall, heart rate increased by a median of 92 percent among all the spectators, according to the report. \nThe findings should raise awareness about the potential role that sports-related stressors could play in triggering cardiac events, according to Khairy. \nThe authors of an accompanying journal editorial, Drs. David Waters and Stanley Nattel, said the research should encourage doctors to speak to their heart patients about the risks of watching sports. \nSOURCE: Canadian Journal of Cardiology , news release, Oct. 5, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

People with diabetes don't have enough insulin to cover their bodies' basic needs for the hormone. \nThe researchers thought by mapping the genetic makeup of insulinoma tumors, they might come up with the genomic recipe for regenerating the beta cells that produce insulin. And if they could use that \"recipe\" to make a drug that would trigger the body to make insulin, they could treat -- or possibly even reverse -- diabetes. \nThe study's senior author, Dr. Andrew Stewart, said the researchers have mapped approximately 90 insulinoma tumors at this point, but only 38 were included in the current study. \n\"We have an actual wiring diagram in molecular terms for beta cell replication, and there are different mutation patterns that lead to beta cell regeneration. We've found about 30 different pathways,\" said Stewart. \nHe directs the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \nStewart said it wasn't a complete surprise to see that there were multiple pathways, instead of just one or two. For example, he said, there isn't just one set of molecules that makes growth plates during childhood. \n\"We found many additional pathways... This is a data mine for diabetes researchers,\" he said. \nInsulin, which is made in the pancreas, is used to usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as energy. \nPeople with type 2 diabetes are resistant to the effects of insulin, and may not make enough insulin. About 29 million people in the United States have this type of diabetes, which is associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. \nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to mistakenly destroy insulin-producing beta cells. People with type 1 diabetes must replace that lost insulin through injections or an insulin pump. Approximately 1.25 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. \nWith the information from this new study, the researchers hope to find or develop drugs that could work on one of those newly identified pathways. But it's important that the pathway doesn't have any other serious effects. \nStewart and his colleagues published a study in Nature Medicine in 2015 showing how the drug harmine could prompt beta cell regeneration in the lab and in mice. The pathway linked to harmine was one of the ones found in the current paper, too. \nBut \"harmine is a hallucinogen,\" Stewart said. \nSo, if taken as a pill or given as a shot, it would affect the whole body and produce unwanted side effects. \n\"We still need a way to deliver it specifically to the beta cells,\" said Stewart. \nThere's also a concern that a drug like an insulinoma could cause the body to produce too much insulin, leading to potentially dangerous side effects. \nAndrew Rakeman is assistant vice president of research for JDRF -- formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. \n\"You don't want to replicate the lack of control of an insulinoma. The question is can we find ways to switch these pathways on and then switch them off?\" said Rakeman, who wasn't involved in the new study. \nHe also pointed out that it's important that any drug just targets the beta cells and doesn't encourage cell growth in other areas. \nStewart said a therapy developed from these pathways would likely be for people with type 2 diabetes first. People with type 1 diabetes have the added issue of the autoimmune attack, which could destroy any newly made cells. \nFor people with type 1 diabetes, some sort of immune system suppression might be necessary, Stewart said. Rakeman said it's possible repeated treatments might keep enough beta cells alive to be effective, though that remains to be seen. \nFor now, Stewart and Rakeman said these findings are hopeful. \n\"Amazing things are happening in the world of beta cell regeneration,\" Stewart said. \nRakeman agreed. \"We understand much more about what's happening with beta cells. We can take those lessons and build out therapeutic targets,\" he said. \nThe study was published Oct. 3 in the journal Nature Communications . \nSOURCES: Andrew Stewart, M.D., director, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City; Andrew Rakeman, Ph.D., assistant vice president of research, JDRF; Oct. 3, 2017, Nature Communications HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Some people with the blood sugar disease don't realize they're at risk for flu-related complications. Others have misguided fears that the shot will trigger an adverse reaction, the group explained. \nHowever, people with diabetes are more likely to develop serious flu-related health problems if they get the virus, the AADE cautioned. The group said the flu shot is a safe and effective way to prevent or reduce the severity of these complications. \n\"Reducing risks is one of the AADE's seven key self-care behaviors for managing diabetes, and getting the flu shot every fall is an excellent way of reducing the risk of getting sick,\" certified diabetes educator Evan Sisson said in an AADE news release. \"It's widely available, it takes just a few minutes and it can make a real difference in your health.\" \nGood hand hygiene is another important way to stay healthy and hopefully avoid the flu, the diabetes experts noted. \nThere are several ways a seasonal flu shot can benefit people with diabetes, according to the AADE. They include: Better disease management. The flu and other infections can raise blood sugar levels and disrupt a healthy diet plan. Avoiding the flu can help people with diabetes stay on track and manage the condition. Complication prevention. People with diabetes are more likely to be hospitalized for flu-related complications, such as pneumonia. They are also more likely to die from the flu. Immune system boost. As people age, their immune system weakens. The flu can tax the immune system, increasing the risk for serious complications and even death. A flu shot can help weakened immune systems ward off the flu. People 65 or older should talk to their doctor to see if the high-dose flu vaccine is right for them. \nThe AADE added that people who do get the flu should see their doctor right away and discuss the possibility of taking antiviral drugs, which can help speed recovery. \nSOURCE: American Association of Diabetes Educators, news release, Oct. 2, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Marks is director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \n\"Screening blood donations for the Zika virus is critical to preventing infected donations from entering the U.S. blood supply. Today's approval is the result of a commitment by the manufacturer to work rapidly and collaboratively with the FDA and the blood collection industry to respond to a public health crisis, and ensure the safety of blood in the U.S. and its territories.\" \nZika is spread mainly through mosquitoes carrying the virus. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact or blood transfusions. \nIn August of last year, the FDA advised all states to screen all donated blood and blood products with an experimental screening test accessible under an investigational new drug (IND) application. \nAn IND allows the FDA to authorize use of an experimental drug in emergency situations. The FDA recommended that an experimental Zika screening test be used until an approved test became available. \nSeveral blood collection centers opted to use the cobas Zika test, which is made by Roche Molecular Systems. \nResults from these screenings along with studies conducted by Roche showed the test is an effective way to screen donated blood for the virus. Five different labs found the test accurately identified 99 percent of all infected blood samples. \nZika can cause devastating birth defects in babies whose mothers are infected with the virus while pregnant. The most common of these is microcephaly, a condition in which the baby's head and brain is small and underdeveloped. Thousands of babies in Brazil were born with catastrophic neurological defects linked to the virus when the Zika outbreak there was at its height in 2015 and 2016. \nSOURCE: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, news release, Oct. 5, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Another 23 percent had both breasts removed (a bilateral mastectomy), which is considered the most aggressive option. \nNearly 85 percent of the women had been working full-time prior to their diagnosis. Those who chose a bilateral mastectomy with breast reconstruction were eight times more likely to miss over a month of work than those who underwent a lumpectomy, the study authors reported. \nMissing a month of work had considerable financial consequences.

Body mass index, or BMI, is a measurement of body fat based on height and weight. \nBentham said rates of child and adolescent obesity are accelerating in East, South and Southeast Asia, and continue to increase in other low- and middle-income regions. \nOverall, 50 million girls and 74 million boys are now obese, which sets them up for serious health problems, the researchers said. \nObesity rates were highest (above 30 percent) in some islands in Polynesia, including Nauru and the Cook Islands. Besides the United States and some countries in the Middle East and North Africa, obesity rates of about 20 percent or more were seen in the Caribbean (Bermuda and Puerto Rico). \nThe United States, however, had moved from sixth place to 15th over the four-decade study. Puerto Rico, meanwhile, had climbed up the scale, from 29th to 17th. \nIn addition to the 124 million children considered obese, 213 million youths ages 5 to 19 were overweight around the world in 2016, the researchers said. \n\"The trends show that without serious, concerted action to address obesity ... the health of millions of people will be needlessly placed in great jeopardy, leading to immense human and economic costs to communities,\" said study author Leanne Riley, of the World Health Organization (WHO). \nBut despite the burgeoning obese population, being underweight remains a huge concern in many areas. The study found that 75 million girls and 117 million boys were moderately or severely underweight. Nearly two-thirds of these youngsters were in South Asia. \n\"There is a continued need for policies that enhance food security in low-income countries and households, especially in South Asia,\" said study author Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London. \nEzzati said the transition from underweight to overweight and obesity can happen quickly, referring to an influx of nutrient-poor, high-calorie foods in developing nations. \nThe findings highlight the \"disconnect\" between the global dialogue on overweight and obesity and initiatives focusing on under-nutrition, Ezzati said. \nThe research was led by the WHO and Imperial College London. The investigators relied on information from more than 2,400 prior studies. \nSOURCE: The Lancet , news release, Oct. 10, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay . All rights reserved.

He directs obstetric anesthesia at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \nDr. Jennifer Wu, an ob/gyn who reviewed the new findings, said there are \"important aspects to this study.\" \nUse of \"low-dose epidurals versus placebos during the pushing stage of labor did not increase duration of pushing\" or the need for a C-section, said Wu, who works at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \nAs the study authors explained, epidurals involve a combination of strong painkillers and anesthetics delivered through a tube placed near the nerves of the spine. But since their introduction in the 1970s, epidurals have been thought by some to slow labor once the cervix is completely dilated -- a period known as the second stage of labor. \nWhen this stage of labor is prolonged and the birth of a baby is delayed, the risk for complications also rises. As a result, some doctors may reduce or cease epidural pain management in an attempt to speed up delivery. \nBut do epidurals really prolong labor? Wu said that sometimes it can seem that way to patients. \n\"Patients often cite longer pushing as a reason they are trying to avoid epidural,\" she explained. \"The difficulty for these patients is that there may be many hours of contractions -- and lack of sleep -- before they even get to the second stage or the 'pushing' stage. So, when patients are too numb to push effectively, doctors often cite this as a reason to turn down epidural.\" \nBut, of course, reductions in epidural pain relief can mean more discomfort for the woman, Wu noted. It's a \"delicate balance,\" she said. \nIn the new study, the Boston team compared the effects of low-dose epidural to an ineffective saline solution placebo, both of which were delivered through a catheter. \nThe study involved 400 healthy women delivering their first baby. These first-time mothers received epidurals during the early stage of labor. But once they reached the second stage, they were randomly assigned to receive either the epidural or the placebo, Hess explained. \nThe study was double-blinded, meaning that neither the women nor the doctors knew whether they received the epidural or the saline solution. However, women in extreme, excessive pain were knowingly given pain medication as directed by their doctors. The doctors could also stop epidural pain control at any time. \nDuring the study, the researchers tracked the duration of labor as well as the health and well-being of the women's babies, such as birth weight and blood oxygen levels. The investigators also compared the women's reports of pain and satisfaction with their pain management. \nThe study, published Oct. 10 in Obstetrics & Gynecology , found epidurals had no effect on the duration of the second stage of labor. The anesthesia also had no impact on the rate of normal vaginal deliveries, the number of episiotomies [surgical cuts to ease delivery], the position of the fetus at birth or any other measure used to assess the well-being of a baby during delivery. \nThe duration and outcomes of labor were similar for both groups of women. The second stage of labor was about 52 minutes for women given active pain medication compared to about 51 minutes for women who received saline, the research team noted. \nCiting slow progression of labor, doctors were requested to stop epidural pain control for 38 patients. But the researchers found that this occurred at about the same rate for women receiving the epidural as for women who received the saline. \nOn the other hand, \"twice as many women given the placebo reported lower satisfaction with their pain relief compared to those provided the [epidural] anesthetic,\" Hess said. \nDr. Mitchell Kramer is chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. Reviewing the new study, he said its findings are in line with those of prior studies. But he also agreed with Wu that it's often tough to balance pain relief with the need to avoid numbness during labor. \n\"If there is significant pain block, whereby the patient cannot feel contractions at all or cannot move their legs to assist in the pushing process during the second stage of labor, this may pose a problem during this stage,\" Kramer explained. \n\"Frequently, the amount of anesthetic medication being infused will be decreased, not turned off, to allow some feeling and/or movement to assist in the pushing efforts,\" he said. \nAccording to Kramer, the Boston study shows that epidurals are largely beneficial, so \"we can reassure our patients that we can keep them comfortable and yet not jeopardize or prolong the labor.\" \nSOURCES: Jennifer Wu, M.D., obstetrician/gynecologist, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York City; Mitchell Kramer, M.D., chairman, obstetrics and gynecology, Huntington Hospital, Huntington, N.Y.; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, news release, Oct. 10, 2017 HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "epidu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell kramer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip hess", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary elizabeth dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hess", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kramer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huntington hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national library of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth israel deaconess medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obstetrics & gynecology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenox hill hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T19:12:37.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16a8ee9773b4057902a86affb124f005e1e4a402", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0cK6nRYhVxhpAMNK614tMrU-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Be 'Mindful' of The Hype", "title_full": "Be 'Mindful' of The Hype", "published": "2017-10-10T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16a8ee9773b4057902a86affb124f005e1e4a402", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0cK6nRYhVxhpAMNK614tMrU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Be 'Mindful' of The Hype", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168981.html Be 'Mindful' of the Hype Scientists call for rigorous research to back up mindfulness marketing claims (*this news item will not be available after 01/08/2018) Tuesday, October 10, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 10, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- \"Mindfulness\" is touted as a cure-all for many modern ills, from stress and pain to depression. \nBut little to no scientific evidence backs up most of the health claims surrounding the practice, said Willoughby Britton, director of Brown University's clinical and affective neuroscience laboratory. \nThere's not even an agreed-upon definition of mindfulness that researchers can use to test the concept's effectiveness, Britton said. \n\"Meditation researchers are concerned the exaggerated claims of mindfulness benefits will mislead vulnerable people and keep them from receiving evidence-based treatment,\" Britton said. \nIn a new paper, Britton and 14 other experts say it's time to replace the hype with serious scientific rigor. \nMindfulness has become a billion-dollar industry. Countless practitioners and more than 1,500 smartphone apps promise to help people become calm and focused despite the turbulence surrounding them, Britton said. \nThe idea is based on an obscure Buddhist concept dating back 2,600 years, according to the American Psychological Association. It generally refers to a state of moment-to-moment awareness of existence, without any judgment placed on that awareness -- essentially, living in the moment. \n\"Mindfulness and meditation have been around for thousands of years, and there's good reason from all this history to suspect that there's something going on here that's useful,\" said James Maddux, a professor emeritus of clinical psychology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. \nUnfortunately, mindfulness has exploded into the public consciousness without much scientific back-up, Britton and her colleagues argue. \nA recent evidence review by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that mindfulness-based therapies provided only moderate help in treating anxiety, depression and pain, and did little to reduce stress or improve a person's quality of life, the authors noted. \nThe review found no evidence that mindfulness could help people deal with substance abuse, eating habits, sleep problems and weight control, the researchers said. \nDespite this, Britton believes mindfulness could be helpful, but hype has drowned out any sensible approach to the topic. \n\"There are potentially positive benefits, but they're being eclipsed by market forces,\" Britton said. \"Eventually the hype is going to undermine the real benefits.\" \nMuch research surrounding mindfulness compares the health of people who regularly meditate against those who don't, Britton said. This approach is flawed because benefits attributed to mindfulness could be explained by other factors. For example, people who meditate might exercise more often or eat a healthier diet. \nHowever, even well-designed randomized experiments are not delivering clear results because there's no consensus on what the term mindfulness actually means, Britton said. \nWithout a clear definition, it's impossible to verify positive benefits through replication in follow-up experiments, Maddux said. An agreed-upon definition also is essential for comparing results between studies. \n\"Mindfulness can be a thousand things, and the problem is people throw that term around in all kinds of loose ways without defining it clearly,\" Maddux said. For example, some people have defined mindfulness as simply focusing on something intensely, such as reading a book without distraction or preparing to hit a golf ball. \nMindfulness isn't the only psychological concept that's faced this dilemma, Britton and Maddux noted. \n\"A similar problem happened around the word intelligence. There was no real definition of what intelligence was, but from a marketing perspective you can say hey, this will increase your intelligence,\" Britton said. \nProgress occurred on intelligence research only when scientists broke down the specific thought processes that contribute to intelligence, and designed standardized tests for those processes, Britton and her colleagues said. \nPeople interested in mindfulness should read evidence reviews that evaluate and compare many studies, Britton said. \nConsumers also should keep in mind that mindfulness apps are sold as software intended for entertainment or information purposes, Britton said. They should read the app description carefully, and look for scientific references that back up the claims being made. \nThe new study was published Oct. 10 in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science . \nSOURCES: Willoughby Britton, Ph.D., director, Brown University's Clinical and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory, Providence, R.I.; James Maddux, Ph.D., professor emeritus, clinical psychology, George Mason University, Fairfax, Va.; Oct. 10, 2017, Perspectives on Psychological Science HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

The egg supply dwindles later in life, and the quality of the remaining eggs declines. As a result, Steiner explained, women often want assurance that there's still time to start a family or confirmation that they should freeze their eggs for a future pregnancy. \nThe age at which a woman can no longer conceive varies from person to person. About one-third of couples will have trouble getting pregnant if the female is 35 or older, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. \nLow levels of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are considered indicators of low \"ovarian reserve,\" meaning that a woman has fewer available eggs. That has fueled women's interest in having blood and urine tests done during annual checkups to monitor their fertility. It's also fueled a market for over-the-counter urine tests that measure FHS. \nConsumers may pay well over $100 for FSH testing, depending on where the test is performed and other variables, according to Healthcare Bluebook, which tracks health care cost and quality data. That doesn't include the cost of the physician office visit. A \"fair price\" is about $49, according to the company's consumer website. \nBlood collection and analysis can run from $80 to about $200, Steiner estimated. \nDo-it-yourself test kits also are available. One online retailer listed two urine test sticks for $20. \nBut do blood and urine tests provide an accurate window into a woman's ability to conceive? \nTo find out, Steiner and her colleagues recruited women 30 to 44 years old with no known history or risk factors for infertility who were just starting to try to get pregnant. The investigators took their blood and urine samples and followed them for a year to see whether the women conceived. \nAs expected, AMH levels decreased and FSH levels increased with age. But after accounting for age, women with low ovarian reserve were just as likely to get pregnant as were those with normal values. \nThomas Price, a Duke University obstetrician/gynecologist and president of the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Fertility, said that \"these tests are very good at predicting how many eggs a woman is going to make with injectable fertility drugs.\" \nBut, Steiner added, these tests cannot be recommended as a predictor of natural pregnancy. \n\"Age should really be the driver in their reproductive plans, not these biomarker values,\" she said. \nSOURCES: Anne Steiner, M.D., professor, reproductive endocrinology and fertility, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Thomas Price, M.D., professor, obstetrics and gynecology, division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility, Duke University, Durham, N.C.; American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Washington, D.C.; Oct. 10, 2017, Journal of the American Medical Association HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

It's really a matter of patient preference, they noted. \nOne issue with the pump is price. The start-up cost for a pump can be as much as $5,000, according to Accacha. And there are monthly costs for supplies as well. Insurers, especially Medicaid, sometimes hesitate to pay, both experts said. But studies like this latest one help provide more evidence about the importance of pump therapy. \n\"Pumps are more expensive, but I don't think expense should guide quality of therapy,\" Rapaport said. \"Even though pumps are more expensive, they lead to better results and less complications, so health care costs will even out.\" \nPlus, Accacha said, \"It helps to make kids with diabetes feel more like other kids, and makes them feel a little bit more normal.\" \nType 1 diabetes patients don't make enough insulin, a hormone that helps carry the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as fuel. \nTo replace that lost insulin, patients must either take multiple daily insulin injections or get insulin via a tiny tube inserted temporarily under the skin and attached to an insulin pump. \nNo matter which delivery system a person chooses, getting the dose of insulin right remains a difficult balancing act. Too much insulin can send blood sugar levels dangerously low, which can cause hypoglycemia. Initially, hypoglycemia causes dizziness, a racing heart, sweating and confusion, according to JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). Left untreated, hypoglycemia can cause fainting or seizures. Severe hypoglycemia can cause death. \nToo little insulin causes blood sugar levels to rise. This can cause fatigue, dry mouth, blurry vision and stomach pain. If blood sugar stays too high too long, a complication called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can occur, according to JDRF. This means the body uses fat and body tissue for fuel. This produces toxic acids called ketones. If these are allowed to build up, a diabetic coma can result and possibly lead to death. \nIf blood sugar levels are high, but not high enough to cause DKA, they can contribute to complications in the long run, such as heart disease, serious vision problems and kidney disease. \nThe new study looked at the rates of severe hypoglycemia and DKA, as well as overall blood sugar levels in people aged 20 and younger who used either an insulin pump or multiple daily injections. \nThe children and teens came from 446 diabetes centers in Germany, Austria and Luxembourg. The initial study group included just over 30,000 people with a mean age of 14. The final matched comparison groups included almost 10,000 people on insulin pumps versus 10,000 on shots. \nThe researchers, led by Drs. Joachim Rosenbauer and Reinhard Holl of the German Center for Diabetes Research in Neuherberg, saw a slight improvement in blood sugar control for those on pump therapy over a year of treatment. \nChildren and teens on pumps were less likely to experience severe hypoglycemia and DKA than those on shots. \nRapaport noted that the improvement in DKA wasn't in all age groups. For example, in kids aged 1 to 5, there was no difference. \"But, there was a major difference in adolescents, and that would be very important,\" he said. \nThe study was published Oct. 10 in Journal of the American Medical Association . \nSOURCES: Siham Accacha, M.D., pediatric endocrinologist, NYU Winthrop Hospital, Mineola, N.Y.; Robert Rapaport, M.D., chief, division of pediatric endocrinology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City; Oct. 10, 2017, Journal of the American Medical Association HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

old (*this news item will not be available after 01/08/2018) By Mary Elizabeth Dallas Tuesday, October 10, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 10, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- How to keep from developing skin cancer should be something all doctors discuss with the parents of their young, fair-skinned patients, suggests the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. \nThose conversations should begin much earlier than previously recommended -- starting when a child is just 6 months old, according to new recommendations from the task force. \n\"Providing behavioral counseling to children, their parents and young adults encourages sun-protective behaviors,\" said Karina Davidson, a U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) member. \n\"These actions -- such as using sunscreen, wearing sun-protective clothing and avoiding indoor tanning -- can help prevent skin cancer later in life,\" Davidson explained in a USPSTF news release. \nShe is vice dean at Columbia University Medical Center's departments of medicine, cardiology and psychiatry and director of the Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, in New York City. \nThe task force recommends that doctors with fair-skinned patients aged 6 months to 24 years of age should talk with them, or their parents, about ways to protect skin from sun exposure to reduce the risk for skin cancer. \nFor patients older than 24, the task force suggests that doctors decide case-by-case whether counseling on skin cancer prevention would be appropriate. \nAccording to another task force member, Dr. John Epling, \"Now, there is more evidence that counseling people to practice sun-protective behaviors can benefit some adults with fair skin.\" Epling is a professor of family and community medicine at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine in Roanoke. \nAt this point, the recommendation by the task force, an independent panel of national experts, is considered a draft. It expands on guidelines issued in 2012 that advised doctors to counsel fair-skinned patients aged 10 to 24 years on skin cancer protection. Public comment on the draft will be accepted until Nov. 6, and a final, updated guideline will be issued after that. \nSkin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. \nChildren and teens exposed to the sun's ultraviolet rays are at greater risk for skin cancer later in life, especially those with light skin and freckles who easily burn in the sun, the task force noted. People who've had sunburns in the past, used tanning beds or have had skin cancer also are at greater risk for the disease. \nSOURCE: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, news release, Oct. 10, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

She's a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. \nMultiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system thought to affect more than 2.3 million people worldwide. Symptoms, which often affect movement and vision, can be disabling. \nSince young people with MS have a higher rate of relapse than adults, Waubant and her colleagues wanted to explore the effects of diet on children with the disease. \nFood questionnaires were filled out by 219 young patients treated at 11 different MS centers across the United States. All were diagnosed with the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) before their 18th birthday. CIS is the first episode of neurological symptoms, usually lasting at least 24 hours. Relapsing-remitting MS means patients have attacks, then are symptom-free for periods of time. \nThe researchers analyzed the patients' dietary data and monitored their health for almost two years on average. \nDuring this time, roughly 43 percent suffered a relapse of their disease. \nThe researchers found that every 10 percent increase in calorie intake that came from fat was linked with a 56 percent higher risk of relapse. \nMoreover, most of this risk increase was tied to consumption of saturated fat, found in many baked goods and beef, cheese and butter. Every 10 percent increase in these calories was associated with a tripling of the risk for relapse, according to the study. \nBut every additional cup of vegetables was linked with a 50 percent reduction in risk for relapse, regardless of how much fat the children ate, the study found. This was true even after the researchers considered other possible contributing factors, including age, weight and medication. \nIt's possible that excess fat intake may be triggering the release of inflammatory chemicals and affecting the composition of bacteria in the gut, the researchers said. Animal fat is also associated with a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, while a vegetable-rich diet has the opposite effect, Waubant's team noted. \nThe findings were published online Oct. 9 in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery & Psychiatry . \nThe study doesn't prove a causal relationship, however, and more research is needed to investigate how diet affects MS. \n\"Ultimately, the role of diet in MS is an actively evolving area of research,\" said Dr. Kathryn Fitzgerald, of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. She wrote a commentary accompanying the study. \nSOURCE: BMJ , news release, Oct. 9, 2017 HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waubant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathryn fitzgerald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuelle waubant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary elizabeth dallas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national library of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal of neurology neurosurgery & psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johns hopkins school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baltimore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmj", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T19:12:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a6213bec1b53011a571c2b117413e5c5dfecca7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0cUUqpbKvDe730u_F0qYw4k-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Where There's Type 1 Diabetes, Celiac Disease May Follow", "title_full": "Where There's Type 1 Diabetes, Celiac Disease May Follow", "published": "2017-10-10T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a6213bec1b53011a571c2b117413e5c5dfecca7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0cUUqpbKvDe730u_F0qYw4k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Where There's Type 1 Diabetes, Celiac Disease May Follow", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_168990.html Where There's Type 1 Diabetes, Celiac Disease May Follow Screening for early signs of both conditions should be done at birth, study suggests (*this news item will not be available after 01/08/2018) Tuesday, October 10, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 10, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Parents of young children with type 1 diabetes need to be on the lookout for symptoms of another autoimmune condition -- celiac disease, new research suggests. \nThe study found these youngsters appear to face a nearly tripled risk of developing celiac disease autoantibodies, which eventually can lead to the disorder. \n\"Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease are closely related genetically,\" explained study author Dr. William Hagopian. \n\"People with one disease tend to get the other. People who have type 1 diabetes autoantibodies should get screened for celiac autoantibodies,\" Hagopian said. He directs the diabetes program at the Pacific Northwest Research Institute in Seattle. \nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body's immune system to mistakenly attack the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, according to the American Diabetes Association. Insulin is a hormone that helps to usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as fuel. Because the autoimmune attack leaves people with type 1 diabetes without enough insulin, they must replace the lost insulin through injections or an insulin pump with a temporary tube inserted under the skin. \nCeliac disease is an autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack the lining of the small intestine when gluten is consumed, according to the Celiac Disease Foundation. Gluten is a protein found in wheat. Symptoms of celiac disease include stomach pain and bloating, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, weight loss, fatigue and delayed growth and puberty. \nDr. James Grendell is chief of the division of gastroenterology at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. He explained why knowing ahead of time that celiac may be developing can be helpful. \n\"Early diagnosis of celiac disease is important to initiate treatment with a gluten-free diet to prevent complications, particularly growth retardation in children,\" he said. \n\"Other significant complications include iron-deficiency anemia, osteoporosis and a form of skin rash. Less common, but potentially lethal, complications include lymphoma and carcinoma of the small intestine,\" Grendell added. \nTreatment for the disease is avoiding eating or drinking anything containing gluten. \nAccording to Hagopian, \"Celiac is about three times more common in the general population than type 1 diabetes.\" \nPrevious research has pegged the co-occurrence of type 1 diabetes and celiac disease at around 5 percent to 8 percent, the study authors said. \nTo get a better idea of when these diseases start to occur together, as well as what might trigger them, the researchers looked at data from a prospective study of children with a high genetic risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The primary aim of the study was to find environmental causes of type 1 diabetes. \nThe research included almost 6,000 youngsters from six U.S. and European medical centers. The participants all had the necessary autoantibody testing. The median follow-up time was 66 months (5.5 years), the study said. \nAutoantibodies linked to type 1 diabetes were found in 367 children, according to the report. Autoantibodies linked to celiac disease were found in 808 youngsters. Autoantibodies associated with both conditions were found in 90 children. \nAutoantibodies for type 1 diabetes typically appeared before those for celiac disease, the study authors noted. \nThat doesn't necessarily mean that type 1 diabetes caused the development of celiac autoantibodies, said Dr. Christine Ferrara, an adjunct assistant professor at the University of California, San Francisco. She co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study. \n\"The results of this paper demonstrate an association, but do not establish causation,\" Ferrara said. \nThe findings were published online Oct. 10 in the journal Pediatrics . \nHagopian said it's possible that type 1 diabetes may somehow trigger celiac disease. But it could also be an overlapping environmental factor that starts the disease process in both cases, he added. \nFerrara explained that \"people need to recognize that regulation of the immune system underlies multiple disease processes.\" \nHagopian said it's important to note that the study only looked at children under 6. \nGrendell agreed with Hagopian that a diagnosis of type 1 should signal the need to look for celiac disease. \n\"The take-home message for the public is that type 1 diabetes mellitus appears to be a risk factor for the development of celiac disease and, as already recommended, patients [usually children] diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus should be screened for this highly treatable disease,\" he said. \nSOURCES: William Hagopian, M.D., Ph.D., clinical professor, medicine, University of Washington, and director, diabetes program, Pacific Northwest Research Institute, Seattle; Christine Ferrara, M.D., adjunct assistant professor, University of California, San Francisco; James Grendell, M.D., chief, division of gastroenterology, NYU Winthrop Hospital, Mineola, N.Y. ; Oct. 10, 2017, Pediatrics , online HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

He's the study's lead author and a research fellow at the University of Bristol in England. \n\"What's not been clear is whether this is simply a reflection of healthier and wealthier people getting married or a true protective effect of the marriage itself,\" he added. \nMarriage researcher Dr. Rahul Potluri, a cardiologist with Aston University in Birmingham, England, said that \"the evidence so far suggests that married couples and perhaps happier couples are more inclined to look after each other, which may have a direct impact on cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease.\" \nFor the new study, Bennett-Britton and his colleagues surveyed 620 married fathers about their relationships, and then tracked the men for about 19 years. \n\"We found little change in cardiovascular risk factors for those whose relationships were consistently good or bad,\" Bennett-Britton said. \"But we found a more consistent pattern for those whose relationships had either improved or deteriorated during the study period, with respective improvements and worsening in cardiovascular risk profile.\" \nCompared with men in \"consistently good\" relationships, those whose relationships had improved had slightly lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the so-called \"bad\" type. They also had a slightly lower body mass index, a measurement of body fat based on height and weight, the findings showed. \n\"Weaker links were found with improved total cholesterol and improved blood pressure,\" Bennett-Britton said. \nOn the other hand, the investigators found that men in deteriorating relationships had slightly worse blood pressure than those in stable, good relationships. Their diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number in a reading, was, on average, about 3 points higher. \nThe researchers reached these numbers after adjusting their statistics to account for variable factors, such as wealth and age. \nThough the possible individual impact of the findings may be small, Bennett-Britton said they could add up to quite a gain in the entire population. \nStill, Potluri noted that the number of men in the study was low and their age was on the young side. The men averaged 36 years old when they first began to be tracked. \"The long-term impact of these changes is difficult to ascertain,\" he said. \nWhat impact, if any, marriage ups and downs might have on women was not studied. \nFor men, though, the possible link between the health of their marriage and the health of their heart could have various origins, the study authors suggested. And the study could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. \nPatrick Markey, a psychology professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, said, \"Stress is highly related to physical health, so bad marriages likely cause stress, which causes poor health.\" \nAlso, Markey added, \"especially for men, romantic partners often contribute to our physical health more directly. For example, some research in our lab has found that wives often monitor their husband's eating and are more likely to encourage them to eat in a healthy manner. Similarly, wives also appear to be more likely to encourage their husbands to go to doctors, get flu shots and take medication.\" \nPotluri said another possibility is that worsening health translates to a less happy marriage, and vice versa, but \"certainly more evidence is required to address this.\" \nOne thing is clear, though, Markey said: \"There is little doubt that people in healthy relationships are, on average, much more healthy than those who are single. Being in a happy relationship is likely good for you both psychologically and physically.\" \nThe study was published online Oct. 9 in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health . \nSOURCES: Rahul Potluri, MRCP, cardiologist, Aston University, Birmingham, U.K.; Ian Bennett-Britton, MBChB, research fellow, University of Bristol, U.K.; Patrick Markey, Ph.D., professor of psychology, Villanova University, Penn.; Oct. 9, 2017, Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health , online HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

She is a doctoral candidate in industrial-organizational psychology at the University of Georgia. \n\"The efforts required to hide sexual orientation from a supervisor impact the partner's family satisfaction. The partner being less satisfied at home explains why the partner is in turn experiencing this family interference with their work,\" she said in a university news release. \nThe study included 89 same-sex couples. \nAccording to study co-author Malissa Clark, \"There are many reasons an employee may hide these details about their lives from their co-workers or supervisor, as well as decide who they disclose to and why, all of which are sources of stress.\" \nClark, an assistant professor of psychology, said that both men and women benefited when they disclosed their sexual orientation at work. But men experienced more negative consequences when they weren't fully open about their sexual orientation, she said. \nWilliamson said, \"Our results show why it's important that organizations foster an open culture and allow people of sexual minority status to feel comfortable disclosing their sexual orientation, that it helps not only their own well-being, but that it impacts their partner.\" \nFindings from the study were published online recently in the Journal of Vocational Behavior . \nSOURCE: University of Georgia, news release, September 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

And each episode of binge-drinking in a given month lowered those odds by 1.4 percent. \n\"The study is important because it definitively shows how drinking impacts employment,\" said study author Peter Bamberger. He's research director of Cornell University's Smithers Institute in Ithaca, N.Y. \n\"It's kind of a wake-up call to college students that their behavioral health has long-term implications,\" Bamberger added. \"You can have fun in college, but within limits.\" \nBamberger is also a professor of organizational behavior at Tel Aviv University in Israel. \nBinge drinking is defined slightly differently by gender. For women, it's consuming four or more alcoholic drinks within two hours; for men, it's five or more within two hours. \nPrior research has established how often college students typically drink and some of the habit's effects. According to the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), nearly six in 10 college students aged 18 to 22 drank alcohol in the past month, and nearly two-thirds of them engaged in binge drinking in that time frame. \nAbout one-quarter of college students have reported academic consequences tied to drinking, including lower grades and missed classes, the NIAAA says. \nThe new research was funded by the NIAAA and led by a Cornell consortium. It analyzed data from 827 people who graduated between 2014 and 2016 from four geographically diverse U.S. universities. The students were contacted via email toward the beginning of their final academic semester or quarter, and were screened for graduation status and plans to begin working upon graduation. \nThe participants (61 percent women) took surveys both before graduation and one month after, answering questions about academics, alcohol use and post-graduation full-time employment status, among other factors. \nThe findings also suggest that a student who binge drinks four times a month is 6 percent less likely to find a job upon graduation than a student with different drinking habits. Drinking in moderation didn't negatively affect graduates' job search results, according to the report. \n\"I think a simple awareness of the implications of binge drinking for the student can have a pretty significant effect,\" Bamberger said. \nThe study does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between college binge drinking and a lower chance of landing a job. Bamberger said the data also couldn't establish exactly why the correlation seems to exist. \nBut one \"plausible explanation,\" he said, is that binge drinking adversely affects a graduating student's ability to execute the tasks required to find full-time employment. This may include sending out resumes in a timely manner, performing well on interviews and networking with others. \nDelynne Wilcox and Beth DeRicco are co-chairs of the American College Health Association's Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drugs Coalition. They said they weren't surprised by the study's findings, which they feel could bolster efforts to tackle binge drinking among college students. \n\"It's still hard to make people understand, even though we have all this data, that the alcohol use that occurs deeply affects the relationships young people have, their grade-point averages and their academic success,\" DeRicco said. \n\"So a study like this really helps us,\" she added. \"Having young people really understand that their odds of success change is an important leverage tool we have.\" \nWilcox said parents have an important role to play in warning their young-adult children about the potential consequences of alcohol use and abuse. \n\"Colleges are bound legally by federal regulations to make efforts to prevent binge drinking, and some do it better than others,\" Wilcox said. \"The missing piece that I think is equally important is the parents' component. While parents tend to think they're finished with that once their children graduate from high school, the college needs the parents to still be engaged.\" \nThe study was published online recently in the Journal of Applied Psychology . \nSOURCES: Peter Bamberger, Ph.D., professor, organizational behavior, Tel Aviv University, and research director, Smithers Institute, School of Industrial and Labor Relations, Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y.; Delynne Wilcox, Ph.D., M.P.H., and Beth DeRicco, Ph.D., co-chairs, American College Health Association's Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drugs Coalition, Hanover, Md.; Aug. 24, 2017, Journal of Applied Psychology , online HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

This can lead to poor sleep and ultimately raise a person's risk of health problems such as high blood pressure, heart attack, heart failure, stroke, obesity and diabetes, the FDA said. \nThe condition is different from the more common obstructive sleep apnea, in which breathing disruptions are caused by upper airway obstruction. \n\"Patients should speak with their health care providers about the benefits and risks of this new treatment option compared to other available treatments,\" said Tina Kiang, acting director of the FDA's Division of Anesthesiology, General Hospital, Respiratory, Infection Control and Dental Devices. \nCommon treatments for sleep apnea include medication, positive airway pressure devices or surgery, the agency said. \nThe new system, including a battery pack implanted in the chest, stimulates the phrenic nerve and monitors a person's lung function during sleep, the FDA said. In clinical testing involving more than 140 people, a measure of sleep apnea was reduced by at least half among 51 percent of people who used the system. That compared to an 11 percent reduction among those who didn't have the system implanted. \nThe most common adverse reactions included implant-site infection and swelling near the implant site.

Such infections can sometimes lead to serious complications and even death. \nThe researchers analyzed the medical records of 8,400 patients who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2014 for issues such as hip or knee replacement, hysterectomy, colon surgery and heart bypass. \nMore than 900 had an allergy to penicillin noted in their medical records prior to surgery. \nMore than 200 patients ended up with some type of surgical site infection, the study team found. That included 2.6 percent with no known allergy to penicillin and 3.5 percent of patients who believed they were allergic to the drug and therefore didn't receive it. \nBased on the findings, the study team said prospective surgical patients who believe they are allergic to penicillin should undergo a fresh allergy evaluation in advance of their operation. \nThe findings appear in the Oct. 9 online issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases . \nSOURCE: Massachusetts General Hospital-Harvard Medical School, news release, Oct. 9, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

About 90 percent will make it into adulthood. \nBut a new genetic analysis that involved nearly 2,900 congenital heart disease survivors and their family members revealed that being born with that specific condition appears to be associated with a higher risk for developing other major health problems. \nMany genes already implicated in autism were also associated with congenital heart disease, and the scientists also found new genes that were linked to congenital heart disease in some patients. \nBut the study did not prove that heart defects at birth caused these other illnesses, it just showed an association. \nAlso, the analysis suggested that some respiratory ailments found in patients with congestive heart failure are linked to defects in cilia, the hairlike structures on the surface of cells that carry out many biological functions. \n\"It has been frustrating to see one patient recover nicely and another with the exact same heart defect struggle,\" Brueckner said in a Yale news release. \"This type of study helps us understand why and is a step toward personalized treatment.\" \nThe findings could help with counseling for affected families regarding the risk for recurrence of congestive heart disease, the researchers said. \nBrueckner and her colleagues reported their findings in the Oct. 9 issue of Nature Genetics . \nSOURCE: Yale University School of Medicine, news release, Oct. 9, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

And this is especially concerning in rural areas,\" said CDC director Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald. \n\"We need proven prevention efforts to help stop these deaths and the terrible pain and loss they cause,\" Fitzgerald said in an agency news release. \nBetween 2001 and 2015, more than 500,000 people took their own lives in the United States. Rates in rural areas were consistently higher than those in cities across all age groups, with working-age adults (aged 35 to 64) most at risk, the new report revealed. \nMoreover, by 2015, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Native Americans and whites seemed especially vulnerable, the investigators found. \nFor the study, Asha Ivey-Stephenson and colleagues at the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control analyzed death-certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System. The researchers compared trends in suicide rates in rural counties to suicide rates in large and small metropolitan counties. \nOverall, rural counties saw 17 suicides per 100,000 people, compared to about 15 per 100,000 in medium/small metropolitan counties and just under 12 per 100,000 in large metropolitan counties. \nRace and gender also played a role, with males up to five times more likely to end their lives than women, regardless of where they lived, the findings showed. \nThe study also found that blacks in rural regions were less likely to die by suicide than blacks in urban areas. \nIn cities, suicide rates were highest among whites; in rural areas, suicide was most prevalent among American Indian/Alaska Natives. \nAll regions saw increases in suicide by firearms and hanging/suffocation, but rural residents were almost twice as likely to use guns as people in urban areas, according to the report. \nJames Mercy is director of CDC's Division of Violence Prevention. He said, \"The trends in suicide rates by sex, race, ethnicity, age, and mechanism that we see in the general population are magnified in rural areas.\" \nAccording to Mercy, \"This report underscores the need for suicide prevention strategies that are tailored specifically for these communities.\" \nOne such program, called Sources of Strength, was developed with rural and tribal communities in North Dakota. At its core is an attempt to understand socioeconomic factors affecting suicide rates, the CDC authors noted in their report. \nHelp with suicide prevention is available 24 hours a day by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). \nThe study findings were published in the Oct. 6 issue of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . \nSOURCES: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, news release, Oct. 5, 2017; Oct. 6, 2017, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

He is from the epidemiology and immunization services branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency. \nCases of the viral liver disease are also now being reported in Santa Cruz and Los Angeles counties, where 70 and 12 people have been diagnosed, respectively, the Los Angeles Times reported. \nThe first signs of the outbreak surfaced almost a year ago. \n\"From November 2016 to February 2017, between seven and nine cases would have been expected, yet 19 cases were reported,\" McDonald said during a media briefing Thursday. \nWhat triggered this outbreak remains unknown and will most likely never be identified, he added. \nSan Diego County is fighting the outbreak with an aggressive vaccination program, with some 54,000 at-risk residents vaccinated already, McDonald said. \nIn addition to vaccination, the health department is promoting a program that stresses hygiene and sanitation, including hand washing. \nSpeaking at the media briefing, Dr. Monique Foster, from the division of viral hepatitis at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that \"hepatitis A virus is a vaccine-preventable disease.\" \nIt's typically transmitted from person to person through a fecal/oral route, she said. \nCases of hepatitis A have been dropping since a vaccine was introduced in 1996, Foster noted. \nHowever, outbreaks can occur in high-risk populations, she said. These include people who travel to areas where hepatitis A is endemic, gay and bisexual men, and illicit drug users, Foster said. \nOutbreaks can last for up to two years, she added. \nNo treatment for the disease exists, and those who are older or have liver disease tend to have more serious infections, Foster said. \n\"It can lead to liver failure and death, of course,\" she noted. \nOne of the difficulties in identifying hepatitis A is that it can take nearly a month for symptoms to appear after someone had been infected, Foster explained. \n\"This makes investigating an outbreak difficult,\" she said. \nIn this outbreak, it is particularly difficult to trace the disease because so many of the patients are homeless and wary of the government, Foster said. \nSo far, 13 of the patients were illicit drug users and 10 of the 19 were homeless, McDonald said. \nThe number of cases continued to rise in April, May and June, but had since leveled off, at about 20 new cases a week, he said. \nMost of the patients are men [68 percent] and 32 percent are women, he said. Eight cases were among gay or bisexual men. \"It's unlikely that sexual transmission is contributing to the outbreak here,\" McDonald noted. \nThe average age of patients is 43, he said. \nThe makeup of patients, according to McDonald, was 33 percent homeless and drug users, 17 percent homeless only, 12 percent illicit drug users only, 26 percent neither homeless nor drug users, and for 12 percent these factors weren't known. \nAmong the 26 percent who weren't homeless and didn't use drugs, most had contact with someone who was, McDonald added. \nMany of the patients were also infected with other types of hepatitis or had other medical problems, he said. \nFor example, nearly 18 percent of the patients were also infected with hepatitis C, and nearly 6 percent with hepatitis B, McDonald said. \nAlthough most of the patients were at high risk for hepatitis A because they were drug users or had liver disease, none were vaccinated, he said, \"which was a major missed opportunity for prevention.\" \nMcDonald stressed that for people who are not in one of the risk groups, the risk for getting hepatitis A is extremely low. \nMost adults with hepatitis A have symptoms that can include fatigue, poor appetite, stomach pain, nausea and jaundice (yellowing of the skin), according to the CDC. \nThese symptoms usually last about two months. The best way to prevent hepatitis A infection is to get vaccinated, the CDC says. \nSOURCES: Oct 5, 2017, media briefing with: Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., epidemiology and immunization services branch, San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency; Monique Foster, M.D., M.P.H., division of viral hepatitis, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

She is a dietitian and clinical assistant professor of sports medicine at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. \n\"In addition to piling on the empty calories, sugar creates more metabolic work for the liver,\" she noted. \nIn the study, Griffin's team tracked the liver health of a group of middle-aged men with either high (11 men) or low (14 men) levels of fat in their liver. \nExcess fat accumulation in the liver is considered unhealthy, and the men with high fat levels already had a condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). According to the American Liver Foundation, NAFLD is tied to obesity and affects up to one-quarter of Americans. \nThe men were asked to follow one of two diets: a high-sugar diet, consuming 650 calories' worth of sugar each day for three months; or a low-sugar diet that contained no more than 140 calories of sugar per day. \nThe investigators found that the participants with NAFLD who followed the high-sugar diet developed changes in their fat metabolism -- the processes by which the body breaks down fats in the blood and uses them for energy. Those changes are well-known to be linked to a greater risk for heart disease, heart attacks and stroke, the research team said. \nBut similar changes were also noted in the livers of otherwise healthy men who had a low level of liver fat when the study began. \nIn this group, men developed higher levels of this fat in the liver after switching to the high-sugar diet. The researchers also found changes in their fat metabolism that were similar to the men who already had NAFLD. \n\"Our findings provide new evidence that consuming high amounts of sugar can alter your fat metabolism in ways that could increase your risk of cardiovascular disease,\" Griffin said in a university news release. \nThe study authors said their findings are particularly concerning since the prevalence of NAFLD is on the rise among children as well as adults. \n\"While most adults don't consume the high levels of sugar we used in this study, some children and teenagers may reach these levels of sugar intake by over-consuming fizzy drinks and sweets,\" Griffin said. \"This raises concern for the future health of the younger population, especially in view of the alarmingly high prevalence of NAFLD in children and teenagers, and exponential rise of fatal liver disease in adults.\" \nDr. Rachel Bond helps direct Women's Heart Health at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Reviewing the findings, she said that the study's \"conclusion that a sugar-laden diet may raise your risk of dying of heart disease is something we cannot ignore. In my practice, I emphasize that even a spoonful of sugar, albeit in excess, could potentially be putting one's heart at increased risk.\" \nBut White added that it's not always easy to track just how much sugar you might consume each day. \n\"It's really difficult for consumers to assess how much sugar they are consuming, since it's found in so many unexpected places,\" she explained. \n\"Sugar is not only found in candy, soda and cookies, it's in sauces and condiments, and lots of savory snacks are also packing sugar into the daily diet,\" White said, so \"checking ingredient lists to cut back on sugar intake is a must.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 5 in the journal Clinical Science . \nSOURCES: Dana Angelo White, MS RD, clinical assistant professor of athletic training and sports medicine, Quinnipiac University, Hamden, Conn.; Rachel Bond, M.D., associate director, Women's Heart Health, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York City; University of Surrey, news release, Oct. 4, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

And, that's particularly true if youngsters are otherwise healthy, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \nThe five tests include hormone tests, endocrine tests, vitamin D screening, thyroid or insulin tests for overweight children and thyroid ultrasounds for kids with an enlarged thyroid gland or autoimmune thyroid disease, the group noted. \nDoctors and their patients should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of these procedures, advised Dr. Paul Kaplowitz in an AAP news release. He's past chairperson of the AAP Section on Endocrinology. \n\"As a pediatric endocrinologist, I've counseled many parents who are worried about their children's growth,\" Kaplowitz said. \n\"There is a wide range of what is 'normal' for child growth and development. If a child is otherwise healthy and is following their own curve, what the parents often need is reassurance that their child is fine, and not a lot of testing,\" he said. \nThe AAP compiled a list of the five commonly used procedures, urging doctors to use evidence-based strategies when ordering these tests. \nHormone tests, for example, may be unnecessary for children with pubic hair or body odor but no other physical signs of puberty, such as a growth spurt or breast development. \nScreening tests for endocrine disorders are unlikely to benefit children with a normal growth rate, according to the AAP. \nEven when these tests are performed on children who are shorter than average, they only reveal an underlying health issue in 1 percent of cases. Screening tests may be indicated, however, for children who are significantly shorter than they should be based on their parents' height, the group added. \nMeanwhile, testing for vitamin D deficiency is only appropriate for patients with disorders associated with low bone mass, such as rickets. \nFor obese children, thyroid testing should only be considered if their growth rate is abnormally low or there is another sign of a thyroid issue. \nThyroid ultrasounds may cause unnecessary worry and expenses among children and their parents. This test should be limited to children with swelling on only one side of their neck, nodules that can be felt through the skin and those with very enlarged thyroid glands. \n\"This new Choosing Wisely list will enhance discussions physicians and families have about issues in growth and development that often come up, and help craft the best treatment plans,\" Kaplowitz said. \nSOURCE: American Academy of Pediatrics, news release, October 3, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

He's an economist and demographer at the University of Michigan. \nAmericans born in 1960 or later must wait until age 67 to collect their full Social Security benefit. People born before that were able to collect sooner. \nSchoeni and his colleagues analyzed data collected over decades by the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThey found that a higher percentage of Americans now in their 50s rated their own health as just fair or poor, compared with what older Americans said about their own health at a similar age. \nAlso, middle-aged Americans today say they suffer from a higher rate of memory and thinking problems, versus prior generations of 50-year-olds. \nMoreover, a higher proportion of the later-born groups was limited in the ability to perform a basic daily living task, such as shopping for groceries, taking medications or getting out of bed. \nHowever, physical function (the ability to climb stairs without resting, lifting 10 pounds, etc.) did not appear to differ significantly across generations. \nThe researchers said the findings may have implications if legislators consider whether or not to shift the official age of full Social Security retirement to a later starting point. \nThe report appears in the October issue of the journal Health Affairs . \nSOURCES: Health Affairs , news release, Oct. 2, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Researchers tested rVSV-ZEBOV, along with another experimental vaccine called ChAd3-EBO-Z. \nThey found that both vaccines elicited an immune system response against Ebola. \nAlmost 84 percent of people given the rVSV-ZEBOV and 71 percent of those given the ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine developed antibodies against the virus within a month. \nAnd most were still showing an immune response after one year. \nThat's the main new finding from the trial, said Thomas Geisbert, an Ebola researcher who was not involved in the study. \n\"This shows there's some durability of the immune response, which is important,\" said Geisbert, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \nHe added, though, that it's not clear how significant that lasting immune response might be. \nDr. Clifford Lane, the senior researcher on the new study, agreed. \n\"We don't know what level of antibody response is needed to prevent Ebola disease,\" explained Lane, of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). \nThe researchers were not able to study the vaccines' ability to prevent the disease because the Liberia epidemic ended before the trial got to that stage. \nStill, Geisbert said, coupled with the earlier trial, the findings \"solidify rVSV-ZEBOV as the leading Ebola vaccine candidate.\" \nHe said the findings also support the vaccine's safety. The most common side effects were temporary headache, muscle pain and fever. \nEbola has been recognized since 1976, and has become infamous for its gruesome lethality -- in some cases, causing patients to hemorrhage internally and externally. On average, the fatality rate is 50 percent, according to the World Health Organization. \nIn the trial reported last year, researchers found that the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was \"100 percent\" effective when given in a \"ring vaccination\" approach. \nIt works like this: Once an Ebola infection is confirmed, health workers try to contact the victim's friends, family and others who might have been exposed, so they can be vaccinated. \nIt's not entirely clear how an effective vaccine would be deployed, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. \nRing vaccination is one way, he said. Or if an outbreak were larger, he added, it might be best to vaccinate people in a given geographic area. \nPre-emptively vaccinating health care workers who will be exposed to Ebola patients is another strategy, said Goodman, who had no role in the current study. \nThe rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is made from an animal virus genetically engineered to carry an Ebola virus gene, according to NIAID. It was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. \nThe vaccine has not yet been approved by any regulatory agency. But Merck, its manufacturer, reached an agreement with the nonprofit Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to stockpile 300,000 doses in advance of another outbreak. \n\"Ideally,\" Goodman said, \"we'd like to have more than one effective vaccine.\" That's partly because the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine targets only one Ebola strain. \nAccording to Goodman, the vaccine trials show that it's possible to run rigorous studies during an outbreak. \nExperimental vaccines were in existence when the recent outbreak struck because scientists had been developing them as a bioterror defense. \nBut it took time to get the trials running. The current study launched in February 2015 -- which ended up being too late to get \"more definitive answers,\" Goodman pointed out. \nWith more advance planning, he said, future trials could get going sooner. \n\"We need to do even better next time,\" Goodman said. \nThe study appears in the Oct. 12 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine . \nSOURCES: H.

People who develop sepsis have an over 20 percent risk of death from the infection, the researchers noted. Each year, sepsis claims the lives of 6 million people worldwide. \nTo see what might boost the risk of this deadly infection, the investigators reviewed the records of nearly 2,000 Norwegian sepsis patients. \nThe findings showed that smoking combined with obesity and an inactive lifestyle was a major threat for blood poisoning. People with those three factors faced nearly a five times higher risk of sepsis than their non-smoking, normal-weight peers. \nThe body mass index (BMI) of people used in that calculation was 35. Body mass index is a rough estimate of body fat based on height and weight measurements. \nA BMI below 25 is considered normal weight, and anything over 30 is considered obese, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Someone with a BMI of 35 who is 5 feet, 9 inches tall weighs about 240 pounds. \nWhen looking at obesity alone, people with a BMI between 30 and 35 had a 30 percent increased risk of sepsis, according to the report. \n\"People with a BMI over 40 had three times as high a risk as those of normal weight,\" study co-author Julie Paulsen, a Ph.D. candidate at Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said in a school news release. \nSmoking alone appeared to boost risk by 50 percent when compared with people who never smoked, the research team also found. \nAnd being completely inactive was tied to a nearly doubled sepsis risk, when compared with those who exercised strenuously for at least an hour a week. \nObese people were also more likely to die from sepsis. People with a BMI of 40 or more had three times the risk of dying from the infection, the study showed. \nAlthough the researchers couldn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship, they pointed out that this study suggests that lifestyle-related measures can reduce the risk of serious infections. \nThe report was published recently in the International Journal of Epidemiology . \nSOURCE: Norwegian University of Science and Technology, news release, Oct. 3, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

He is a graduate student in public health at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \n\"We know from experience that the tobacco industry and their allies will not wait for all the facts to begin making health claims,\" he added. \n\"We need to first ensure, before heat-not-burn reaches the market, that consumers are aware we don't have all the facts on heat-not-burn products, and then we should begin filling in those knowledge gaps,\" Caputi said. \nHe said that \"considering the absolutely massive public health implications of tobacco products, generally -- that is, tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death -- picking up a heat-not-burn device before we have all the facts is not a decision consumers should take lightly.\" \nCaputi and his colleagues published their study online Oct. 11 in the journal PLOS One . \nTo get a handle on the potential popularity of heat-not-burn devices in the American marketplace, the researchers looked at Google search patterns in Japan to gauge shifting interest in the mechanism. \nThe team found that heat-not-burn Google searches in Japan spiked by more than 1400 percent in 2015, when the devices were first released in that country, and by nearly 3000 percent between 2015 and 2017. There are now as many as 7.5 million searches a month in Japan. \nThat trend reflects an even greater interest than that seen when e-cigarettes were first introduced in the Japanese market, the researchers said. \nStudy co-author John Ayers is a research professor at the San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health. He said, \"Unfortunately, we don't know what the health implications are for heat-not-burn tobacco. Our study simply shows these products are insanely popular in Japan, their only national test market. \n\"Even if interest in these products is just one-tenth as much in the U.S., it suggests many millions will seek out these products,\" Ayers added. \nAccording to Caputi, \"the available evidence does suggest that heat-not-burn tobacco products -- if they're approved by the FDA -- will be coming to a store near you.\" Because of that, \"we need to combat unfounded claims surrounding the health implications of heat-not-burn tobacco products,\" he said. \n\"For example, e-cigarettes are banned from being marketed as safe or even as cessation tools because there is insufficient data to back up those arguments, and yet we know those claims are routinely made and understood,\" Caputi said. \"Public health professionals need to form a strategy to ensure that same problem doesn't happen to heat-not-burn products.\" \nSOURCES: John W.

She's a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education. \n\"This shows that with effective tobacco control policies, even hardcore smokers will soften over time,\" Kulik said in a UCSF news release. \nFor the study, researchers analyzed health data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Almost 120,000 smokers were asked about their daily cigarette habit and any attempts to quit smoking for at least one day over the past 12 months. \nThe survey also included information collected on the participants' mental state. The researchers then divided the smokers into three groups based on their mental distress: no distress, moderate distress and serious psychological distress. \nFrom 1997 to 2015, smokers in all three groups smoked significantly fewer cigarettes. The number of cigarettes those in the \"no distress\" group smoked each day fell from 16 to 11. Daily cigarette consumption also dropped among the smokers in the \"high distress\" group, from 19.6 to 14.5. \nIn all three groups, the proportion of smokers trying to quit increased, but the increase was highest among the smokers with the most mental distress. \n\"The finding that there were more quit attempts among smokers with the highest levels of distress might reflect the fact that although these smokers are motivated and willing to quit, they may need more help quitting successfully,\" said senior study author Stanton Glantz, director of the tobacco control center at UCSF. \n\"This indicates that we should be encouraging our mental health providers to treat tobacco dependence along with other problems,\" he added. \n\"Contrary to popular belief, treating nicotine addiction does not complicate the treatment of other substance abuse or mental health issues, and in fact has been shown to improve outcomes among people in substance abuse treatment and recovery,\" Glantz said. \"Even smokers with the greatest psychological distress can be reached and helped to quit.\" \nThe researchers added that their findings show that tobacco control policies are influencing even hardcore smokers, challenging the tobacco industry's view that the only way to control tobacco use is to provide less harmful products, such as e-cigarettes. \nThe findings were published on Oct. 10 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine . \nSOURCE: University of California, San Francisco, news release, Oct. 10, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

She is an assistant professor of medicine at the Warren Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University. \n\"Tai chi exercise can reach low-to-moderate intensity levels,\" she explained in a news release from the American Heart Association. \"The emphasis on breathing and relaxation can also help with stress reduction and psychological distress.\" \nParticipants in the study included 29 people, age 68 on average, who'd had a heart attack or a procedure to open a blocked artery. All were sedentary, and most had risk factors for heart problems, such as being overweight, smoking or having diabetes or high cholesterol. All of them also had rejected participation in cardiac rehabilitation. \nFor the study, they took part in either a short program (24 classes over 12 weeks) or a longer one (52 classes over 24 weeks). All were given a DVD so they could practice tai chi at home. \nTai chi was found to be safe for the participants with heart disease, with minor muscle pain at the very start the only negative effect. Tai chi also was well-liked by the participants, who all reported they would recommend it to a friend. The researchers said the participants attended 66 percent of classes, suggesting it's a manageable routine. \nTai chi didn't boost the participants' aerobic fitness levels after three months. But those who completed the longer program did get more moderate to vigorous physical activity on a weekly basis, the study reported. \nThe findings were published Oct. 11 in the Journal of the American Heart Association . \n\"On its own, tai chi wouldn't obviously replace other components of traditional cardiac rehabilitation, such as education on risk factors, diet and adherence to needed medications,\" Salmoirago-Blotcher said. \n\"If proven effective in larger studies,\" she said, \"it might be possible to offer it as an exercise option within a rehab center as a bridge to more strenuous exercise, or in a community setting with the educational components of rehab delivered outside of a medical setting.\" \nSOURCE: American Heart Association, news release, Oct. 11, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Each year, prevalence of high blood pressure went up by 1 percent, diabetes rose by 2 percent, high cholesterol went up by 7 percent, smoking increased by 5 percent, and drug abuse jumped 7 percent, the researchers found. \n\"The risk of dying from a stroke has declined significantly, while at the same time the risk factors are increasing,\" said researcher Dr. Ralph Sacco. He's a professor of neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. \n\"We are not exactly sure why these increases are occurring,\" Sacco said. \nIt's possible that doctors are getting better at diagnosing risk factors. Or certain lifestyle factors may play a role, Sacco suggested. These include obesity, lack of exercise, poor diet and smoking. \nThe increase of drug abuse among younger patients is especially concerning, he added. \nAlthough the increases in risk factors were seen in all racial and ethnic groups, increases in high blood pressure among blacks and diabetes among Hispanics stood out, Sacco noted. \nHe stressed that patients need to know their blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. \"There are great medications that can be used to treat those conditions,\" Sacco said. \n\"We need to go further in controlling risk factors, like diet and exercise,\" he advised. \nAccording to Dr. Salman Azhar, director of stroke at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, \"The challenge now is to prevent strokes, and if they have had a stroke, trying to prevent a second stroke. This is where the importance of these risk factors comes in.\" \nThe responsibility to reduce risk factors lies with patients, but also with the community, he continued. \n\"It's up to communities to provide access to better food and places to exercise. We have a responsibility as a community and a health system,\" Azhar said. \nThe 922,000 people included in the study had been hospitalized for an ischemic stroke, which is caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain. These are the most common types of stroke. \nThe number of stroke patients who had one or more risk factors increased from 88 percent in 2004 to 95 percent in 2014, the findings showed. \nFor hospitalized stroke patients during the 10-year study period, high cholesterol rates more than doubled, from 29 percent to 59 percent, and the rate of diabetes went from 31 percent to 38 percent. \nIn addition, high blood pressure rates increased from 73 percent to 84 percent, and the prevalence of drug abuse doubled from 1.4 percent to 2.8 percent. Also, kidney failure increased each year by 13 percent, and plaque buildup in the carotid (neck) arteries rose by 6 percent each year, the investigators found. \nDr. David Katz is director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center in Derby, Conn. He said the improvement in stroke survival \"suggests we are relying on advances in treatment while neglecting prevention.\" \nKatz, who is also president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, said, \"Treating disease is never as good as preserving health and vitality.

Most women are diagnosed after the age of 50. Having certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes also predispose women to the disease. And there are some lifestyle-related risk factors that can be controlled, such as hormone therapy after menopause, obesity, alcohol intake and physical inactivity, Evers said. \n\"Having one risk factor or even several doesn't mean a woman will definitely develop breast cancer,\" she said in a Fox Chase news release. \"Women need to become educated about the risk factors, especially those they can control, and then adjust their lifestyle accordingly.\" \nNot all women with breast cancer experience the same warning signs of the disease. Symptoms of breast cancer may include: A lump in the breast or armpit. Swelling or thickening in part of the breast. Dimpling or irritation of the skin on the breast. Pain in the breast that doesn't go away. Redness or flaky skin on the breast or nipple. Unusual nipple discharge. A change in the size or shape of the breast. \nIn some cases, women never develop any of these symptoms, Evers noted. \n\"All women should know how their breasts look and feel so they can recognize any changes in them. This is an important part of breast health,\" she said. \"But just being familiar with your breasts should never take the place of regular screenings and mammograms. These tests can help find breast cancer in its early stages, even before symptoms appear.\" \nThere are three tests often used to look for breast cancer, Evers said. Mammogram: An X-ray of the breast used to examine breast changes. Its effectiveness depends on the size of a breast tumor and the density of breast tissue. Three-dimensional (3D) mammography involves X-ray machines that take pictures of thin slices of the breast from different angles, to build a 3D image. Breast ultrasound: This test is often used along with mammography to screen high-risk women and those with dense breast tissue. Breast MRI: This test may be used to screen high-risk women and more closely examine a suspicious area detected during a mammogram or an ultrasound. \n\"I advise women to speak with their physician to determine what is right for them,\" Evers said. \nSOURCE: Fox Chase Cancer Center, news release, October 2017 HealthDay Copyright   More Health News on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "healthday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary elizabeth dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathryn evers", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national library of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox chase cancer center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T21:39:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8c1e0b657d3a22d8bc03e6878e1c0cf06089c06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0VRcxQgVfzpi0vt2XfzCNYk-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to Talk to Someone With Cancer: MedlinePlus Health News", "title_full": "How to Talk to Someone With Cancer: MedlinePlus Health News", "published": "2017-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.149, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8c1e0b657d3a22d8bc03e6878e1c0cf06089c06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0VRcxQgVfzpi0vt2XfzCNYk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Dallas", "published": "2017-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Talk to Someone With Cancer: MedlinePlus Health News", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169048.html How to Talk to Someone With Cancer To foster healing, keep communication open, constant and positive, expert suggests   By Mary Elizabeth Dallas   For people diagnosed with cancer, communication with family members plays a vital role in their health and well-being, according to an expert from San Diego State University. \nAfter studying this issue for a decade, communications professor Wayne Beach concluded that cancer patients benefit from continuous positive dialogue. \n\"Cancer patients do cope and heal better depending on their communication within their families,\" Beach said in a university news release. \"Without this proper communication, these patients don't heal as well or as long. Having a dysfunctional environment around you is not good -- it's stressful.\" \nPatients and their loved ones cope better, he found, when they share stories, reminisce and talk about their hopes as well as their concerns. \n\"How family members communicate when coping [with a diagnosis] is important,\" Beach said. \"Patients have reported feeling empowered when communication is comprehensive and constant in their home and medical surroundings.\" \nFor the past 10 years, Beach and a team of researchers analyzed phone and face-to-face interactions between cancer patients and their families, as well as interactions between patients and health care professionals. \nThough cancer is often viewed as a grim diagnosis, the researchers found that the conversations between patients and their loved ones focused on life, not death. \n\"If you hear someone has been diagnosed with cancer, our natural inclination tends to be to think of it as a death sentence,\" Beach said. \"It is so much more about hope than despair. I really didn't expect that going in.\" \nBeach provided several do's and don'ts for people with loved ones who've been diagnosed with cancer. \nDo: Offer encouragement and stay positive. Talk frequently. Be open about how you're feeling. Actively listen to what the patient is saying. Allow the patient to vent and share their fears. \nDon't: Avoid talking about cancer or anything related to the diagnosis. Dwell or focus on negatives. \nSOURCE: California State University, news release, Oct. 6, 2017 HealthDay Copyright   More Health News on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "healthday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary elizabeth dallas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "california state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national library of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-14T00:27:40.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20347dcb492ab31f0942f8941fb1ba11fab3f857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0bSInc8v.ttSohy8PPwmihI-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "", "title": "Happier Mealtimes, Healthier Eating for Kids: MedlinePlus Health News", "title_full": "Happier Mealtimes, Healthier Eating for Kids: MedlinePlus Health News", "published": "2017-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.62, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20347dcb492ab31f0942f8941fb1ba11fab3f857", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0bSInc8v.ttSohy8PPwmihI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Dallas", "published": "2017-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Happier Mealtimes, Healthier Eating for Kids: MedlinePlus Health News", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169046.html Happier Mealtimes, Healthier Eating for Kids A positive atmosphere prompts preschoolers to eat more fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods (*this news item will not be available after 01/10/2018) By Mary Elizabeth Dallas Thursday, October 12, 2017 \nTHURSDAY, Oct. 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Parents who struggle to get their children to follow a healthy diet may want to make dinnertime a pleasant experience, new research suggests. \nThe study found a happier emotional atmosphere during meals allows preschoolers to make healthier food choices. \n\"Having more positive mealtimes, where people are enjoying themselves, where there's mutual warmth and engagement, makes it a little bit easier for children to approach healthy foods,\" said lead author Jaclyn Saltzman, a doctoral candidate in the department of human development and family studies at the University of Illinois. \nAnd that's especially important in young kids, she noted. \n\"The eating behaviors you have early in childhood can track later on,\" Saltzman said in a university news release. \n\"Preschoolers are unique because they are on solid foods with a diet similar to adults, but their food choices are still mostly under the control of their parents. We really want to see what effect parents are having, and this gives us that window of opportunity to see that,\" she added. \nFor the study, 74 parents of preschoolers between 3 and 5 years old answered two questionnaires about mealtimes over the course of about two years. \nDuring this time, researchers conducted a home visit to observe the family during mealtime. They tracked the positive and negative emotions expressed by both the mothers and their children. \nAfter watching how mothers and their kids interacted, the researchers found that a more pleasant or happy meal had a positive effect on what the children consumed. \nOverall, children ate, on average, about one serving more of fruit, vegetables or a soy-protein product during more positive mealtimes, the study revealed. \n\"When you have a negative family mealtime, you don't want to sit there and try a new thing, enjoy a new texture, or cajole your child into trying something new. You just want to get through it,\" Saltzman explained. \n\"We were happy to see that families who are more positive at their mealtimes have kids who seem to be eating a little more healthy food,\" she said. \nThe researchers also considered how to help parents, who may not always be feeling very happy, create a more positive mood during mealtimes. \nThey found that including children in grocery shopping as well as meal planning and preparation help generate more positive emotions during meals. \n\"First of all, I wouldn't tell parents to just be more positive, to just slap a smile on your face, because in the face of a picky-eating preschooler or any other mealtime challenge, that's just not going to work,\" Saltzman said. \"But there are several things parents can do.\" \nHere are her suggestions: Be clear about what is expected during meals. Establish a routine, eating at about the same time and in the same room or setting each day. Give kids jobs. Assign individual tasks, such as setting the table. Remind kids to express themselves with words and not scream when they are upset. Don't force it. Parents should encourage their children to try new foods, but after several tries it may be time to move on. Kids don't have to like everything. Stay calm. Parents should try techniques such as breathing exercises to help them keep their emotions in check. \nThe study was published in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology . \nSOURCE: University of Illinois, news release, Oct. 4, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

There were no such improvements in the traditional exercise group. \nResearchers also found hints that all those mambos and cha-chas had extra brain benefits. \nSeniors in both groups showed growth in the hippocampus -- a brain structure that's involved in memory and learning. But the dancers showed changes in more areas of the hippocampus. \nPatrick Muller, one of the researchers on the study, suggested an explanation: The \"multimodal\" nature of dance -- its physical and mental components -- might be behind the extra brain boost. \nSeniors in the dance group had to continually learn and \"imprint\" new steps, explained Muller, a Ph.D. candidate at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Magdeburg, Germany. \nAlong with that mental challenge, he said, dance also involves coordinating movement with music -- which itself affects the brain. Plus, there's the fun, Muller noted. \nDavid Marquez is an associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He said it's hard to know what to make of the brain findings, since the study group was so small. \nMarquez, who was not involved in the research, is studying the effects of Latin dance classes on older Hispanic adults' well-being. \nHe agreed that dance can offer things that simpler repetitive activity may not. \n\"With dance, you're having to think about each step,\" Marquez said. \"There are motor, cognitive and social components. And there's the music.\" \nBut, he added, both exercise groups in this study showed changes in the hippocampus, on average. And that's in line with past research, Marquez noted: Studies have found that regular aerobic exercise, like walking, may boost the volume of brain areas involved in memory, planning and other vital functions. \n\"So the message is, get moving,\" Marquez said. \nUltimately, he added, the \"best\" form of exercise for any one person is the one that can be maintained. \n\"If you don't enjoy the activity, you won't do it,\" Marquez said. \"So find something you enjoy and do it regularly.\" \nThe study, published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience , included healthy volunteers who were typically in their late 60s. \nHalf were randomly assigned to take dance classes over 18 months. The rest attended a traditional exercise program that included walking, stationary bikes, strength-training and stretching. \nThe dance group met twice a week for the first six months, then weekly. To keep participants on their toes, the dance styles changed every couple of weeks and ranged from Latin to line dancing to jazz. \nJust 14 seniors from the dance group and 12 from the traditional fitness group stayed with the program for the full 18 months. \nIn the end, the study found, only the dancers showed clear improvements on balance tests. And while both groups had increases in their hippocampal volume, the dance group tended to show changes in more subregions of the hippocampus. \nThe hippocampus is critical, according to Muller, because it is affected in dementia -- including Alzheimer's disease -- and it can also shrink with age. \nThe big question, though, is whether dance can make any difference in the odds of seniors' mental decline. \n\"Further research is needed to clarify whether this intervention truly has the potential to reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's,\" Muller said. \nAccording to Marquez, it would be interesting to do the same study with older adults who already have some cognitive impairment, and see if there are similar brain changes. \nFor now, Muller said, the findings suggest dance might have some advantages over simpler repetitive physical activity. \nBut he agreed that exercise in general -- plus a healthy lifestyle overall -- \"can help the brain stay young.\" \nSOURCES: Patrick Muller, Ph.D. candidate, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Magdeburg, Germany; David Marquez, Ph.D., associate professor, kinesiology and nutrition, University of Illinois at Chicago; June 2017, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience HealthDay Copyright   More Health News on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david marquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick muller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of illinois", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magdeburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-15T00:52:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "128d4334e75eb1894dbd84b35cf83ef58e9b2333", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0XrtSHO1IM8LyavhP5P4MnY-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Scientists Spot Genes Behind Skin Color", "title_full": "Scientists Spot Genes Behind Skin Color", "published": "2017-10-12T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "128d4334e75eb1894dbd84b35cf83ef58e9b2333", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0XrtSHO1IM8LyavhP5P4MnY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scientists Spot Genes Behind Skin Color", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169047.html Scientists Spot Genes Behind Skin Color Study looked at varying populations across Africa   By Robert Preidt   Humans come in a range of colors, and new research is getting a step closer to how that happens. \nNewly identified gene variants tied to skin colors among Africans could offer insights into human evolution. The findings could also boost scientists' understanding of skin cancer and other conditions, researchers say. \n\"We have identified new genetic variants that contribute to the genetic basis of one of the most strikingly variable traits in modern humans,\" said study senior author Sarah Tishkoff. She's professor of genetics and biology at the University of Pennsylvania. \nUntil now, only a few genes linked with normal variation in skin color have been pinpointed. Most of them have been found in studies of Europeans. \nIn this study, researchers assessed skin pigmentation and genetic data from nearly 1,600 ethnically and genetically diverse people in Africa. \n\"When people think of skin color in Africa, most would think of darker skin, but we show that within Africa there is a huge amount of variation, ranging from skin as light as some Asians to the darkest skin on a global level and everything in between,\" Tishkoff said in a university news release. \n\"We identify genetic variants affecting these traits and show that mutations influencing light and dark skin have been around for a long time, since before the origin of modern humans,\" she noted. \n\"Skin color is a classic variable trait in humans, and it's thought to be adaptive,\" Tishkoff said. \"Analysis of the genetic basis of variation in skin color sheds light on how adaptive traits evolve, including those that play a role in disease risk.\" \nThere are benefits to both light and dark skin. For example, darker skin is believed to help provide some protection against the sun's ultraviolet rays. Africans don't often develop the deadliest skin cancer, melanoma, the researchers said. \nOn the other hand, lighter skin improves sunlight-triggered vitamin D in regions with lower amounts of sunlight, the study authors added. \nMost of the skin color-linked genetic variants identified in the study appear to have originated more than 300,000 years ago. Some emerged roughly 1 million years ago, well before the advent of modern humans, according to the report. \nIn many cases, older versions of these variants were associated with moderately pigmented skin, which suggests that our ancient ancestors had lighter rather than darker skin. \n\"If you were to shave a chimp, it has light pigmentation, so it makes sense that skin color in the ancestors of modern humans could have been relatively light. It is likely that when we lost the hair covering our bodies and moved from forests to the open savannah, we needed darker skin. Mutations influencing both light and dark skin have continued to evolve in humans, even within the past few thousand years,\" Tishkoff explained. \nShe also said the study highlights the diversity of Africans and challenges biological notions of race. \n\"Many of the genes and new genetic variants we identified to be associated with skin color may never have been found outside of Africa, because they are not as highly variable,\" she said. \n\"There is so much diversity in Africa that's not often appreciated. There's no such thing as an African race. We show that skin color is extremely variable on the African continent and that it is still evolving. Further, in most cases the genetic variants associated with light skin arose in Africa,\" Tishkoff concluded. \nThe study was published Oct. 12 in the journal Science . \nSOURCE: University of Pennsylvania, news release, Oct. 12, 2017 HealthDay Copyright   More Health News on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tishkoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah tishkoff", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-15T00:53:09.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e25c7ce715d3ef139df99f49ae5f41fcd7cd0a16", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0a58aL2Cgj5RY1Gc7Dv_cvM-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Daily 'Light Therapy' May Help Some with Bipolar Disorder", "title_full": "Daily 'Light Therapy' May Help Some with Bipolar Disorder", "published": "2017-10-12T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e25c7ce715d3ef139df99f49ae5f41fcd7cd0a16", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0a58aL2Cgj5RY1Gc7Dv_cvM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Daily 'Light Therapy' May Help Some with Bipolar Disorder", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169050.html Daily 'Light Therapy' May Help Some With Bipolar Disorder Study found an hour in front of a light box helped ease depressive symptoms   By Robert Preidt   People afflicted with bipolar disorder may find some relief from depression with daily doses of light therapy, new research suggests. \nWith light therapy, people spend time sitting in close proximity to a light-emitting box -- in this case, bright white light -- with exposures increasing from 15 minutes per day to a full hour over a period of weeks. \nThe study found that within a month the therapy helped treat depression in people with bipolar disorder. \n\"Effective treatments for bipolar depression are very limited,\" noted lead researcher Dr. Dorothy Sit. \n\"This gives us a new treatment option for bipolar patients that we know gets us a robust response within four to six weeks,\" said Sit, who is associate professor of psychiatry at Northwestern University in Chicago. \nAccording to the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, bipolar disorder \"is a brain and behavior disorder characterized by severe shifts in a person's mood and energy, making it difficult for the person to function.\" Over 5.7 million Americans are thought to have the disorder, which often involves depressive episodes. \nAs Sit's team noted, prior research had shown that morning light therapy reduces symptoms of depression in people with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a condition where winter's reduced light spurs depression. \nHowever, it's also been noted that light therapy can sometimes cause side effects, such as mania, in people with bipolar disorder. \nStill, the Northwestern team wondered if the treatment might not have a role for bipolar patients with at least moderate depression who were also taking a mood stabilizer drug. \nIn the study, 46 patients received either a 7,000 lux bright white light or a 50 lux light (acting as the \"placebo arm\" of the trial). \nThe study participants were told to place the light box about one foot from their face for 15 minutes between noon and 2:30 p.m. each day at the start of the study. \nOver six weeks, the patients increased their light therapy \"doses\" in 15-minute increments until they reached a dose of 60 minutes per day -- or had a significant change in their mood. \nCompared with people in the placebo group, those in the treatment group were more likely to have significant improvements, Sit's team said. \nMore than 68 percent of patients in the treatment group achieved a normal mood versus 22 percent of those in the placebo group, the findings showed. Patients in the treatment group also had a much lower average depression score than those in the placebo group, and significantly higher functioning, meaning they could return to work or complete household tasks they hadn't been able to finish before treatment. \nSignificantly, none of the patients experienced mania or hypomania, a condition that includes a period of elation, euphoria, irritability, agitation, rapid speech, racing thoughts, a lack of focus and risk-taking behaviors. \n\"As clinicians, we need to find treatments that avoid these side effects and allow for a nice, stable response. Treatment with bright light at midday can provide this,\" Sit said in a university news release. \nTwo psychiatrists agreed that the therapy may have merit for patients, who often have few options. \n\"No standard antidepressants are approved for treatment of bipolar depression,\" said Dr. Seth Mandel, who directs psychiatry at Northwell Health's Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. He added that antipsychotics that are approved for bipolar disorder often come with side effects that cause many patients to stop using them. \nLight therapy \"offers us another option, one that certainly appears to do no harm,\" Mandel said. \nStill, he noted that patients with more severe symptoms weren't included in the Chicago study, and he also believes many people won't be able to adhere to the hour-long, daily dosage required. \nDr. Ami Baxi is a psychiatrist who directs adult inpatient services at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She agreed that light therapy may be \"a welcome addition to our limited treatment options for bipolar depression.\" \nThe study was funded by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health and published Oct. 3 in the American Journal of Psychiatry . \nSOURCES: Seth Mandel, M.D., chairman of psychiatry, Northwell Health's Huntington Hospital, Huntington, N.Y.; Ami Baxi, M.D., director of adult inpatient services, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York City; Northwestern University, news release, Oct. 10, 2017 HealthDay Copyright  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ami baxi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seth mandel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorothy sit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brain & behavior research foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntington hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwell health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwestern university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenox hill hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. national institute of mental health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american journal of psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenox hill hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-15T00:53:17.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f2604eff5100dcd660ce074f0bb6ddf6bf54179", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0euvnwYBKI7sHCB92mM51Cw-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Hearing Loss Can Challenge Relationships", "title_full": "Hearing Loss Can Challenge Relationships", "published": "2017-10-12T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f2604eff5100dcd660ce074f0bb6ddf6bf54179", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0euvnwYBKI7sHCB92mM51Cw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hearing Loss Can Challenge Relationships", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169053.html Hearing Loss Can Challenge Relationships It can trigger feelings of frustration, guilt and isolation -- for patients and those who love them (*this news item will not be available after 01/10/2018) By Mary Elizabeth Dallas Thursday, October 12, 2017 \nTHURSDAY, Oct. 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- People with hearing loss face daunting challenges, but so do those who love them, researchers report. \nProblems with hearing can be socially isolating for everyone involved, the British researchers explained. \n\"This is research which reviews the existing evidence we have on the impact of hearing loss on those diagnosed with the condition, as well as those around them,\" said study leader Venessa Vas, who's with the National Institute of Health Research Nottingham Biomedical Research Center. \nVas and her colleagues analyzed more than 70 existing studies investigating the problems faced by people with hearing loss. The studies also examined the issues faced by people who are close to someone with hearing impairments. \n\"Hearing loss is a chronic condition that affects the whole family,\" Vas said in a University of Nottingham news release. \"Yet, to our knowledge, our work represents the first attempt to piece together a picture of the effect of hearing loss from the perspectives of people with hearing loss and their partners.\" \nSome of the most common issues faced by people with hearing loss, as well as those closest to them, include: Phone calls. People with trouble hearing often can't hear the phone ring or hear a person talking on the other end. On the flip side, those around them report feeling frustrated by having to constantly answer the phone or alert someone when it's ringing. Volume control. People with hearing loss often raise the volume on the radio and TV, which may be problematic for those nearby. Social isolation. People with hearing loss often have trouble talking in crowds or noisy environments, which leaves them feeling left out or isolated from others. Meanwhile, their friends and loved ones may enjoy socializing, but be forced to attend events alone. Guilt and frustration. Hearing loss can make communication much more difficult and draining. This can put added strain on relationships, particularly when a partner feels guilty about not understanding the problems people with hearing loss face. \n\"Evidence from video-recorded audiology appointments shows that family members have a strong interest in being involved and sharing their experiences of the patient's hearing loss,\" Vas said. \"However, they are typically discounted by the audiologist.\" \nThe researchers concluded that by listening to patients' loved ones and friends during office visits, doctors can get a more accurate picture of the hearing loss challenges they face and develop better treatment plans to help them manage these difficulties. \nThe findings were published recently in the journal Trends in Hearing . \nSOURCE: University of Nottingham, news release, Oct. 5, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

That's according to lead researcher Claire Kamp Dush, associate professor of human development and family science at Ohio State University. \nIn the study of 52 working couples, men spent about 101 minutes kicking back while their wives took on household responsibilities during days both had off. \nBy comparison, women only had about 49 minutes of relaxation while their husbands performed chores. \n\"There was time where both of them were doing child care and housework at the same time, but there was also a lot of time where she was doing some kind of work and he was doing leisure,\" Kamp Dush said. \"Men were much more likely to have time like that than women.\" \nThe results show that household responsibilities still are being broken down along lines that leave women shouldering much more of the family burden, said Curtis Reisinger, a psychologist with Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, N.Y. \n\"Both males and females are continuing in their 'specialized' behaviors in their non-workdays,\" said Reisinger, who wasn't part of the study. \"Males continue their 'boys will be boys' leisure behaviors on weekends as they traditionally have. Women continue their traditional 'homemaker' role during their discretionary time.\" \nFor the study, researchers asked dual-earner couples in central Ohio who were expecting their first child to fill out a minute-by-minute time diary detailing how they spent their day. \nThe men and women both filled out a diary twice, once on a workday and again on a day off, during the third trimester of pregnancy. \nThe couples then repeated the process about three months after the baby's birth, to see if having an infant caused any shifts in behavior. \nThe amount of time men and women spent on housework and child care was more equal on workdays after the baby's birth, although women still did slightly more work, the researchers found. \n\"They're doing some things right, because at least on the days that they're working there's a pretty even split. They're usually sharing tasks,\" said Natasha Quadlin, an assistant professor of sociology at Ohio State University. She was not part of the research team. \nBut on days off, a huge gap appeared between husbands and wives: Men put their feet up 46 percent of the time as their partners performed child care; women rested only 16 percent of the time while husbands took care of the kid. The same went for housework. Fathers relaxed 35 percent of the time while their wives cleaned, cooked and ran errands, while women took it easy only 19 percent of the time while their men performed similar chores. Women had about the same amount of weekend leisure time before and after childbirth, 46 to 49 minutes, researchers found. But men's weekend leisure time more than doubled after childbirth, leaping from 47 minutes during pregnancy to 101 minutes, the results showed. \nIt's likely men are more protective of their time off thanks to the expectations under which they were raised, Reisinger said. \n\"In our society, men grew up with an entitlement that they get to play on the weekends. This is not a norm for females,\" Reisinger said. \"Consequently, men may resist the loss of leisure time more vehemently than women. Women do not have to give up such leisure time since they never had it to begin with.\" \nWomen also are under more societal pressure live up to homemaking ideals, Kamp Dush said. \n\"If your mother-in-law comes over to your house and it's messy, the mom is going to get blamed, not the dad,\" Kamp Dush said. \"Women have the sense of feeling more responsible for these things. That's translating into them doing more housework and more child care, even when they're working outside the home just as much as their partner.\" \nThis pressure is so great that women often intervene when husbands aren't performing chores to her standards, further undermining her own leisure time, Kamp Dush said. \nStudy results showed when men are doing child care or housework, about 40 percent of the time his wife is working alongside him, Kamp Dush noted. \nBut when women are engaged in these chores, men are helping out only 14 percent to 20 percent of the time. \n\"She's helping him with the task or watching him do the task or is there involved as well,\" Kamp Dush said. \"Women probably just need to just let men do those tasks, even if it's not the way they would personally do it. That would get them some more free time.\" \nMen can turn this trend around by taking on more of the shared responsibility during days off, Kamp Dush said. \n\"Tell your wife, you go have an afternoon, I got this,\" Kamp Dush said. \"Men need to realize they are responsible for this family and child and house, and they need to get in there and do it as well.\" \nThese inequalities could be addressed by allowing new moms and dads to swap responsibilities during the first months of parenthood, Kamp Dush said.

Denying this intervention is a moral failing, especially for children and patients at the end of life. \n\"If low- and middle-income countries could obtain morphine at the same price as rich countries, the annual global price tag for closing the gap in access to oral morphine would be $145 million, a fraction of the cost of running a medium-sized U.S. hospital,\" Knaul said. \n\"This is a pittance compared to $100 billion a year that the world's governments spend on enforcing global prohibition of drug use,\" she added. \n\"The biggest shame is children in low-income countries dying in pain, which could be eliminated for $1 million a year,\" Knaul said. \nThe problem is greatest in eight countries with the highest populations: China, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia and Mexico, the report said. \n\"We can ensure that the 61 million people a year who need it get palliative care,\" Knaul said. \"The alternative is unacceptable and unthinkable.\" \nSOURCE: The Lancet , news release, Oct. 12, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "healthday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knaul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felicia knaul", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national library of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lancet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of miami miller school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the lancet commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T16:32:48.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d330dbaa68c9b10bbf202abebc145a3956f6cb5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0WQ5JocFkHFlxsp6SBK_iXQ-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "", "title": "Plan an Allergy-Safe Halloween for Your Child: MedlinePlus Health News", "title_full": "Plan an Allergy-Safe Halloween for Your Child: MedlinePlus Health News", "published": "2017-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.281, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d330dbaa68c9b10bbf202abebc145a3956f6cb5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0WQ5JocFkHFlxsp6SBK_iXQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alan Mozes", "published": "2017-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Plan an Allergy-Safe Halloween for Your Child: MedlinePlus Health News", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169105.html Plan an Allergy-Safe Halloween for Your Child Common-sense rules will make Fright Night less scary (*this news item will not be available after 01/12/2018) By Alan Mozes Saturday, October 14, 2017 \nSATURDAY, Oct. 14, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Halloween's frights extend beyond goblins and ghouls if you're a child with food allergies or asthma. \n\"You want Halloween to be scary for the right reasons -- ghosts, goblins and witches -- not allergies and asthma,\" said allergist Dr. Stephen Tilles, president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. \n\"If you follow a few common-sense rules, you should be able to keep your kids safe and the party going without allergy and asthma symptoms,\" he said in an association news release. \nHere, Tilles offers parents tips on how to limit the risk of allergic reactions: \nDon't let children consume any candy that isn't clearly labeled for indications of potential allergens. Have them bring all goodies home for you to inspect, or drop off safe treats for your child with friends and at school. \nDoes your child have asthma? Keep an inhaler on hand while trick-or-treating, in case of exposure to smoke machines or mold while running door to door. A child who wheezes might also do better with a hat than a mask. \nPay attention to costuming. For example, children who struggle with a metal allergy might do well to wear gloves. And for those at risk for eczema, use only hypoallergenic makeup, or avoid makeup altogether. Also, read garment labels to avoid materials such as latex that could pose a problem. \nA teal-colored pumpkin on the doorstep is considered an indicator of food allergy awareness. This lets others know that that particular household will provide a nonfood trick-or-treat alternative. \nSOURCE: American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, news release HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Roughly 11 percent of children in the United States are affected by the condition, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n\"Previous studies have demonstrated disparities in overall health care utilization among racial and ethnic minorities, but few studies have examined this question specifically for eczema,\" said senior study author Dr. Junko Takeshita. She is an assistant professor of dermatology and epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine. \n\"This is the first study to look at racial and ethnic differences in health care utilization for eczema on an individual level rather than relying on a sample of outpatient visits, making this a unique evaluation of eczema that includes those not accessing care for their disease,\" she said in a Penn news release. \nThe study included health care data on a group of more than 2,000 children and teens under 18 with eczema. The data was collected from 2001 and 2013. \nBased on their analysis, the researchers estimated that 66 percent of the nearly 3 million children with eczema are white, 18 percent are black and 16 percent are Hispanic. Overall, about 60 percent of these children have been treated for their condition but the odds of being treated by a doctor also varies by race, the researchers found. \nAmong the white children with eczema, about 62 percent visited a doctor for the condition. Roughly 58 percent of Hispanic kids with the condition were also treated, compared to just 52 percent of black children. \nOverall, black children and teens with eczema are 30 percent less likely to see a doctor than white kids, the researchers calculated. \nThose who do see a doctor for eczema however tend to have more office visits and receive more prescriptions than white children, suggesting they have more severe cases of the condition, the researchers said. \n\"The data show that race alone can be a predictor of whether or not a child with eczema will see a doctor, independent of other social or demographic factors or insurance status,\" Takeshita said. \nMinority children with eczema also tended to be younger. They were more likely to also have asthma than the white children with the condition. The minority children were also less likely to have private insurance and more likely to come from low-income homes. \n\"While the study is not without its limitations, our findings suggest there are barriers to health care for eczema among black children, irrespective of income and insurance status, despite likely having more severe skin disease,\" Takeshita said. \n\"Further research is needed to understand what these barriers are and why they exist so that we can ultimately make efforts to eliminate this disparity,\" she added. \nThe study was published recently in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology . \nSOURCE: University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, news release, September 29, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "takeshita", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary elizabeth dallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "junko takeshita", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perelman school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania perelman school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "penn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T20:35:38.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1432a293ad67945448d04036fe3e2a3ccfa2851", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0aXoGN0bcCvY5cS4kNf39eA-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Good Lifestyle Choices Add Years to Your Life", "title_full": "Good Lifestyle Choices Add Years to Your Life", "published": "2017-10-13T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1432a293ad67945448d04036fe3e2a3ccfa2851", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0aXoGN0bcCvY5cS4kNf39eA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Good Lifestyle Choices Add Years to Your Life", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169087.html Good Lifestyle Choices Add Years to Your Life Certain behaviors, many associated with various genes, were linked to longevity in large study   01/11/2018) By Robert Preidt Friday, October 13, 2017 \nFRIDAY, Oct. 13,   Change your lifestyle, change your life span. \nThat's the claim of a new study that found not smoking, watching your weight and continuing to learn new things could help you live longer. \nAnd genes play a part in the lifestyle choices people make, according to researchers at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. \n\"The power of big data and genetics allow us to compare the effect of different behaviors and diseases in terms of months and years of life lost or gained, and to distinguish between mere association and causal effect,\" researcher Jim Wilson said in a university news release. But this study didn't prove that lifestyle choices cause life span to shorten or lengthen. \nFor the study, scientists analyzed genetic information from more than 600,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia to determine how genes affect life span. \nFor example, certain genes are associated with increased alcohol consumption and addiction, the study authors explained. \nSmoking and traits associated with lung cancer had the greatest effect on shortening life expectancy. The researchers determined that smoking a pack of cigarettes each day over a lifetime leads to an average loss of seven years of life. \nBut the good news was that smokers who quit the habit lived as long as people who never smoked, according to the report. \nThe investigators also found that body fat and other factors linked to diabetes reduce life expectancy. For every excess 2.2 pounds a person carries, life expectancy is cut by two months, the findings showed. \nPeople who are open to new experiences and who have higher levels of learning also tend to live longer, the researchers said. Every year spent studying beyond school added almost a year to a person's life span. \nWilson and colleagues also found that differences in a gene that affects blood cholesterol levels can reduce life span by around eight months, and differences in a gene linked to the immune system can add about half a year to life expectancy. \nThe study was published Oct. 13 in the journal Nature Communications . \nSOURCE: University of Edinburgh, news release, Oct. 13, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim wilson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature communications", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T20:35:42.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "033bd30611bb95b8a9d1c822b4581489c4a708c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0fZKdjZCNb7AThywL6zPP7U-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Need Cancer Screening?

Where You Work Matters Americans employed in smaller businesses often lack insurance coverage, study finds   01/11/2018) By Robert Preidt Friday, October 13, 2017 \nFRIDAY, Oct. 13,   Waiters, contractors and other employees of America's small businesses are more likely to miss out on cancer screening, mostly because of a lack of insurance, new research shows. \n\"Workers employed at smaller organizations had substantially lower breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening rates\" compared to people working at larger corporations or organizations, American Cancer Society (ACS) researchers reported. \nAnd poorer insurance coverage accounted for much of these differences, said the team led by ACS researcher Stacey Fedewa. \nOne breast cancer specialist who reviewed the findings said the issue is an important one, because mammograms, colonoscopies and other screens can save lives -- not to mention health care dollars. \nSo it's crucial to \"find ways to ensure that workers in smaller companies have access to health care,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"This is a complicated problem, as some smaller businesses cannot afford to provide insurance to their workers due to the rising cost of premiums.\" \nIn the new report, the ACS team tracked 2010, 2013 and 2015 federal government data. The investigators found that, overall, screening rates for U.S. workers were 84 percent for cervical cancer, about 69 percent for breast cancer and 57 percent for colon cancer. \nBut those numbers fell precipitously for employees at companies with fewer than 25 workers -- they were much less likely be screened than those at companies with 500 or more workers. \nFedewa's team also found that people in food service, construction, production and sales occupations were less likely to be up to date with cervical screening (26 percent less likely), breast screening (28 percent) and colon cancer screening (30 percent) than people working in the health care industry, for example. \nThe differences in cancer screening rates among workers were mostly due to lower income and lack of insurance, the study authors said. \nDr. Cynara Coomer directs the Comprehensive Breast Center at Staten Island University Hospital, in New York City. Reading over the findings, she agreed that a number of factors -- lack of insurance, transportation issues, education -- keep many Americans from cancer screening. \n\"As health care professionals, we need to strive to educate all communities about the importance of screening for certain cancers,\" she said. \"In addition, we need to find a solution to provide people of all socioeconomic levels access to medical care.\" \nThe findings were published Oct. 13 in the journal Preventive Medicine . \nSOURCES: Stephanie Bernik, M.D., chief, surgical oncology, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York City; Cynara Coomer, M.D., director chief of breast surgery and director, Comprehensive Breast Center, Staten Island University Hospital, New York City; American Cancer Society, news release, Oct. 12, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fedewa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stacey fedewa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie bernik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cynara coomer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "acs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "comprehensive breast center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "preventive medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "staten island university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenox hill hospital", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T20:35:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b978d151ae15404fcd613c6fe0a6ea652da7166f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0QCrNkWhOfu3R.mYBSgk_kE-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Women Falling Short on Birth Defect Prevention", "title_full": "Women Falling Short on Birth Defect Prevention", "published": "2017-10-13T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b978d151ae15404fcd613c6fe0a6ea652da7166f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0QCrNkWhOfu3R.mYBSgk_kE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Women Falling Short on Birth Defect Prevention", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169085.html Women Falling Short on Birth Defect Prevention New survey finds too few are taking folic acid before pregnancy (*this news item will not be available after 01/11/2018) Friday, October 13, 2017 \nFRIDAY, Oct. 13, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Only a third of women are taking a multivitamin containing folic acid -- a nutrient known to prevent serious birth defects -- before they know they're pregnant, a new survey has found. \nThe poll, conducted by the March of Dimes, also revealed significant racial disparities: Just 10 percent of black women and 27 percent of Hispanic women of childbearing age report taking multivitamins with folic acid before pregnancy. \n\"One of the things that's striking for us is how much more we need to make sure women understand the importance of being healthy before pregnancy,\" said Stacey Stewart, president of the March of Dimes Foundation. \n\"Half of all pregnancies are unexpected, which means women of childbearing age need to be doing all they can to be healthy in the event they do get pregnant,\" she said. \nIn the United States, more than 120,000 babies -- about 3 percent of all births -- will be born with birth defects this year, including about 3,000 babies born with neural tube defects, according to March of Dimes estimates. \nUp to 70 percent of the neural tube defects, which affect the brain and spine, could be prevented if all women of childbearing age took daily multivitamins containing folic acid, the group said. \nThe survey on prenatal health measures, conducted online in August 2017 by The Harris Poll on behalf of the March of Dimes, polled a nationally representative sample of more than 1,000 U.S. women, 18 to 45 years of age. It also found that: 77 percent of women are concerned there may be changes to the U.S. health care system that may hamper access to prenatal care, 43 percent of women say that cost affects when and whether they seek prenatal care, nearly two-thirds of women identify folic acid as an important nutrient in birth defect prevention, and only 40 percent identify iron, calcium and vitamin D as other vitamins important for this purpose, 97 percent of women report taking prenatal vitamins or multivitamins during a pregnancy, 13 percent of women do not know that avoiding smoking or tobacco products reduces the risk for birth defects, and 12 percent are unaware that eliminating drinking and illegal drugs would do the same. \nStewart said that the number of women concerned about possible changes to the U.S. health care system, as well as costs, points to a serious regard for their access to proper care for themselves and their pregnancies. \n\"At the March of Dimes, we work very hard to make sure that members of Congress, especially over the last several months, understand how important it is to take into account the health of women and mothers, and the impact health care changes would have on pregnancies and newborn babies,\" she said. \n\"We have to make sure the most vulnerable in our country are safe and protected, and that certainly has to be true for babies,\" Stewart added. \nDr. Michael Pirics, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas, said he wasn't surprised by the new survey findings, noting that many women don't seek preconception care \"either because they don't know that kind of thing is important or they're not getting regular gynecological checkups where it's addressed.\" He was not involved with the survey. \nPirics called the revelation of racial and ethnic disparities in multivitamin use among women of childbearing age \"one snapshot of a larger problem\" that he also found not surprising. All women in this age group should discuss taking folic acid-containing vitamins with their doctors well before conception, he said. \n\"But the idea of prevention is an overarching concern that should be more valued in our society,\" Pirics added. \"We should be encouraging women to continue getting regular health visits, both for their own health and the health of their potential pregnancies in the future.\" \nSOURCES: Stacey Stewart, president, March of Dimes Foundation, White Plains, N.Y.; Michael Pirics, M.D., obstetrician-gynecologist, Houston Methodist Hospital, Texas; \"Prenatal Health & Nutrition\" survey, March of Dimes, August 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

With this disorder the heart chambers enlarge and heart muscle weakens, leading to reduced blood flow that affects the lungs, liver and other organs. \nResearchers analyzed the medical records of 220 women diagnosed with PPCM. Black women with PPCM were younger (age 27 vs. 31), had more severe disease, and took longer to recover than white, Hispanic or Asian women. \n\"Not only are African-American women at twice the risk, but in this study we found they also took twice as long to recover, they were twice as likely to worsen before getting better after diagnosis, and they were twice as likely to fail to recover altogether, meaning their heart failure persisted for months following delivery,\" said senior author Dr. Zoltan Arany in a University of Pennsylvania news release. He is an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine and director of the university's Cardiovascular Metabolism Program. \nThe study \"opens the door for even more research on this subject, to find out why these women are more at risk,\" study author Dr. Jennifer Lewey said. She's an assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine and director of the Penn Women's Cardiovascular Center. \nThe researchers don't know why these differences occur. Lewey suggested the increased risk might be due to genetics, socioeconomic status or access to care. Or it could be due to medical problems such as high blood pressure. \n\"Our next step will be to answer these questions, and identify how we can proactively diagnose and potentially prevent such a dangerous diagnosis in this at-risk patient population,\" Lewey said. \nThe study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association . \nSOURCE: University of Pennsylvania, news release, Oct. 11, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer lewey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zoltan arany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "penn women's cardiovascular center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardiovascular metabolism program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ppcm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T20:35:47.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08e5bbc98bd21e16244d42482a9d9e6ba1eb5d46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0UpsNBVvdSTMJvh9_d.7yVc-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "More Women Choose Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy", "title_full": "More Women Choose Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy", "published": "2017-10-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08e5bbc98bd21e16244d42482a9d9e6ba1eb5d46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0UpsNBVvdSTMJvh9_d.7yVc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "More Women Choose Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169091.html More Women Choose Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy Report highlights dramatic increase, notable trends   01/11/2018) By Robert Preidt Friday, October 13, 2017 \nFRIDAY, Oct. 13,   Over five years, the proportion of U.S. breast cancer patients opting for breast reconstruction after mastectomy grew by about two-thirds, a new government report shows. \nAn analysis of patient data shows breast reconstruction followed 40 percent of breast-removal surgeries in 2014 -- up from less than one-quarter in 2009, according to the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). \nAmong age groups, women aged 65 and older accounted for the largest increase in breast reconstructive surgery -- 140 percent. \n\"This type of information is essential for policymakers and health systems seeking to keep pace with important trends in clinical care,\" Gopal Khanna, agency director, said in an AHRQ news release. \nThe overall increase during the study period was 65 percent, researchers said. \nWhile reconstruction procedures increased in all insurance groups, the jump was highest for Medicare patients. Even so, the Medicare reconstruction rate was lowest -- 19 reconstructions per 100 mastectomies -- compared to other insurance plans. \nA dramatic rise in reconstruction surgeries also occurred among women without insurance, the data from 22 states revealed. \n\"This information suggests that many uninsured women were willing to pay for reconstruction surgery out of pocket,\" said Anne Elixhauser, a senior scientist at the agency. \nMedical, sexual and physical concerns come into play when deciding for or against breast reconstruction, according to the report. \n\"Medical considerations include concerns that breast reconstruction surgery lengthens recovery time and increases the chance for infection and other postoperative complications,\" the authors say. \n\"Sexual considerations involve the impact of the mastectomy on future sexual encounters. Physical features include how breasts may define femininity and sense of self,\" they noted. \nOther notable findings: Most of the growth in reconstructive procedures occurred in hospital-based outpatient surgical centers (150 percent increase). The rate for inpatient reconstructions remained unchanged. In 2014, reconstruction surgery was less common among women in rural areas than among those in cities. Black women were more likely to undergo breast reconstruction surgery in an inpatient setting and along with mastectomy than white and Hispanic women. \nSOURCE: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, news release, Oct. 10, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mastecto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne elixhauser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gopal khanna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "medicare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahrq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. agency for healthcare research and quality", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthcare research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T20:35:49.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b54a45ebaa7c12c588db934f3e9ec42012ba3c86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0YwqM_hf014FXKvAgp.e45U-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Nearly 4 in 10 U.S. Adults Now Obese", "title_full": "Nearly 4 in 10 U.S. Adults Now Obese", "published": "2017-10-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b54a45ebaa7c12c588db934f3e9ec42012ba3c86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0YwqM_hf014FXKvAgp.e45U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nearly 4 in 10 U.S. Adults Now Obese", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169089.html Nearly 4 in 10 U.S. Adults Now Obese CDC stats show growing epidemic that means more illness and health care costs, health experts say (*this news item will not be available after 01/11/2018) Friday, October 13, 2017 \nFRIDAY, Oct. 13, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Almost forty percent adults in the United States are now obese, continuing an ever-expanding epidemic of obesity that's expected to lead to sicker Americans and higher health care costs. \nAlmost four out of 10 adults and 18.5 percent of kids aged 2 to 19 now meet the clinical definition of obesity, according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThat's up from 30.5 percent of adults and 13.9 percent of children in 1999-2000, the CDC report noted. \nPublic health experts are concerned that the continuing rise in obesity will lead to greater numbers of people suffering from diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illnesses. \n\"We've made tremendous progress reducing deaths due to cardiovascular disease and stroke in our country. Part of that is due to treatment. Part of that is due to the tremendous reduction in tobacco use,\" said Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, chief medical officer for the American Heart Association. \"But we've worried if obesity trends stayed or worsened that some of those gains might be reduced.\" \nObesity is defined as a body mass index of 30 or more. A 6-foot-tall man weighing 221 pounds is considered obese, as is a 5-foot-9 woman weighing 203 pounds. \nThe increase in youth obesity is of particular concern because these children are at greater risk for lifelong health problems, said Dr. Seema Kumar, a childhood obesity specialist with the Mayo Clinic. \nKumar said she regularly sees children with diseases that used to be considered adult-only, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and fatty liver disease. \n\"Because rates of obesity are so high, despite all the advances we're seeing, our children may live less healthy and shorter lives than their parents,\" Kumar said. \"We're going to have a much higher number of adults with diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease down the line.\" \nSome trends within the overall increase in obesity also have health experts worried. \nFor example, Sanchez noted, obesity appears to be more prevalent in ethnic groups that are growing rapidly in the United States. \nAbout 47 percent of Hispanic and black adults are obese, compared with 38 percent of whites and 13 percent of Asians, the researchers found. \n\"The demographic profile of our country is shifting in such a way that the burden of obesity will continue to grow unless we address these disparities,\" Sanchez said. \"We're still going to be heading in a challenging direction.\" \nDiana Thomas, a fellow with The Obesity Society, pointed out that the rise in youth obesity also is likely to continue because obese adults tend to mate, reproduce more often, and produce children that also struggle with excess weight. \n\"That next generation that's coming in with a high prevalence of obesity will probably continue to affect us in the future,\" said Thomas, who is a professor of mathematical sciences at West Point. \nRates of obesity increase with age, the investigators found. Close to 43 percent of middle-aged adults are obese, compared with about 36 percent of younger adults, nearly 21 percent of teenagers and 14 percent of children aged 2 to 5. \nStemming the obesity epidemic will involve action at both the personal and the community level, Sanchez and Kumar said. \nFamily-based programs are available that teach young parents how to cook healthy meals, Kumar said. These programs teach healthy eating habits that kids will model once they see their parents setting an example. \n\"If we can teach our families to eat healthy, that would probably be the most important thing we could do,\" Kumar said. \nCommunities also play a crucial role. They can help by adopting policies that encourage a healthy diet and more physical activity, Sanchez suggested. These might include: Healthier food and drinks in vending machines in schools and businesses. Improving accessibility to healthy foods by promoting farmers' markets. Designing neighborhoods to be more walkable and bike-friendly. Promoting physical activity for kids both in and outside of school. \n\"It's not just about giving people information,\" Sanchez said. \"It's about helping individuals and their families adopt different behaviors, and make it easier for them to do so.\" \nThe report, by Dr. Craig Hales and colleagues at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), was published in the October issue of the CDC's NCHS Data Brief . \nSOURCES: Eduardo Sanchez, M.D., MPH, chief medical officer, American Heart Association; Seema Kumar, M.D., childhood obesity specialist, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.; Diana Thomas, Ph.D., fellow, Obesity Society and professor, mathematical sciences, West Point, N.Y.; Oct. 13, 2017, NCHS Data Brief HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

In addition, black women were more likely to have tumors that were larger, more advanced and hormone receptor-negative. \nIf a tumor is hormone receptor-positive, that means its growth is fueled by certain hormones, according to the ACS. There are medications that can lower hormone levels that help keep these cancers at bay. Compared with hormone receptor-positive cancers, hormone receptor-negative cancers tend to grow faster and have fewer treatment options. \nAmong women with hormone receptor-positive tumors, black women were twice as likely to die as white women. Insurance accounted for 37 percent of that increased risk among black women, followed by tumor characteristics (23 percent), other health conditions (11 percent), and treatment (5 percent), the researchers said. \nAmong women with hormone receptor-negative tumors, black women had a 50 percent higher risk of death than white women did. Insurance accounted for 34 percent of black women's increased risk, followed by tumor characteristics (22 percent), other health conditions (4 percent), and treatment (4 percent). \n\"Health policy makers should ensure that the benefits of important scientific advances in prevention, early detection and treatment of breast cancer are made available to all women, especially black women, who experience an undue share of the mortality burden from this disease,\" the study authors said. \nEqualizing access to care for non-elderly black women could help reduce the disparities in the death rates of women diagnosed with breast cancer, Jemal's team concluded. \nThe study was published Oct. 16 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . \nSOURCE: American Cancer Society, news release, Oct. 16, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "healthday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahmedin jemal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jemal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "acs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national library of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T22:14:20.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33380df9d5238c48180903522e49d8d1a1416eaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0YxYS.l9S30gML7yYrHyi94-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "", "title": "Homicides Devastate Black Communities, But Prevention Gets Little Funding: MedlinePlus Health News", "title_full": "Homicides Devastate Black Communities, But Prevention Gets Little Funding: MedlinePlus Health News", "published": "2017-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.208, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "33380df9d5238c48180903522e49d8d1a1416eaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0YxYS.l9S30gML7yYrHyi94-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robert Preidt", "published": "2017-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Homicides Devastate Black Communities, But Prevention Gets Little Funding: MedlinePlus Health News", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169115.html Homicides Devastate Black Communities, But Prevention Gets Little Funding Discrepancy hurts black Americans more than whites, researchers say   01/14/2018) By Robert Preidt Monday, October 16, 2017 \nMONDAY, Oct. 16,   Homicide is the leading cause of early death among black Americans, a new study points out. \nYet killings in the United States gets a disproportionately low share of federal research funding compared to the leading causes of death among whites, said study author Molly Rosenberg. \n\"Homicide is, unfortunately, a common cause of premature death, and black Americans are more likely to be affected by homicide than white Americans,\" said Rosenberg. She is an assistant professor at Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington. \n\"Homicide-related deaths in America, most of which are caused by firearms, constitute a public health crisis,\" Rosenberg said in a university news release. \n\"Yet when we look at what kind of public health research gets funded and published, we find homicide to be conspicuously absent,\" she added. \nRosenberg and her colleagues evaluated the leading causes of death in 2015 by race in the United States. They also looked at publicly funded research projects. \nAmong whites, homicide is the 12th leading cause of early death, or potential years of life lost. This refers to the number of years people would have lived had they not died of a particular cause. \nThe researchers found that heart disease -- the top cause of potential years of life lost among whites -- received 341 grants and almost 600 publications during 2015. \nResearch on homicide, on the other hand, garnered just a handful of federal grants and publications, the study authors noted. \n\"Homicide research is dramatically under-represented in public health research in terms of grant funding and publications. This lack of investment threatens to perpetuate a system that disadvantages the health of black Americans,\" Rosenberg said. \n\"The more premature a death, the greater the loss in economic productivity for the family, community and society. This loss of human potential can push families into poverty and societies toward heightened inequality,\" she added. \nThe study also found differences between blacks and whites in the potential years of life lost to all causes of death. For example, the average age of death from a birth defect was 15 years among blacks and 26 years among whites. And suicides occurred 10 years earlier on average among blacks -- at 38, versus 48 years of age among whites, according to the study. \nOverall, the more than 2.7 million deaths in the United States in 2015 resulted in nearly 21.4 million potential years of life lost. Blacks accounted for 20 percent of these years even though they make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population, the researchers explained. \nThe study was published Oct. 10 in the journal PLoS One . \nSOURCE: Indiana University, news release, Oct. 10, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "healthday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "molly rosenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosenberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "indiana university school of public health-bloomington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national library of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T03:16:54.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfd182033205748b8adc2701231022a29cf65f35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0ds8D4e54aUojj541RDNjCM-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "1 in 9 American Men Infected with Oral HPV", "title_full": "1 in 9 American Men Infected with Oral HPV", "published": "2017-10-17T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfd182033205748b8adc2701231022a29cf65f35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0ds8D4e54aUojj541RDNjCM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-17T00:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "1 in 9 American Men Infected with Oral HPV", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169110.html 1 in 9 American Men Infected With Oral HPV Vaccine provides protection, but number of boys getting shots remains low, researchers say   Monday,   Eleven million American men are infected with oral human papillomavirus (HPV), which can lead to cancers of the head, neck and throat, a new study reports. \nThat equates to 1 in 9 U.S. males aged 18 to 69. And infection is most likely for those who have had multiple oral sexual partners, are gay or bisexual, or who also have genital HPV infection, a team of U.S. researchers found. \nThe most common cancer caused by the sexually transmitted virus is oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, a head and neck cancer that's far more common in men than women, according to the study. \n\"The incidence of this cancer has increased 300 percent in the last 20 years,\" said lead researcher Ashish Deshmukh. He's a research assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions. \nDeshmukh and colleagues used 2011-2014 data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. \nThey found that nearly 12 percent of men and about 3 percent of women were infected with oral HPV. \nNearly 2 million men had high-risk HPV 16, a strain that causes most of the cancers, Deshmukh said. This type was six times more common in men than women. \nAlthough an effective HPV vaccine exists for both boys and girls, the number of boys getting their shots remains low. Also, many at-risk males are older than 26 and don't qualify for the vaccine -- or have already been exposed to the virus, the researchers noted. \nThe HPV vaccine is recommended before the start of sexual activity. All kids 11 or 12 should get two shots six to 12 months apart, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. \nIn 2014, about 57 percent of girls but only 35 percent of boys had been vaccinated, according to the CDC. \n\"We've got to vaccinate young boys, because vaccine has the potential to decrease cancer risk,\" Deshmukh said. \nEven if all young boys are vaccinated, however, it will be years before a significant decrease in head and neck cancers is seen, he said. \n\"In the short term, we need to find alternate prevention methods, for example, screening people and identifying precancerous lesions that can be treated,\" Deshmukh said. \nThe report was published online Oct. 16 in the Annals of Internal Medicine . \nAccording to 2013-2014 CDC research, more than 45 percent of men were infected with genital HPV, which is more common than the oral type. At the same time, about 40 percent of women carried genital HPV. \nGenital HPV can cause cancer of the anus, penis and vagina. Vaginal HPV causes about 70 percent of all cases of cervical cancer, the CDC says. \nOne specialist said a lot of unknowns surround oral HPV. \n\"The prevalence of oral HPV is much lower than genital HPV, and we don't understand that,\" said Patti Gravitt, a professor in the department of global health at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. \nIt's also not clear why men have more oral HPV than women, she said. Moreover, rates of oral HPV are higher in younger and older people, and that, too, is not understood, said Gravitt, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. \nFortunately, we have a very effective vaccine,\" she said. \nUnfortunately, many doctors aren't recommending the vaccine, Gravitt said. \nHPV vaccine prevents cancer, and \"the data are remarkable,\" she said. \"Rarely in a vaccine have you seen such strong effectiveness. ... It's safe,\" Gravitt said. \"We should be doing a better job of protecting people from HPV.\" \nSOURCES: Ashish Deshmukh, Ph.D., research assistant professor, department of health services research, management and policy, University of Florida, Gainesville; Patti Gravitt, Ph.D., professor, department of global health, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.; Oct. 16, 2017, Annals of Internal Medicine , online  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patti gravitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deshmukh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gravitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashish deshmukh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "george washington university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. national health and nutrition examination survey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of florida college of public health and health professions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "internal medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gainesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T12:39:13.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfb711fd15091fc224d0766065a71a1dd3e842ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0eugow5M9ybEsMUiZNgfae0-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "With Skin Cancer Surgery, Insurance Matters", "title_full": "With Skin Cancer Surgery, Insurance Matters", "published": "2017-10-16T21:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfb711fd15091fc224d0766065a71a1dd3e842ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0eugow5M9ybEsMUiZNgfae0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-16T21:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "With Skin Cancer Surgery, Insurance Matters", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169113.html With Skin Cancer Surgery, Insurance Matters Wait could be more than 6 weeks longer than those with private insurance, study says   By Mary Elizabeth Dallas Monday,   Surgery is the main treatment for melanoma -- a dangerous form of skin cancer -- but a patient's insurance could affect whether or not that cancer is quickly removed, new research suggests. \nAfter reviewing thousands of melanoma cases, researchers at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center reported that patients with Medicaid were more likely to face delays in scheduling their surgery than those with private insurance. \nMedicaid is the federally funded health insurance program for poor and needy people. \n\"The primary treatment for most melanoma is surgical excision, which can be curative,\" said study author Dr. Ade Adamson, a clinical instructor in the UNC School of Medicine's department of dermatology. \n\"These delays in care are concerning, particularly if they disproportionately affect those who might be the most vulnerable, such as Medicaid patients,\" he said in a hospital news release. \nResearchers reviewed the records of almost 8,000 patients from North Carolina. All had been diagnosed with melanoma between 2004 and 2011. Patients had private health insurance, Medicaid or Medicare, the health insurance program for those 65 and older. Specifically, the study examined the amount of time between the patients' diagnoses and their surgery. \nThe study showed that the patients with Medicaid were 36 percent more likely than those with private insurance to experience surgical delays. Folks with Medicaid were also more likely to wait more than six weeks for their surgery after being told that they had melanoma. Delays were also more common among patients who were not white. \nThe patients least likely to wait for melanoma surgery were those with private insurance. Those who were diagnosed or operated on by a dermatologist were also less likely to face surgical delays, according to the findings. \nThe researchers noted that Medicaid patients often lack access to dermatologists and may have trouble getting referrals for specialists, which could increase their risk for delays. \n\"We have identified insurance type as a factor associated with timeliness of care delivered to patients with melanoma,\" said Dr. Nancy Thomas, chair of the School of Medicine's department of dermatology. \nThe authors said more research is needed to determine what is causing the delays in melanoma surgery. \n\"Once we figure this out we can think about ways to construct an intervention to make sure patients with this potentially deadly cancer get the timely, appropriate care they deserve,\" Adamson said. \nThe study was published in JAMA Dermatology . \nSOURCE: UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, news release, Oct. 4, 2017  ", "highlightText": "",

families than recent immigrants, study finds   By Robert Preidt Monday,   Hispanic children from U.S. native families are more likely to face difficult experiences such as parental divorce and exposure to violence than those in immigrant Hispanic families, a new study finds. \nHowever, the analysis of data from more than 12,000 Hispanic children across the United States found that kids from immigrant families were more likely to experience poverty. \nRates of what the researchers called adverse childhood experiences were 56 percent among U.S.-born Hispanic children and 47 percent among those in immigrant families. \nAmong Hispanic children in immigrant families, 12 percent experienced parental divorce and 32 percent experienced poverty, while among kids born in the United States, 25.5 percent experienced divorce and nearly 30 percent experienced poverty. \nHispanic children in immigrant families may have a higher level of resiliency due to strong community networks and a strong sense of cultural identity, said senior author Dr. Lisa DeCamp, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. \n\"These findings suggest family and community factors at play that help children in immigrant families buffer the effects of adverse childhood experiences, and that whatever these resiliency factors are, we should work towards protecting and extending them to subsequent nonimmigrant generations,\" DeCamp said in a school news release. \nThe study was published in the October issue of the journal Pediatrics .

the heart rhythm disorder, study says   By Robert Preidt Monday,   Men develop a dangerous type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation a decade earlier than women, a new study suggests. \nAnd while being overweight increased odds for the condition in both sexes, those extra pounds were more troublesome for males, the German researchers found. \n\"It's crucial to better understand modifiable risk factors of atrial fibrillation,\" said study author Dr. Christina Magnussen. \n\"If prevention strategies succeed in targeting these risk factors, we expect a noticeable decline in new-onset atrial fibrillation,\" added Magnussen, a specialist in internal medicine and cardiology at the University Heart Center in Hamburg. \nA-fib means the upper chambers of the heart, or atria, quiver instead of beat. In the new 13-year study, the condition tripled the odds of dying prematurely. \nAccording to the American Heart Association statistics, as many as 6 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, with those numbers likely doubling by 2030. \nIn this study, researchers examined the medical records of nearly 80,000 people, aged 24 to 97, in Europe who initially did not have atrial fibrillation. Later assessments showed that more than 6 percent of men and over 4 percent of women had been diagnosed with a-fib. \nRisk of diagnosis accelerated sharply in men after 50 and in women after 60. By age 90, nearly one-quarter of men and women were told they had atrial fibrillation, the study found. \nThe researchers also found a link between atrial fibrillation and higher blood levels of an inflammation marker called C-reactive protein. \nIn addition, the association between atrial fibrillation and being overweight or obese was stronger in men (31 percent) than in women (18 percent), they reported. \nThe study was published Oct. 16 in the journal Circulation . \n\"We advise weight reduction for both men and women. As elevated body mass index seems to be more detrimental for men, weight control seems to be essential, particularly in overweight and obese men,\" Magnussen said in a journal news release. \nSOURCE: Circulation , news release, Oct. 16, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christina magnussen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "magnussen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "american heart association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university heart center", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T12:39:44.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7aebcc5da9f4b37b8a8d51700f38afefe11b68a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0WKTbEtleHnUM0Bp7tqDeaY-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Nearly a Third of College Kids Think ADHD Meds Boost Grades", "title_full": "Nearly a Third of College Kids Think ADHD Meds Boost Grades", "published": "2017-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a7aebcc5da9f4b37b8a8d51700f38afefe11b68a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0WKTbEtleHnUM0Bp7tqDeaY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nearly a Third of College Kids Think ADHD Meds Boost Grades", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169111.html Nearly a Third of College Kids Think ADHD Meds Boost Grades But adolescent health experts say there's no evidence to support that belief   Monday,   Many college students who abuse ADHD drugs mistakenly believe that doing so will lead to better grades, a new survey suggests. \nPast research has found that college students commonly misuse stimulant medications such as Ritalin and Adderall as \"study aids.\" That's despite the fact that there is no evidence the drugs help kids who do not have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). \nThe new study said that roughly 29 percent of students at nine U.S. colleges thought that stimulant medications boost school performance. Many others -- 38 percent -- were \"unsure.\" \nAnd that misperception was especially common among students who admitted to abusing the drugs. \nJust over 11 percent said they'd used stimulant medication for \"non-medical\" reasons in the past six months. And of that group, almost two-thirds believed the drugs would improve their grades. \nThe findings came as no surprise to Dr. Jess Shatkin, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City. \nBut they do highlight an ongoing issue, according to Shatkin, who wasn't involved in the study. \n\"When kids do not actually have ADHD, these drugs are not helpful for their school performance,\" Shatkin said. \nMore concerning, he said, are the risks of misusing the medications -- such as altered heart rate and blood pressure, insomnia, heightened anxiety, and even hallucinations. \n\"So no, we do not want students abusing these drugs,\" Shatkin said. \nHow do you stop them? It's possible, according to Shatkin, that if more college kids are aware of the reality -- that their grades will not see a Ritalin-fueled rise -- then fewer will try the drugs. \nBut, he said, the medications are effective at one thing: Helping harried college students stay up later. \n\"So they'll at least finish that paper that's due tomorrow -- even if they won't get better grades,\" Shatkin said. \nIt all points to wider issues, according to Shatkin: Many college students need help with basics like time management, dealing with stress, and knowing how to generally take care of themselves. \nDr. Matthew Lorber is director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City. \nHe said stimulant abuse is a common problem not just among college students, but high school kids as well. \nWhen Lorber prescribes stimulants for children with ADHD, he encourages parents to \"hold on\" to the drugs themselves. That will limit the chances of their child sharing the drugs with their friends. \nHe also counsels teens on the risks of medication-sharing once they are on their own at college. \n\"We need to be discussing the dangers of these drugs for people who don't have ADHD,\" said Lorber, who wasn't part of the study team. \nThe findings are based on a survey of almost 7,300 college students. None had ever been diagnosed with ADHD. \nOverall, students who believed that stimulants improve school performance were 2.5 times more likely to abuse the drugs, versus their peers who were \"unsure.\" And students in that unsure group were about twice as likely to misuse stimulants as those who did not believe the medications helped with grades. \nLike Shatkin, Lorber said that trying to disabuse kids of that notion is unlikely to be enough. \n\"But,\" he said, \"it's information they should have -- along with information on the risks of misusing stimulants.\" \nHe encouraged parents to talk to their kids about those dangers, just as they would when it comes to alcohol or illegal drugs. \nShatkin recommended the discussions be even broader than that. \"What do you do when you're depressed? What do you do when you're stressed? We often don't have these conversations with kids,\" he said. \nShatkin also suggested that parents be mindful about how much pressure they put on their kids to succeed at school. \"We don't want them to catastrophize over every grade,\" he said. \nThe study was published earlier this year in the journal Addictive Behaviors . \nSOURCES: Matthew Lorber, M.D., director, child and adolescent psychiatry, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York City; Jess Shatkin, M.D., M.P.H., professor, child and adolescent psychiatry, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York City; July 14, 2017, Addictive Behaviors , online  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lorber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shatkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jess shatkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew lorber", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nyu langone medical center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenox hill hospital", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T12:39:46.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16e95b7d997c780055e4bd84ee1f75f516f811ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0XlXzyEiT8gt6tYmibVDZbc-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "When Should You Rush Your Toddler to The ER?", "title_full": "When Should You Rush Your Toddler to The ER?", "published": "2017-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16e95b7d997c780055e4bd84ee1f75f516f811ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0XlXzyEiT8gt6tYmibVDZbc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "When Should You Rush Your Toddler to The ER?", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169117.html When Should You Rush Your Toddler to the ER? For choking or possible poisoning, poll finds many parents need an emergency refresher course (*this news item will not be available after 01/14/2018) By Robert Preidt Monday, October 16, 2017 \nMONDAY, Oct. 16, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Many American parents aren't sure when to rush their child to the emergency room, a new survey finds. \n\"When young children experience urgent medical situations, parents have to make decisions about whether to administer first aid at home, call for advice or seek emergency care,\" said Dr. Gary Freed, from the University of Michigan. He is co-director of the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital Poll on Children's Health. \n\"Our report suggests that some parents may be using the ER for common situations that could be handled at home,\" Freed said in a university news release. \"Determining what is in fact an 'emergency' can be a confusing and nerve-wracking experience for parents who want to make the right decision.\" \nResearchers questioned nearly 400 parents with at least one child aged 5 or younger. \nThey found only half would know what to do if their child was choking, 10 percent would take their child to the ER for a minor burn from a hot pan, and nearly one-third would take their child to the ER for swallowed pills. \nBut going to the ER may do more harm than good in certain situations. For example, a child who is choking requires immediate help instead of waiting for treatment at the ER, Freed explained. \nThe poll found that 8 percent of parents would go directly to the ER if their child were choking, while 29 percent said they would call 911. \nOthers faced with choking would use methods such as the Heimlich maneuver (69 percent) to try to dislodge the object or try to remove the object with their finger (54 percent). Nearly half said they would hit the child on the back, while one-quarter would turn the child upside down. \nIf their child swallowed medication not meant for them, more than half of parents said they would try to remove any pills from the child's mouth and one-quarter would make the child throw up. Six out of 10 said they would call Poison Control, while one-quarter would call their child's doctor. Twenty-six percent would call 911, and almost one-third would rush the child to the ER. \n\"Generally, calling Poison Control is an excellent first step to take if a parent suspects their child swallowed something harmful,\" Freed said. \n\"Poison Control staff are trained to get important information from parents about the type of medication their child might have swallowed and direct them on the next steps to take,\" he said. \nParents who rush to the ER might forget to bring the source of the possible poisoning, leaving ER providers with limited information to determine the child's treatment, he added. \nThe poll highlights the need for parents to get first aid training. \nThe 43 percent of parents with no first aid training were less confident in making decisions about urgent situations than those with training. Just 10 percent of parents had received first aid training within the past year; 24 percent were trained within the past five years, and 23 percent had training more than five years ago. \n\"In some cases, such as a small burn, parents would likely be able to consult a first aid resource to guide their response. Other situations, like choking, are clearly more time-sensitive and require immediate action. First aid training can help parents stay calm and manage the situation more effectively,\" Freed said. \nSOURCE: University of Michigan, news release, Oct. 16, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Artificial intelligence technology predicted 97 percent of malignancies in study (*this news item will not be available after 01/15/2018) Tuesday, October 17, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 17, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Machines armed with artificial intelligence may one day help doctors better identify high-risk breast lesions that might turn into cancer, new research suggests. \nHigh-risk breast lesions are abnormal cells found in a breast biopsy. These lesions pose a challenge to doctors and patients. The cells in such lesions aren't normal, but they're not cancerous either. And although they can develop into cancer, many don't. So, which ones need to be removed? \n\"The decision about whether or not to proceed to surgery is challenging, and the tendency is to aggressively treat these lesions [and remove them],\" said study author Dr. Manisha Bahl. \n\"We felt like there must be a better way to risk-stratify these lesions,\" added Bahl, director of the breast imaging fellowship program at Massachusetts General Hospital. \nWorking closely with computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, researchers developed a \"machine-learning\" model to distinguish high-risk lesions that need to be surgically removed from those that could just be watched over time. \nMachine learning is a type of artificial intelligence. The computer model automatically learns and improves based on previous experiences, the researchers explained. \nThe researchers gave the machine a lot of information about established risk factors, such as the type of lesion and patient age. The researchers also fed it the actual text from the biopsy report. Overall, there were 20,000 data elements included in the model, the researchers said. \nThe test of the machine-learning model included information from slightly more than 1,000 women who had a high-risk lesion. About 96 percent of these women had their lesion surgically removed. Approximately 4 percent of women didn't have their lesions removed, but instead had two years of follow-up imaging tests. \nThe model was trained with two-thirds of the cases, and tested on the remaining third. \nThe test included 335 lesions. The machine correctly identified 37 of the 38 lesions (97 percent) that had developed into cancer, the study said. The model also would have helped women avoid one-third of surgeries on lesions that would have remained benign during the follow-up period. \nIn addition, Bahl said, \"the model picked up on text in the biopsy report -- the words severely and severely atypical conferred a higher risk of upgrade to cancer.\" \nBahl said the researchers are hoping to incorporate mammography images and pathology slides into the machine learning model, with the goal of eventually including this in clinical practice. \n\"Machine learning is a tool that we can use to improve patient care -- whether that means reducing unnecessary surgeries or being able to provide more information to patients so they can make more informed decisions,\" Bahl said. \nDr. Bonnie Litvack is medical director of the women's imaging center at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mt. Kisco, N.Y. \n\"Women should know that there is a new type of machine learning that's helped us identify high-risk lesions at low risk of cancer. And, we may soon have more information for them when they're faced with the decision of whether to have surgery to excise these high-risk lesions or not,\" said Litvak, who wasn't involved in the study. \n\"Artificial intelligence is an exciting field that will help us give women more data and help with shared decision-making,\" Litvack added. \nThe study was published Oct. 17 in Radiology . \nSOURCES: Manisha Bahl, M.D., M.P.H., director, breast imaging fellowship program, Massachusetts General Hospital, and assistant professor, radiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston; Bonnie Litvack, M.D., medical director, women's imaging center, Northern Westchester Hospital, Mt.

One shake contained high sugar and low fat, while the other had low sugar and high fat. \nThe first phase of the experiment involved 76 college students who were randomly given either a high-sugar or low-sugar shake to drink, and then provided potato chips to snack on while watching a video, the study authors said. \nThe researchers chose potato chips because they wanted to see if the sugar effect \"would transfer over to a different kind of snack,\" Mandel said. \nAs expected, the students who had the high-sugar shake ate more potato chips. \nIn the second phase, researchers explored whether changing participants' perception of the shakes' healthiness would influence their snacking habits. \nThe sugar and non-sugar shakes were randomly passed out to another group of 193 students, but this time they included labeling. \nSome shakes were labeled \"healthy living\" and carried nutrition information claiming they were low in fat, sugar and calories. Others labeled \"indulgent\" carried info showing they were high in fat, sugar and calories. \nPeople who drank a high-sugar shake labeled \"indulgent\" ate the least amount of potato chips, even fewer chips than people who drank low-sugar shakes marked as either \"healthy\" or \"indulgent.\" \nThose who drank a high-sugar shake labeled \"healthy\" ate more potato chips than any of the other three groups, the findings showed. \nMandel said she's particularly concerned about the impact from breakfast foods like cereal, yogurt or instant oatmeal, which are marketed as healthy but often contain loads of sugar. \n\"People think they're starting out having a healthy breakfast, but they may be setting themselves up to be hungry all day and eat too much over the course of a day because of that,\" Mandel said. \nDr. Reshmi Srinathe is   medicine, diabetes, endocrinology and bone disease with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. She said the study shows the importance of food labels and the need for stricter regulation of claims made by product manufacturers. \n\"Labeling matters,\" Srinath said. \"When people think something is healthy, they think it gives them a pass to make other food choices that may not be as healthy.\" \nSrinath and Mandel recommend that people read the Nutrition Facts label and ingredient list included on food packaging, and figure out for themselves whether a product is healthy or not. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is in the process of expanding the Nutrition Facts label to show the amount of added sugar in food, Mandel said. \n\"I think that's a good first step,\" Mandel said. \"Ideally, I would like to see more regulation of a marketing term claiming that a food is healthy or healthful. If it has a lot of added sugar, then it really should not be called healthy.\" \nThe study was published in the journal Appetite . \nSOURCES: Naomi Mandel, Ph.D., professor, marketing, Arizona State University, Tempe, Ariz.; Reshmi Srinath, M.D., assistant professor, medicine, diabetes, endocrinology and bone disease, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City; 2017, Appetite  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reshmi srinath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "srinath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naomi mandel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reshmi srinathe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "arizona state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icahn school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount sinai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariz.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tempe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T19:57:34.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6865bbb8f4967a4e5f7a9103d38f290ce1e1358", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0RoDBIh7uB2eWfOFE0Tm5Zk-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://pcomsociety.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "PCOM Society", "title": "Who\u2019s Most At Risk of Head Injury in Youth Football?", "title_full": "Who\u2019s Most At Risk of Head Injury in Youth Football?", "published": "2017-10-17T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6865bbb8f4967a4e5f7a9103d38f290ce1e1358", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0RoDBIh7uB2eWfOFE0Tm5Zk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sports Injuries New Links: MedlinePlus RSS Feed", "published": "2017-10-17T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Who\u2019s Most At Risk of Head Injury in Youth Football?", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169132.html Who's Most at Risk of Head Injury in Youth Football? Those involved in running, passing more vulnerable, study finds   01/15/2018) Tuesday, October 17, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 17,   Young football players are more likely to experience a brain-jarring hit to the head if they're part of a team's running and passing game or a fast-moving defender, a small study found. \nHigh-magnitude head impacts most often involve positions such as quarterback, running back and linebacker as those players sprint across an open field, Virginia Tech researchers concluded after watching a season of youth football in Blacksburg, Va. \nThese players experienced nearly twice the number of severe head hits as linemen did, the study reported. \n\"Players who are able to get up to speed prior to impact, players who are off the line of scrimmage, those players are more likely to experience a high-magnitude head impact,\" said lead researcher Eamon Campolettano. He is a graduate research assistant at the university's department of biomedical engineering and mechanics. \nCampolettano and his colleagues classified high-magnitude impacts as those amounting to greater than 40 times the force of gravity -- or 40 g . \nAbout 8 percent of the head impacts that occurred during youth play and practice were hard enough to be classified as high-magnitude, the researchers found. \nOne neurologist put that into perspective. \n\"That's equivalent to getting punched in the head by a boxer,\" said Dr. David Dodick, a professor of neurology with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. \"No one would want their 9-year-old or 11-year-old punched in the head or involved in a boxing match, but that's the kind of force some of these kids are exposed to regularly.\" \nAbout 70 percent of football players in the United States are elementary and middle school students, the researchers said in background notes. \nTheir investigation involved 45 players on two youth teams in leagues organized by the city of Blacksburg -- a Juniors team with fourth and fifth graders aged 9 to 11, and a Seniors team with sixth and seventh graders aged 11 to 13, Campolettano said. \nAll the players were given football helmets containing sensors that measure the force of an impact, Campolettano said. The researchers also videotaped each game so they could review how each head impact unfolded. \nDuring the youth season, the participating players endured 7,590 head impacts, out of which 571 exceeded 40 g . \n\"Backs\" players experienced 120 high-magnitude head impacts compared with 67 among linemen, the researchers found. Overall, the backs' rate of heavy head impacts was 3.1 for every 100 plays, compared with 1.7 per 100 plays for linemen. \nOverall, high-magnitude impacts in the open field accounted for about 59 percent of all severe head knocks during games and 67 percent of those that occurred during practice, the study reported. \nHigh-magnitude impacts occurred more often during games than during practice sessions for both teams. \n\"I guess that's not terribly surprising because the game situation is much more intense, with probably more speed and more physical contact,\" Dodick said. \"When you're playing a scrimmage amongst your own teammates, you're less likely to want to hit them hard than you are when you're playing another team.\" \nHowever, the researchers are concerned that because practices occur more often, they subject players to more opportunities to receive head impacts. \n\"These kids are practicing three to four times as often as they're playing the game,\" Campolettano said. \"If you really want to reduce head impact exposure, that effort could really be driven by changes at the practice level.\" \nAlthough only one player suffered a diagnosed concussion during the season, studies have indicated that multiple sub-concussive impacts could add up to long-term damage to the brain, Dodick and Campolettano said. \nYouth football could be made safer if practices were strictly non-tackle or heads-up tackle, and if trained coaches were brought in to teach proper technique to young players, Campolettano said. \nBut results like these show that youth football might be better off without tackling, Dodick said. \n\"We're seeing evidence the younger you expose kids to that kind of contact, the more likely it is they will have both psychiatric and neurological consequences down the road,\" Dodick said. \"These brains are developing. Kids this age are forming new connections in their brains all the time. If those connections are disrupted, that's going to have consequences for these kids.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 17 in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics . \nSOURCES: Eamon Campolettano, B.S., graduate research assistant, department of biomedical engineering and mechanics, Virginia Tech; David Dodick, M.D., professor, neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.; Oct. 17, 2017, Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david dodick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eamon campolettano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campolettano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dodick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "virginia tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayo clinic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rochester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blacksburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T19:57:36.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a26d3a132bdf15dbe2b9beb68bcf3d56c1c687b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0X8lxR17.pmGJmY8kngsah0-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://pcomsociety.com/feed", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "PCOM Society", "title": "Diabetes Pill Might Replace Injection to Control Blood Sugar", "title_full": "Diabetes Pill Might Replace Injection to Control Blood Sugar", "published": "2017-10-17T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a26d3a132bdf15dbe2b9beb68bcf3d56c1c687b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0X8lxR17.pmGJmY8kngsah0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Diabetes New Links: MedlinePlus RSS Feed", "published": "2017-10-17T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Diabetes Pill Might Replace Injection to Control Blood Sugar", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169135.html Diabetes Pill Might Replace Injection to Control Blood Sugar Global study shows blood glucose levels dropped significantly, and low rates of low blood sugar   01/15/2018) Tuesday, October 17, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 17,   An injectable class of diabetes medication -- called glucagon-like peptide-1 or GLP-1 -- might one day be available in pill form, research suggests. \nBased on the results of a global phase 2 clinical trial, the study authors reported a significant drop in blood sugar levels for people on the oral medication, and no significant increase in low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) compared to a placebo over six months. \nThe findings also showed that people taking the highest dose of the pill lost a large amount of weight -- about 15 pounds -- compared to a weight loss of fewer than 3 pounds for people on the inactive placebo pill. \nThe research was funded by Novo Nordisk, the company that makes the drug, called oral semaglutide. \n\"Semaglutide could transform diabetes treatment,\" said Dr. Robert Courgi, an endocrinologist at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y. \n\"Glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists are agents that are highly recommended according to diabetes guidelines, but rarely used because they require injection. Most patients prefer a pill,\" Courgi explained. \nDr. Joel Zonszein, director of the clinical diabetes center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, agreed that these new findings were exciting. \n\"This medication looks pretty good. The high dose matched the [injection] version. There was low hypoglycemia. It controls blood glucose. There was weight loss and it's not an injection. This is the same molecule that's been shown [as an injection] to decrease cardiovascular mortality,\" Zonszein said. \n\"It has all the ingredients for an excellent medication. If this comes to market, it would be very good for people with type 2 diabetes,\" he added. \nZonszein and Courgi were not involved in the current study. \nThe study included just over 1,100 people with type 2 diabetes recruited from 100 centers in 14 countries around the world. \nThe volunteers' average age was 57. The average time they'd had type 2 diabetes was six years. On average, they were considered obese. \nThe participants' average hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels were between 7 and 9.5 percent. HbA1C -- also called A1C -- is a measure of average blood sugar control over two to three months. The American Diabetes Association generally recommends an HbA1C of less than 7 percent for most people with type 2 diabetes. \nThe study volunteers were randomly placed into treatment groups that lasted 26 weeks. One group was given a once-weekly injection containing 1.0 milligram (mg) of semaglutide. Five groups were given one of five doses of oral semaglutide -- 2.5, 5, 10, 20 or 40 mg. Another group was given escalating doses of the pill version, starting with the smallest dose and ending at 40 mg. The final group was given an oral placebo. \nThe highest dose of the pill performed similarly to the injectable form as far as blood sugar control and weight loss. Those on the 40-mg oral dose and those who got the injection saw an average drop in their HbA1C of 1.9 percent, the study showed. More than 70 percent of those who took the pill saw a weight loss of at least 5 percent. \nAccording to the study's lead author, Dr. Melanie Davies, \"The A1C reductions and weight loss were very impressive and similar to what we've seen with the weekly injection of semaglutide.\" Davies is a professor of diabetes medicine at the Diabetes Research Centre at the University of Leicester in England. \nThe two forms of the drug were also similar in the reported side effects, which affected up to around 80 percent of those taking both forms of the drug. The most common side effects were mild to moderate digestive concerns that tended to go away with time. Nausea was less common in people who started on the lowest dose and then were given stronger doses. \nThere were three reported cases of pancreatitis -- inflammation of the pancreas -- a potentially serious condition that has been linked to this class of medication in previous studies. One person was taking the injectable form of the drug. The other two were on the oral drug -- 20 mg and 40 mg. \nZonszein noted that \"pancreatitis was a bit more in those who took the drug. This may be an issue we have to pay attention to, and it may help to start with a lower dose.\" \nHe also added that GLP-1 drugs, whether by injection or by mouth, should be given in combination with the standard first line type 2 diabetes drug metformin. \n\"We get more mileage from combining drugs and patients really do much better,\" Zonszein said. \nFindings from the study were published Oct. 17 in the Journal of the American Medical Association . Davies said phase 3 trials of the pill are already well under way. \nSOURCES: Melanie Davies, M.D., professor of diabetes medicine, Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, United Kingdom; Robert Courgi, M.D., endocrinologist, Southside Hospital, Bay Shore, N.Y.; Joel Zonszein, M.D., director, clinical diabetes center, Montefiore Medical Center, New York City; Oct. 17, 2017, Journal of the American Medical Association  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T02:50:41.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c56f4a1f66f9803e2c3dca0bd8afc58eb20f502e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0RtD1x23DKX3HAisJYYvz.o-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "", "title": "Scoliosis Screenings Can Help Catch Spine Problem Early: MedlinePlus Health News", "title_full": "Scoliosis Screenings Can Help Catch Spine Problem Early: MedlinePlus Health News", "published": "2017-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c56f4a1f66f9803e2c3dca0bd8afc58eb20f502e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0RtD1x23DKX3HAisJYYvz.o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Dallas", "published": "2017-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scoliosis Screenings Can Help Catch Spine Problem Early: MedlinePlus Health News", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169137.html Scoliosis Screenings Can Help Catch Spine Problem Early Treatments vary, depending on severity of the condition   01/15/2018) By Mary Elizabeth Dallas Tuesday, October 17, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 17,   Routine screenings for scoliosis, or curvature of the spine, help ensure the condition doesn't take a toll on children's health and self-esteem, according to an orthopedic specialist. \nOne out of every 25 children develops scoliosis, says Dr. Scott Sorenson, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Penn State Children's Hospital in Hershey, Pa. The condition usually occurs when kids reach their preteen years but it can happen in babies or toddlers. It's unclear what causes scoliosis but genetics may play a role, he added. \nGirls are more often affected than boys. As a result, the Scoliosis Research Society recommends that girls be screened twice for scoliosis and boys screened once during their developing years. \nScreening for scoliosis typically involves examining the back and looking for asymmetry, such as a shoulder or hip that is higher than the other. One side of the chest may also be more prominent, Sorenson explained. \n\"Initially, it's more of a physical observation,\" Sorenson said in a hospital news release. \"They don't usually complain of pain.\" \nScoliosis can range from mild to severe. X-rays can reveal the severity of the curvature. Mild cases of scoliosis typically don't affect people's health or limit their activity. \nVery severe cases could lead to reduced lung or heart function. Severe scoliosis can also increase children's risk for arthritis and take a toll on their self-esteem, Sorenson said. \nTreatment for scoliosis depends on the severity of the condition and the age of the patient. \nThe only treatment needed for spinal curves of less than 25 degrees is observation. Curves between 25 and 45 degrees usually require children to wear a brace for at least 13 hours each day for one or two years. This helps prevent the curve from getting worse or affecting growth. Surgery is usually considered once spinal curves reach 50 degrees, Sorenson said. \n\"That's the point where we'll usually see the curvature continue to increase no matter how mature your bones are,\" he said. \"Plus, it's easier and safer to fix a 50-degree curve than one that is 80 degrees.\" \nDuring scoliosis surgery, doctors realign the bones by placing screws at each level of the spine needing correction. These screws are attached to rods running along each side of the spine. \n\"Usually it occurs in the thoracic spine where your ribs are, so it's not a huge deal to fuse because that's already a pretty rigid part of the spine,\" Sorenson said. \"If we have to go lower in the back, it can affect motion and bending.\" \nYounger children are often placed in a full-torso cast that is changed every few months for up to 18 months. Preteens tend to grow too fast for their bones to be fused so surgeons may opt for a new technique that involves implanting growing rods along their spine. \nSorenson noted that while yoga, physical therapy and chiropractic care have some benefits, these treatments don't reverse or treat scoliosis. \"Those are all very important for helping with your posture, strength and overall conditioning,\" he said. \"But none of them have been scientifically proven to alter the course of scoliosis.\" \nSOURCE: Penn State Health, news release, Oct. 5, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "healthday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sorenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott sorenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary elizabeth dallas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "medlineplus health news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national library of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penn state health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scoliosis research society", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "penn state children's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hershey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T06:23:37.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "17d138daaf48833f680fa82c561388e0403bbb5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0azMmRExoVC9aa2THkeUxjg-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/topics/medicines.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "Medicines New Links: MedlinePlus RSS Feed", "title": "Skip Opioid Treatment for Migraine in The ER", "title_full": "Skip Opioid Treatment for Migraine in The ER", "published": "2017-10-18T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "17d138daaf48833f680fa82c561388e0403bbb5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0azMmRExoVC9aa2THkeUxjg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-18T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Skip Opioid Treatment for Migraine in The ER", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169164.html Skip Opioid Treatment for Migraine in the ER Non-narcotic drug far more effective in new study (*this news item will not be available after 01/16/2018) By Mary Elizabeth Dallas Wednesday, October 18, 2017 \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 18, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- For people seeking treatment for a migraine in the emergency room, a commonly prescribed opioid called hydromorphone (Dilaudid or Exalgo) doesn't seem to work as well as at least one other medication, a new study finds. \n\"People go to U.S. emergency departments 1.2 million times a year with migraine, and the opioid drug hydromorphone is used in 25 percent of these visits, yet there have been no randomized, high-quality studies on its use for acute migraine,\" said study author Dr. Benjamin Friedman. He is with the department of emergency medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. \nDoctors should consider available alternatives before giving patients the opioid painkiller, the study authors suggested in a news release from the American Academy of Neurology. \nFor the study, researchers investigated if opioid use led to addiction among 127 patients who made repeated trips to two emergency departments in New York for treatment of migraines. \nHalf of the people were treated with hydromorphone. The remaining patients were given prochlorperazine through an IV. This drug works by blocking the release of a brain chemical called dopamine. \nThe researchers looked at how many of the patients had migraine relief for at least 48 hours. The study was halted after the 127 patients were enrolled because the results showed that prochlorperazine worked dramatically better than hydromorphone. \nAfter 48 hours, 60 percent of the patients on prochlorperazine had prolonged headache relief, compared with 31 percent of the people treated with hydromorphone. In the emergency room, 31 percent of those who received hydromorphone asked for a second dose of the drug. The same was true for only 8 percent of those who received prochlorperazine. \nOf the patients on hydromorphone, 36 percent asked for other painkillers, compared with only 6 percent of the prochlorperazine group, according to the report. \nThere was no difference in how often the patients from both treatment groups returned to the ER due to a migraine within one month of the treatment, the researchers pointed out. \nFriedman noted that patients who had used opioids within the past 30 days or had a history of addiction to these drugs were excluded from the study. Therefore, the study participants may have been at lower risk for an opioid abuse problem than people in the general population. \n\"While this study demonstrates the overwhelming superiority of prochlorperazine over hydromorphone for initial treatment of acute migraine, the results do not suggest that treatment with IV opioids leads to long-term addiction,\" Friedman said. \n\"In addition, the results should not be used to avoid the use of opioids for people who have not responded well to anti-dopaminergic drugs [such as prochlorperazine],\" he added. \nThe study was published online Oct. 18 in the journal Neurology . \nSOURCE: American Academy of Neurology, news release, Oct. 18, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

Remote employees may also have a harder time separating work from their personal lives, and they can become socially isolated, researchers report. \n\"The upside for workers is that they are happier when they are not tied to a fixed place of work,\" said study author Alan Felstead, a research professor of social science at Cardiff University in Wales. \nBut, \"while workers love working remotely, working this way carries costs, in that work and home often overlap, and it may therefore be difficult for workers to turn off,\" Felstead added. \nComputers, smartphones and other advanced technology have allowed more Americans than ever to telecommute, said David Ballard, the American Psychological Association's assistant executive director for organizational excellence. \n\"Work is no longer somewhere you go from 9 to 5. It's something you do,\" said Ballard. \"With available technology, that means we don't necessarily have to be sitting at a desk in an office to do that.\" \nIn the United States, the share of workers performing some or all of their work from home has grown from a little less than 20 percent in 2003 to over 24 percent in 2015, Felstead and his colleagues said. \nWorkers are responding well to this newfound freedom, the researchers found in survey results of British employees: Seven out of 10 remote workers said they would not move to another company for higher pay, compared with six out of 10 brick-and-mortar employees. Telecommuters also were likelier than office workers to report their jobs as more pleasurable and stimulating. And they were significantly more enthusiastic about their jobs. \nThese findings mirror those of U.S. workforce surveys, Ballard said. \n\"People reported that being able to do that enhanced their productivity and gave them more flexibility,\" Ballard said of telecommuting. \nHowever, there are downsides. \n\"It is difficult for workers to draw boundaries between work and nonwork when work is no longer fixed to a particular place,\" Felstead said. \nRemote workers are more likely to worry about job problems than office workers, and often work longer hours, the researchers found. Nearly 40 percent of telecommuters said they often work extra time to get the job done, compared with 24 percent of office employees. \nTelecommuting \"makes it more difficult for them to stop thinking about work and take a break,\" Ballard said. \"That's really important for people's work stress levels ... They need to have time where they're not thinking about work.\" \nBallard recommends that telecommuters set boundaries like specific hours when they work, when they have their cell phone on, or when they will answer e-mails. \n\"There's no one right way to do it. It really depends on the individual and their needs and preferences,\" Ballard said. \nAnd it's important to communicate those boundaries to bosses and co-workers, he added. \nRemote workers also need to fight social isolation, both on a personal and professional level, Ballard said. They should use video conferencing and instant messaging to attend meetings or stay in touch, and regularly get out to do work elsewhere. \n\"Stay connected to members of your team,\" Ballard said. \"That's a challenge when somebody's telecommuting. It's easy to get isolated, and it's easy to be left out of the loop.\" \nFinally, telecommuters should remember to take regular breaks, and not get caught up in multitasking. \n\"We all think we're good at multitasking, but really we're just dividing our attention, which means it's taking us longer to get things done and we make more mistakes and errors,\" Ballard said. \nThe new review was published recently in the journal New Technology, Work and Employment . \nSOURCES: Alan Felstead, research professor, social science, Cardiff University, Wales, U.K.; David Ballard, Psy.D., assistant executive director, organizational excellence; American Psychological Association; Oct. 4, 2017, New Technology, Work and Employment HealthDay Copyright   More Health News on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ballard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david ballard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felstead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan felstead", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american psychological association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardiff university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T00:37:55.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "826f49a766af6fbf28f36f19a70a913ab4b60baa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0UZgiTZn6ZxJ6eHUhy1OGvI-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Higher Doses of Vitamin D May Boost Preemies' Bone Health", "title_full": "Higher Doses of Vitamin D May Boost Preemies' Bone Health", "published": "2017-10-19T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "826f49a766af6fbf28f36f19a70a913ab4b60baa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0UZgiTZn6ZxJ6eHUhy1OGvI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T00:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Higher Doses of Vitamin D May Boost Preemies' Bone Health", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169165.html Higher Doses of Vitamin D May Boost Preemies' Bone Health Doubling amount given also improved their growth   01/16/2018) By Mary Elizabeth Dallas Wednesday, October 18, 2017 \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 18,   Higher doses of vitamin D can improve the bone health of premature babies, new research suggests. \n\"We are hopeful that neonatologists will consider giving preterm infants 800 IUs [International Units],\" said study author Dr. Ann Anderson Berry. She is medical director of the NICU Nebraska Medicine, the clinical partner of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. \n\"We know that even with standard vitamin D dosing, we were still seeing a fair number of preterm infants who suffered from impaired bone health. This is another form of NICU [neonatal intensive care] therapy that can help decrease that risk,\" she said in a Nebraska news release. \nPremature and preterm infants are already routinely given vitamin D to help prevent weak bones and other conditions related to vitamin D deficiency, such as rickets. Dosages vary, however, and many infants still develop bone-related health issues. \nTo see if there is an optimal dose for protecting bone health, scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center looked at changes in vitamin D in the blood of 32 premature babies over the course of four weeks. The babies, who were born at between 24 and 32 weeks of pregnancy, were given either 400 or 800 IU/day of vitamin D. \nAfter four weeks, the babies' bone density improved and they had greater levels of vitamin D in their blood. Their growth also improved, the study found. \nThe study authors said they also found that doubling the typical dose of Vitamin D from 400 to 800 IUs could reduce the number of premature infants with extremely low bone density. \nThe findings were published recently in the journal PLOS ONE . \nSOURCE: University of Nebraska Medical Center, news release, Oct. 11, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bone hea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary elizabeth dallas wednesday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ann anderson berry", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vitamin d may boost preemies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of nebraska medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plos one", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicu nebraska medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T00:37:59.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e64f5dc32769ed75834c3eceb79fe2beb94f1f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0XjA40849PHO8nIrnlHXSzM-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Firefighters Exposed to Carcinogens Through the Skin", "title_full": "Firefighters Exposed to Carcinogens Through the Skin", "published": "2017-10-18T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e64f5dc32769ed75834c3eceb79fe2beb94f1f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0XjA40849PHO8nIrnlHXSzM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-18T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Firefighters Exposed to Carcinogens Through the Skin", "text": "URL of this page: https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169171.html Firefighters Exposed to Carcinogens Through the Skin Immediate decontamination might help reduce harms of contact with hazardous chemicals, study suggests (*this news item will not be available after 01/16/2018) By Robert Preidt Wednesday, October 18, 2017 \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 18, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Firefighters face many known hazards on the job, but one area that hasn't been well researched is how their skin's exposure to hazardous chemicals might increase their risk of cancer. \nIt has long been known that firefighters have higher rates of several types of cancer than people in the general population. \nIn a new study, researchers at the University of Ottawa examined firefighters' exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in smoke from fires. PAHs can cause genetic mutations and are known carcinogens. They are one of the hazardous substances released into the air when wood, plastics, furniture, electronics or building materials burn. \nThe researchers collected urine samples from -- and also wiped the skin and clothing of -- more than two dozen Canadian firefighters before and after they responded to fires in 2015 and 2016. \nOn average, the levels of PAH metabolites in urine were about three to five times higher after a fire than before a fire, the findings showed. That increase was associated with an average 4.3 times higher risk of DNA mutations. \n\"There's a relationship between firefighters' urinary PAH metabolite levels and the levels of PAHs on their skin, which leads us to suspect that [skin] contact may be an important route of exposure,\" Jennifer Keir, an author on the study, said in a news release from the American Chemical Society. \nThe researchers suggested that skin decontamination immediately after fighting a fire may help reduce exposure to these potentially cancer-causing compounds. \nThe study was published Oct. 18 in the journal Environmental Science & Technology . \nSOURCE: American Chemical Society, news release, Oct. 18, 2017 HealthDay Copyright (c) 2017 HealthDay .

He is a senior research fellow at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. \nJun cautioned, however, that the Canadian-Australian study was an observational one, so the possibility that results were due to other unmeasured factors cannot be excluded. \nThe standard anti-clotting drug is warfarin. Although the drug is effective, it has to be closely monitored with frequent blood tests to ensure it provides protection without the risk of major bleeding. \nNewer anticoagulants, called direct oral anticoagulants, are as effective as warfarin and don't require constant blood tests. But whether they increase the risk for major bleeding has not been clear from clinical practice. That's important because only Pradaxa has an antidote that can stop bleeding should it occur. \nAccording to Dr. Byron Lee, \"The direct oral anticoagulants have been getting a lot of bad press.\" Lee is director of electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at the University of California, San Francisco. \n\"Late-night TV commercials about class-action lawsuits scare patients into believing these new drugs are dangerous,\" he said. \nThe reality, Lee added, is that studies have shown that these new drugs are just as safe as warfarin, if not better. \n\"Some of these drugs do not yet have a reversal agent, yet this study showed that in a real-world setting, these drugs are not leading to more major bleeds or deaths,\" Lee said. \nThe one downside to these drugs is that they are often more expensive than warfarin, with higher co-pays, depending on the insurance plan. \nTo see how these drugs performed, Jun and his colleagues identified nearly 60,000 patients in the United States and Canada who had been diagnosed with VTE and were prescribed warfarin or one of the newer drugs between January 2009 and March 2016. \nOver an average of 85 days of follow-up, slightly more than 3 percent of the patients had an episode of major bleeding and nearly 2 percent died. \nThe risk of major bleeding was similar for both the newer anticoagulants and warfarin, the researchers found. And there was no difference in the risk of death, Jun said. \nThese findings didn't change when patients were followed for up to six months, he added. \nHowever, Jun noted, \"Further studies are needed to better understand the longer-term safety of these drugs among VTE patients as well as their safety among advanced chronic kidney disease patients, in whom the risk of major bleeding is greater compared with other patient groups.\" \nThe report was published online Oct. 17 in BMJ . \nSOURCES: Min Jun, Ph.D., senior research fellow, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Byron Lee, M.D., professor, medicine, and director, electrophysiology laboratories and clinics, University of California, San Francisco; Oct. 17, 2017, BMJ , online  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "byron lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of new south wales", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pradaxa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eliquis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xarelto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmj", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T00:38:13.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba35a2a9645e07f38c185a4550f7a03c15fdd5eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0WSypmL83.9ZnaDmGXSP.4Q-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/news_en.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "MedlinePlus Health News", "title": "Arthritis Can Strike Children", "title_full": "Arthritis Can Strike Children", "published": "2017-10-18T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba35a2a9645e07f38c185a4550f7a03c15fdd5eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0WSypmL83.9ZnaDmGXSP.4Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-18T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Arthritis Can Strike Children", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169134.html Arthritis Can Strike Children In these young patients, joint inflammation caused by overactive immune system   01/16/2018) By Robert Preidt Wednesday, October 18, 2017 \nTUESDAY, Oct. 17,   While arthritis is typically thought of as an older person's disease, more than 300,000 American children have chronic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), an expert says. \nUnlike age-related arthritis caused by cartilage and bone wear and tear, JIA has more to do with joint inflammation, but it's not clear what triggers this inflammation, said Dr. Barbara Ostrov, a pediatric and adult rheumatologist at Penn State Health in Hershey, Pa. \nSymptoms of JIA include joints that are consistently swollen, stiff or inflamed. In some cases, the disease also affects the eyes and can threaten vision if not diagnosed and treated promptly. All children with JIA should be monitored by an ophthalmologist. \nThe youngest children with JIA often don't complain about their pain. Signs that they may have JIA include wanting to be carried for the first couple of hours a day due to morning stiffness, or a persistently swollen knee or limp. \n\"In many cases, children just work around the problem and do function with minor adjustments in how they use the affected joints. But the older kids tend to perceive their arthritis differently and may have more discomfort,\" Ostrov said in a university news release. \nFor children with JIA who have inflammation in one or two joints, cortisone shots may offer relief for up to two years. Also, low doses of the medication methotrexate can help ease symptoms and inflammation in many patients. \nIf inflammation persists, doctors may prescribe biologic drugs to dampen an overactive immune response. \n\"We are fortunate to have medications to control this inflammation. Children tend to do well on them, with fewer side effects than adults,\" Ostrov said. \nThe outlook for children with JIA is much better now than it was decades ago, she added. \n\"In the 1980s and 90s we had kids who needed hips, knees and other joints replaced with new joints.

As a result, you could buy drugs that are unsafe or ineffective for your pet. \nWhen ordering pet medications online be sure you're dealing with a reputable pharmacy. \nOne way to do that is to look for pharmacy websites ending in \".Pharmacy,\" said Dr. Martine Hartogensis, deputy director of the Office of Surveillance and Compliance in the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. \nOr order your pet medications from an outsourced prescription management service that's used by your veterinarian. These state-licensed internet pharmacy services work directly with the veterinarian. These pharmacies also require a prescription be written by the veterinarian. Check if your veterinarian uses an internet pharmacy service. \nIt's also important to first consult your veterinarian. An online pharmacy may claim that one of its veterinarians will assess your pet based on written information you provide, with no need for a physical examination. But that could be a warning sign that the pharmacy is not legitimate. \nGoing online to buy two types of widely used veterinary drugs -- heartworm preventives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- can be especially risky. \n\"Both types of drugs can be dangerous if your vet doesn't get involved,\" Hartogensis said in an FDA news release. \n\"It's not generally a concern if you use a legitimate online pharmacy and mail in a prescription from your veterinarian, who is monitoring your pet. But if there is no veterinarian-client-patient relationship, it's a dangerous practice,\" she warned. \nSOURCE: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, news release, Oct. 11, 2017  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hartogensis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert preidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martine hartogensis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for veterinary medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of surveillance and compliance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T00:38:23.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8e6f97a2070934e557207f57788aab2c508daf5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0VkSZu8GJdugUW5W5EjrRKg-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://pcomsociety.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "PCOM Society", "title": "1 in 5 Young Women Who Tan Indoors Get Addicted", "title_full": "1 in 5 Young Women Who Tan Indoors Get Addicted", "published": "2017-10-19T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8e6f97a2070934e557207f57788aab2c508daf5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0VkSZu8GJdugUW5W5EjrRKg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Women's Health New Links: MedlinePlus RSS Feed", "published": "2017-10-19T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "1 in 5 Young Women Who Tan Indoors Get Addicted", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169194.html 1 in 5 Young Women Who Tan Indoors Get Addicted Depression and worries about appearance common in those who can't skip the tanning bed, study finds     \nTHURSDAY, Oct. 19,   More than 20 percent of young white women who've been to a tanning salon become addicted to tanning -- even though doing so raises their risk of deadly skin cancer and premature skin aging, a new study reports. \nThese women seem to depend on tanning to feel attractive and often show symptoms of depression, the researchers said. \n\"Indoor tanning remains a public health concern for skin cancer prevention,\" said lead researcher Darren Mays, an assistant professor of oncology at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. \n\"Our study indicates a substantial proportion of young women who indoor tan may become dependent, putting this group at especially high risk for skin cancer later in life,\" he said. \nIndoor tanning is dangerous. It increases the risk of melanoma, the most deadly cancer, by 20 percent and increases the risk of other skin cancers as well, Mays said. \nThe researchers found that as beliefs about the importance of appearance grew stronger, young women were 73 percent more likely to be addicted to indoor tanning. \nIn addition, women who were depressed were nearly four times more likely to have a tanning addiction, compared with women who weren't depressed, Mays said. \nIt's not yet clear why some women become addicted to tanning. Some scientists believe that tanning produces a by-product that has an opioid drug-like effect on some people. \nJoseph Levy is scientific adviser to the American Suntanning Association, which represents the tanning salon industry. He disagreed that tanning can be addictive. \n\"It is imprudent to characterize our natural and intended attraction to sunlight as addictive,\" he said. \"Ultraviolet exposure is a natural attraction, and humans get less regular sunlight today than at any point in human history.\" \nAt least one medical specialist disagreed with Levy. Dr. Doris Day, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said she sees women who are addicted to tanning every day. \n\"Tanning is not safe and it's not healthy,\" she said. Day tells women who are addicted to tanning about the risk for skin cancer and premature skin aging. \nIn addition, she helps them reduce their need to tan and gradually reduce the amount they tan. \nDay advises using sunscreen, and if you absolutely need to have that suntanned look, to use a bronzer instead. \n\"I tell them to perfect their pale or go with their own glow,\" she said. \nMays and his colleagues studied tanning addiction among nearly 400 white women between 18 and 30 years old. White women were chosen for the study because they're the ones most likely to use indoor tanning. \nThe participants completed online questionnaires and had used an indoor tanning device one or more times in the past year. Nearly 47 percent of the women were college students. \nThe researchers measured tanning dependence based on two questionnaires. The participants were considered tanning-dependent if they tested positive for addictive behavior on both questionnaires. \nIn total, nearly 23 percent of the women tested positive for indoor tanning dependence, the researchers found. \nWomen who were dependent were more likely to have begun tanning at an earlier age, to be concerned about their appearance and to have depressive symptoms, compared with women who weren't dependent, Mays said. \nHe said women need to understand not only the risks of tanning but to be on the lookout for signs of tanning addiction, such as symptoms of depression. \nHowever, getting people to change this behavior may be tough, he added. \n\"We do not yet have resources available to help young women who may be tanning-dependent to change their behavior to reduce their risk,\" Mays said. \nThe report was published Oct. 19 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention . \nSOURCES: Darren Mays, Ph.D., M.P.H., assistant professor, oncology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D.C.; Doris Day, M.D., dermatologist, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York City; Joseph Levy, scientific advisor, American Suntanning Association; Oct. 19, 2017, Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention HealthDay Copyright   More Health News on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-21T03:04:22.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "11ab2f08c3d8836b321559bc51a0bab50dbd9b55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0SUbpXlL5IQXLQ67JN6.2wk-", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://pcomsociety.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "PCOM Society", "title": "Could Too Much Exercise Be Bad for Men\u2019s Hearts?", "title_full": "Could Too Much Exercise Be Bad for Men\u2019s Hearts?", "published": "2017-10-19T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/images/share_news_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11ab2f08c3d8836b321559bc51a0bab50dbd9b55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfWc1ABzWfyNL2q8bsPHoZ0SUbpXlL5IQXLQ67JN6.2wk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Exercise and Physical Fitness New Links: MedlinePlus RSS Feed", "published": "2017-10-19T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Could Too Much Exercise Be Bad for Men\u2019s Hearts?", "text": " //medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169189.html Could Too Much Exercise Be Bad for Men's Hearts? Maybe, but only for white men, study suggests     \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 18,   When it comes to exercise, can you get too much of a good thing? \nPossibly, suggests a new study that found white men who exercise more than seven hours a week have an 86 percent higher risk of developing plaque build-up in their arteries. No such elevated risk was seen among either black men or women. \nPlaque build-up is a critical warning sign for possible future heart disease risk. \n\"We were surprised by the finding, mainly because we essentially think of exercise as medicine. And we've never thought of exercise as perhaps having an upper limit in terms of its cardiovascular benefit,\" said study author Deepika Laddu. \nShe's an assistant professor of physical therapy at the College of Applied Health Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \nBut Laddu doesn't want any men to hang up their running shoes just yet, because there are many questions that remain to be answered. \n\"What we saw is only an association, and we cannot say that high physical activity actually causes plaque build-up in white men,\" she noted. \n\"And we certainly do not mean to say that exercise is bad for you. In fact, it could perhaps be that white men already face a higher than average risk for plaque build-up than other men, and that exercise actually prevents this plaque from rupturing, which is when things get bad. We just don't know,\" Laddu explained. \"Much more research will be needed to understand what is really going on.\" \nAt least one other expert agreed this doesn't mean people should stop exercising. \nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the findings do not instantly wash away the \"balance of data [that] suggest that higher levels of leisure time and total physical activity are associated with lower risk cardiovascular events.\" \n\"However, it should be recognized that exercise alone cannot overcome other cardiovascular risk factors,\" he added. \"And it is vital to maintain health levels of blood pressure, cholesterol and body weight, as well as not smoke, even if one is engaging in regular rigorous physical activity.\" \nTo explore how exercise might impact heart health over time, the investigators recruited nearly 3,200 white and black men and women. All enrolled when they were between the ages of 18 and 30, and all resided in one of four cities: Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis or Oakland. \nThe researchers followed the study volunteers from 1985 to 2011. During that time, participants self-reported their physical activity routines and showed up for at least three follow-up exams, which included CT scans to measure plaque build-up. \nCurrent U.S. physical activity guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly. Participants were sorted into three groups, depending on average exercise levels. One group exercised below the guidelines level. Another group met the guidelines, and a final group exercised three times more than the guideline level. \n\"We had 25 years of exercise patterns that we could look at, in individuals who started out as being young adults up through middle-age,\" Laddu said. \nIn the end, the study team found that overall -- when pooling race and gender -- those who were among the most frequent exercisers were 27 percent more likely to develop plaque build-up by the time they had reached middle age. \nBut after breaking the numbers down further, the authors determined that only high-exercising white men faced a greater risk for developing plaque build-up then their low-exercising peers. \n\"But again, we can't say physical activity is causing plaque build-up,\" Laddu reiterated. \nShe also acknowledged the study had limitations. For one, she noted that very few of the high exercisers were black, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. \n\"And we really have no idea yet what may be biologically at play that might lead to differences in the way exercise affects [plaque build-up] in some people and not others,\" Laddu added. \n\"But what I can say is that maybe this study indicates that doctors should not assume that their patients are healthy simply because they check off the exercise box,\" she said. \"Maybe there are other things that they need to look at when considering a patient's overall medical profile.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 16 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings . \nSOURCES: Deepika Laddu, Ph.D., assistant professor, physical therapy, College of Applied Health Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago; Gregg Fonarow, M.D, professor, cardiology, University of California, Los Angeles; October 16, 2017, Mayo Clinic Proceedings HealthDay Copyright   More Health News on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-21T03:04:26.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05b17d1417b4a4a7e75d69b8a9c3c0d2845ed05a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfYXU2eu1MrUQ7BhPMpBE3pHbYMWnU2AE0G5tB0_zc_9Cmkk7PJXSK4xS8i2IuqX0q", "site_full": "medlineplus.gov", "site": "medlineplus.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/feeds/topics/celiacdisease.xml", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "Celiac Disease New Links: MedlinePlus RSS Feed", "title": "Exploring the Celiac Disease Mystery", "title_full": "Exploring the Celiac Disease Mystery", "published": "2017-10-17T18:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://medlineplus.gov/magazine/issues/fall17/articles/images/murray-dr-nih-copd.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05b17d1417b4a4a7e75d69b8a9c3c0d2845ed05a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1p9XFcQWvhWO94lmisYDfYXU2eu1MrUQ7BhPMpBE3pHbYMWnU2AE0G5tB0_zc_9Cmkk7PJXSK4xS8i2IuqX0q", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-17T18:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Exploring the Celiac Disease Mystery", "text": "Exploring the Celiac Disease Mystery Follow us Exploring the Celiac Disease Mystery Research looks at what\u2019s causing the rise of this autoimmune disorder Photo: Mayo Clinic \nMOST OF US KNOW SOMEONE on a gluten-free diet. But not all of us know someone who has no choice but to be on one. This is the case for those with celiac disease. It causes the immune system to attack a person\u2019s small intestine if they eat gluten. \n\u201cPatients who have celiac disease must avoid all gluten,\u201d said Joseph Murray, M.D. \u201cIt\u2019s not a choice. It\u2019s a matter of medical need.\u201d Dr. Murray is an internist and gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He receives funding support from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. \nA person with celiac disease who does not eat an entirely gluten-free diet could experience many medical issues, including abdominal pain, rashes, and even death. Choice vs. celiac disease \nDr. Murray said there are pros and cons to the rise in popularity of a gluten-free diet for celiac disease patients. \nOn the positive side, patients tend to have more gluten-free options at restaurants and in grocery stores. They also don\u2019t feel as strange about living gluten-free since it\u2019s no longer rare. \nHowever, it\u2019s also caused some people to take gluten-free diets less seriously. \n\u201cThe biggest problem is the fashion of the gluten-free diet, because you might lose weight, for example,\u201d Dr. Murray said. \u201cIn that fashion or fad is loss of the real disease of celiac disease, which is a serious illness that causes damage in the intestines.\u201d \nOne industry that can be particularly problematic is the food service industry. \u201cThey feel that they have been barraged with demands for lots of diets, many of which are not medically justified or necessary,\u201d Dr. Murray explained. \u201cAnd one of those is a gluten-free diet. When they\u2019re faced with a patient with celiac disease, they don\u2019t often recognize that that patient is facing a real medical need.\u201d \nThe problems with the rise of gluten-free by choice don\u2019t end with those with celiac disease either. \nDr. Murray warned that many people who eat an unnecessarily gluten-free diet are missing out on important nutrients like fiber and whole grains. Additionally, they may be consuming unnecessary calories and significantly more added sugar when eating prepackaged, gluten-free foods. Solving celiac mysteries \n\u201cLiving gluten-free in our world is difficult,\u201d Dr. Murray explained, which is why studies about celiac disease are so important. Dr. Murray is working to answer some critical questions about celiac disease. Who gets it? Why do they get it? Why has celiac disease become more common in our country and around the world? \nHis work studying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and its data are starting to answer some of those questions. \nFor example, they have found that one in 141 Americans has celiac disease. Celiac disease is also more common in northern states in the U.S. and occurs more often in Caucasians. \nDr. Murray also learned that a significant number of people who have celiac disease have not been diagnosed. However, the number of diagnoses has gone up in recent years. \n\u201cThe efforts that have been made to increase medical awareness and testing for celiac disease are working,\u201d he said. \nHe is also working on a study focused on refractory celiac disease, which is when the small intestine continues to be damaged despite the individual going on a gluten-free diet. \n\u201cThat\u2019s at the very sharp point of the worst of celiac disease and consequences,\u201d Dr. Murray said.

If a person with celiac disease eats food with gluten, a protein found naturally in wheat, barley, and rye, his or her body creates an immune response that attacks the small intestine. Celiac disease can cause long-term medical problems, such as malnutrition or osteoporosis. \nSome adults with celiac disease have digestive problems such as intestinal discomfort or pain after consuming gluten, but they are more likely to have headaches, depression or anxiety, and other symptoms. Some people feel tired, have sore joints, or even get a rash. This skin rash, called dermatitis herpetiformis, causes itchy bumps and blisters. \nDigestive symptoms are more common in children and can include bloating, chronic diarrhea, constipation, gas, nausea, fatty stools that float, stomach pain, and vomiting. \nTo treat celiac disease, a provider must first diagnose it. Diagnosis can often be difficult, as celiac disease symptoms are often similar to those of other conditions. Diagnosing celiac disease often begins with a review of family history and a physical exam. If your provider suspects you have dermatitis herpetiformis, a blood test and intestinal or skin biopsy is needed to diagnose celiac disease. If these tests do not clearly confirm celiac disease, a genetic test can help rule it out. \nIf you have celiac disease, you must follow a strict gluten-free diet. This can include more than you would expect. You should avoid all foods that contain gluten, such as most cereal, grains, and pasta, and many processed foods. You can eat gluten-free bread, pasta, and other foods that are now easier to find in stores, restaurants, and at special food companies. You also can eat potato, rice, soy, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or bean flour instead of wheat flour. \nYou also must consider the products you use. For example, if a lip balm contains gluten, you are at risk of consuming it. Some soaps or lotions also contain gluten, which could transfer from your hands to your mouth. \nA gluten-free diet is the only treatment for celiac disease that has been approved and is safe and effective. SOURCE: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Celiac Disease or Gluten Sensitivity? \nSome of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity (also known as gluten intolerance) are similar to those of celiac disease. They include feeling tired and stomachaches. It can cause other symptoms including muscle cramps and leg numbness. But gluten sensitivity does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease. \nResearchers are still learning more about gluten sensitivity. If your provider thinks you have it, he or she may suggest that you stop eating gluten to see if your symptoms go away. However, you should first be tested to rule out celiac disease.

It was a complete mystery to her and her family. \nAfter six months, she finally knew what was wrong. A skin biopsy revealed she had dermatitis herpetiformis, which then led to the diagnosis of celiac disease. \nShe and her mom had to make a number of changes. Their work started in the kitchen. They got rid of all foods containing gluten in their house. They also threw away food that had come into contact with gluten-containing foods. \nThen Rose had to go through her beauty products and toss any soap, shampoo, or other products that contained gluten. Since those products could come in contact with her mouth, they could cause accidental gluten exposure. \n\u201cThe idea was to eliminate everything that you could from things that you could touch, so that you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d she said. \nLiving at home, she had control. College was going to be different. As a student at Iowa State University, Rose had to learn about the school\u2019s resources for students living gluten-free. She adapted to her new lifestyle. Jack\u2019s story \nFor some people, college is the best time of life. It wasn\u2019t for Jack Gottschalk. He felt too sick to enjoy himself. \n\u201cI felt sick all the time. I couldn\u2019t eat anything and feel good afterwards,\u201d said Jack. \nAs a swimmer at York College in Pennsylvania, Jack often had pasta parties with his teammates. He never guessed that the delicious pasta was causing him trouble. \nThe summer before his senior year, Jack was diagnosed with celiac disease. It turns out that most pasta is primarily made with gluten. \nHe was surprised to learn that there was only one treatment: Jack had to follow a strict gluten-free diet. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really anything you can do for this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to live differently and that\u2019s kind of a shock.\u201d Rose and Jack\u2019s story \nRose and Jack met in 2015. She was attending grad school in Maryland, where he lived. \nIn addition to their Maryland residency, it turns out they had one more thing in common. They both have celiac disease. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge advantage to have a partner with the same dietary restrictions,\u201d Rose said. \u201cKnowing that you have somebody who is going through something similar and understands how serious it is, you\u2019re not going to get questions all the time like, \u2018Is that really necessary? Do you have to do that?\u2019\u201d \nJack says it makes things easy to have an entirely gluten-free home. Both he and Rose say they never have to worry about grabbing something out of the pantry to snack on. \n\u201cI can live a totally normal life within the confines of our home,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt fades into the background and you don\u2019t even remember it half the time when you\u2019re at home because it\u2019s not something you have to worry about actively.\u201d \nThe two have found, as so many with celiac disease have, both benefits and frustrations with the rise in people choosing a gluten-free lifestyle. \u201cThe awareness of celiac disease and gluten-free diets has been both a blessing and a curse,\u201d Rose said. \nSince they were diagnosed, there are many more foods they can eat. They are both happy with the expanded gluten-free offerings and accommodations they\u2019ve found, but food labels can still be challenging. \nRose explained that often they will find a product labeled gluten-free, only to turn the package over and read that it was made in a facility that processes wheat. \n\u201cIt does lead to a lot more accidental exposures,\u201d Rose said. \u201cPeople will try something new thinking that it will be okay and it isn\u2019t.\u201d \nOver time, Rose and Jack have become used to their gluten-free lives. They hope others faced with the same diagnosis will not be too worried about the adjustment. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as you think it is,\u201d Rose said. \nJack recommends that those who are newly diagnosed take time to explore new food options and be prepared for things like social gatherings. He says you should still go to parties and get togethers\u2014just bring your own food. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really not a big deal, especially compared to the peace of mind you\u2019ll have knowing your food is safe,\u201d Jack said. \nRose and Jack enjoy busy lives. Rose is a medical and scientific illustrator and Jack is a retail professional. \nDealing with celiac disease is just one aspect of their lives. Tips for Following a Gluten-Free Diet \nEating a gluten-free diet can be overwhelming for newly diagnosed celiac patients. We\u2019ve combined some fun gluten-free eating tips from Rose Perry and Jack Gottschalk, as well as helpful advice from Joseph Murray, M.D., a gastroenterologist and internist. \nIsolate New Foods When you try new foods, do it with one food at a time. This way, if you have a negative reaction, you can pinpoint what food caused it. \nCheck Labels Be sure to check food and product labels thoroughly. A food or product may be labeled \u201cgluten-free\u201d but be sure to read the ingredient list, and look for any warnings about how and where the product was produced. \nTry Different Brands Explore different brands. There are many gluten-free offerings today, and you won\u2019t know what you like until you try it. \nExplore Cooking at Home Put on an apron and try some new recipes at home. It can be easier to avoid cross-contamination at home since you have more control over the environment. \nAsk Questions Stay aware when eating at restaurants, friends\u2019 houses, or unfamiliar environments. If someone has made food you\u2019re unsure of, ask what ingredients were used and what kind of environment it was made in. \nKeep Nutritious Be sure to check for other nutritional information. Often, gluten-free foods can be high in sugar and other fats, and lack important nutrients like fiber.

DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by Poison Control or a health care professional. \nIf the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes. \nIf the chemical was swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk, unless instructed otherwise by a health care provider. DO NOT give water or milk if the person is having symptoms (such as vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow. \nIf the person breathed in the poison, immediately move him or her to fresh air. Before Calling Emergency The person's age, weight, and condition The name of the product (ingredients and strengths, if known) The time it was swallowed The amount swallowed \nHowever, DO NOT delay calling for help if this information is not immediately available. Poison Control \nYour local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions. \nThis is a free and confidential service. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What to Expect at the Emergency Room \nThe person will be admitted to a hospital. The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. \nThe person may receive: Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and breathing machine (ventilator) Blood and urine tests Camera down the throat (endoscopy) to see burns in the esophagus and stomach Chest x-ray EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing) Fluids through a vein (IV) Medicines to treat symptoms \nNote: Activated charcoal does not effectively treat (adsorb) sodium hypochlorite. \nFor skin exposure, treatment may include: Irrigation (washing of the skin), possibly every few hours for several days Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement) Transfer to a hospital that specializes in burn care \nThe person may need to be admitted to a hospital to continue treatment. Surgery may be needed if the esophagus, stomach, or intestine have holes (perforations) from the acid. Outlook (Prognosis) \nSwallowing, smelling, or touching household bleach will likely not cause any significant problems. However, more severe problems can occur with industrial-strength bleach, or from mixing bleach with ammonia. \nHow well a person does depends on how rapidly the sodium hypochlorite was diluted and neutralized. There is a good chance of recovery if proper treatment is given soon after the poison was swallowed. Without prompt treatment, extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible, depending on how exposure occurred. Holes (perforation) in the esophagus and stomach may cause serious infections in both the chest and abdominal cavities, which may result in death.
