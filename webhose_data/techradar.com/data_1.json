As we heard back in the summer, esports is still being considered for inclusion in the Olympic Games in France (Paris) come 2024. \nAll that said, when the fans were asked whether esports would become a \u2018mainstream activity\u2019 in the near future, the majority (71%) believed it would. That\u2019s hardly surprising given the recent spread of esports TV coverage, which in the UK has come to Sky , and of late BBC Three (online) and BT Sports . Diverse followers \nThe study (spotted by VentureBeat ) also found that a typical esports fan follows no less than 5.7 games on average, spread across 2.6 genres \u2013 in other words they\u2019ve got a pretty wide sphere of interest, and aren\u2019t fanatically focused on just one game. \nSo what\u2019s the most popular esports game on the PC? In the US, the most-watched title is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (unsurprisingly), followed by League of Legends, Dota 2, StarCraft, and Heroes of the Storm (all of the latter are MOBAs save for Blizzard\u2019s veteran RTS). \nAlthough when it comes to actually playing games, the most popular title is Call of Duty which 61% of US respondents said they played. In the UK, the top game was Grand Theft Auto, played by 63% of those questioned. \nAs for demographics, 70% of esports fans are male and aged between 13 and 40. 66% of those surveyed said they watched livestreams of esports live (as opposed to later, or the highlights), but only 37% attended actual esports events in person. \nNielsen also looked at the prospects of virtual reality esports, saying that it \u2018could\u2019 eventually arrive as a force \u2013 although only 5% of esports fans own a VR headset currently. That said, 37% of respondents said they plan to buy a VR device within the next year. \nIntel is certainly trying to give virtual reality esports a big push with its VR Challenger League , featuring dueling mages and a futuristic Tron-like zero-gravity team sport.

But there's hope. \nWe've tested and sorted through the latest Android tablets in order to come up with a top 10 list, all ranked below. Our recommendations are a combination of performance for your dollar, design, features, build quality and value. \nThis comprehensive Android tablet list will be updated frequently throughout 2017, as Samsung, Google and many other companies continue to release new tablets and upgrade the software with Android Nougat and Android O . \nHere are the best tablets that you can buy this year. 1. Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 \nThe world's first HDR-ready tablet \nWeight: 429g | Dimensions: 237 x 169 x 6mm | OS: Android 7 Nougat | Screen size: 9.7 inches | Resolution: 2,048 x 1,536 | CPU: Snapdragon 820 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB | microSD slot: Yes | Battery: 6,000 mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP Samsung's best design yet Keyboard a costly extra Can't replace a laptop \nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 is easily the best Android tablet to date, headlined by an HDR-ready display, four powerful speakers and an upgraded S Pen that's included inside the box. The keyboard folio is a worthwhile extra. \nIt shocks us to say this, but it's actually a bit too future-proofed in some ways. Its HDR screen looks great, but the trove of promised content from Netflix and Amazon isn't here yet \u2013 at least not on tablets. But that shouldn't stop you from considering Samsung's latest and greatest if what you're after is a top-tier Android tablet. \nRead the full review: Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 2. Asus ZenPad 3S 10 \nAndroid's iPad killer \nWeight: 430g | Dimensions: 240 x 164 x 5.5mm | OS: Android 6 Marshmallow | Screen size: 9.7 inches | Resolution: 2,048 x 1,536 | CPU: Mediatek MT8176 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/64GB | microSD slot: Yes | Battery: 10 hours | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 5MP Brilliant 2K display Some build quality issues So-so battery life \nThe Asus ZenPad 3S 10 might look like an iPad in design, but given its roots in Android, it's obviously a much different beast. \nFor your money, it's a hard ask to find another Android tablet that puts classy design at the forefront like the ZenPad 3S 10. Paired with its gorgeous 2K display and strong audio performance, it makes quite the impression from a multimedia perspective. \nOur review points out that there are a few low points in the presentation, like the average battery life, but issues aside, the amount of features and performance level you get here is well worth the low asking price. \nRead the full review: Asus ZenPad 3S 10 3. Google Pixel C \nGoogle's own tablet is excellent \nWeight: 517g | Dimensions: 242 x 179 x 7mm | OS: Android 7 Nougat | Screen size: 10.2 inches | Resolution: 2,560 x 1,800 | CPU: Nvidia Tegra X1, quad-core | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32GB | microSD slot: No | Battery: 10 hours | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 2MP Fantastic screen Accessories are costly Somewhat heavy \nGoogle's first foray into crafting its very own tablets started couldn't have gone much better. While it was once the best Android tablet out there, the Pixel C is still recommended for a few reasons. \nIts design borrows from the gorgeous Chromebook Pixel, then builds upon it with versatility to allow easy switching between a standalone tablet or a laptop. Android power-users will also appreciate that it runs stock OS and thus, like Nexus and Pixel products, the Pixel C is now running the latest software, Android Nougat , with support for Android O coming soon. \nThe Pixel C certainly isn't cheap, but you won't find another Android tablet packed with this slick combination of power, style and the latest software updates. \nRead the full review: Google Pixel C 4. Lenovo Yoga Tab 3 Pro \nA tablet that balances novelty and performance well \nWeight: 667g | Dimensions: 246 x 179 x 4.6mm | OS: Android 6 Marshmallow | Screen size: 10.1 inches | Resolution: 2,560 x 1,600 | CPU: Intel Atom x 5-Z8500, quad-core | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 32GB | microSD slot: Yes | Battery: 10,200mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP Integrated projector Expensive Heavy \nMost tablets are very similar to one another, but not the Lenovo Yoga Tab 3 Pro. It sits in its own sub-category of Android tablets that try and succeed at being weird, yet awesome. \nThis tablet has all of the usual amenities that one desires in a 2017 tablet, including some extras, such as 2,560 x 1600 display and a huge 10,200mAh battery. But this tablet also houses a hidden projector that can splash the screen onto a wall for night-time viewing. Cool, right? It's novel and useful. \nRead the full review: Lenovo Yoga Tab 3 Pro 5. Amazon Fire HD 8 (2017) \nThe best you can get at this price \nWeight: 369g | Dimensions: 214mm x 128mm x 9.7mm | OS: Fire OS | Screen size: 8-inch | Resolution: 1280 x 800 | CPU: Quad-core 1.3GHz | RAM: 1.5GB | Storage: 16/32GB | Battery: Up to 12 hours | Rear camera: 2MP | Front camera: VGA Good battery life Reflective screen A little slow in places \nThe Amazon Fire HD 8 (2017) is among the best of the retail giant\u2019s tablets, as while it\u2019s in many ways lower end than the similar HD 10, the smaller screen is sharper as a result, and the price is lower. \nIt also delivers surprisingly strong gaming performance, with a decent amount of power for the money. The speakers aren\u2019t great and the cameras are awful, but tablets aren\u2019t for taking photos and you can always use headphones. \nWhat you do get is solid if not spectacular performance, and tight integration with Amazon\u2019s other services through Fire OS, all at a price that\u2019s well below most of the non-Amazon branded competition. You should also note that if you already own the 2016 version of this tablet, it won't be worth upgrading to the 2017 version as the differences are very minimal. \nRead the full review: 6. Amazon Fire HD 10 \nAn affordable way to enjoy Amazon's media \nWeight: 432g | Dimensions: 262mm x 159mm x 7.7mm | OS: Fire OS | Screen size: 10.1-inch | Resolution: 1280 x 800 | CPU: Quad-core 1.5GHz | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 16/32/64GB | Battery: Up to 8 hours | Rear camera: 5MP | Front camera: HD Low price Weak screen resolution Plasticky design \nThe Amazon Fire HD 10 is the company\u2019s flagship tablet, but to call it a flagship is misleading, as while it\u2019s top of the range it sports middling specs at best. But that\u2019s okay because it\u2019s very, very affordable. \nIts 10.1-inch 1280 x 800 screen doesn\u2019t provide a very sharp picture, but audio fares much better thanks to loud and clear stereo speakers, and with up to 64GB of built in storage plus a microSD card slot there\u2019s plenty of room for apps, games and other media. \nWhich is all good, because this being an Amazon product you\u2019re faced with things to buy, download, rent and stream at every turn. \nRead the full review: 7. Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 \nThis ultra-light Android tablet is now an even better deal \nWeight: 389g | Dimensions: 237 x 169 x 5.6mm | OS: Android 6 Marshmallow (Nougat incoming) | Screen size: 9.7 inches | Resolution: 2,048 x 1,536 | CPU: Exynos 7 5433, octa-core | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32GB | microSD slot: Yes | Battery: 5,870mAh | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 2.1MP Thinner, lighter design Small specs upgrade Bloatware \nSamsung is firing straight at the iPad's greatest weakness with the Galaxy Tab S2: storage capacity. The latest from the popular smartphone and tablet maker offers 32GB of internal storage as the standard out of the box, with support for up to 128GB via the microSD slot. \nIt also stands out amongst the greater tablet competition with a stellar 2,048 x 1,536 Super AMOLED display and Samsung's own zippy Exynos 7 5433 octa-core chipset, which consists of a 1.9GHz quad-core processor working in tandem with a 1.3GHz quad-core processor. \nGiven that the Tab S3 sits at the top of our list, the S2 still comes recommended given that it is now an even better deal. \nRead the full review: Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8. Amazon Fire 7 (2017) \nAlmost unbelievably cheap \nWeight: 295g | Dimensions: 115mm x 192mm x 9.6mm | OS: Fire OS | Screen size: 7-inch | Resolution: 1024 x 600 | CPU: Quad-core 1.3GHz | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 8/16GB | Battery: Up to 7 hours | Rear camera: 2MP | Front camera: VGA Crazily cheap price Screen is dull and low res Lacking Google Play app store \nTablets don\u2019t get any cheaper than this \u2013 well, functional ones don\u2019t anyway. The incredibly low price and sturdy design make the Amazon Fire a great choice to give to a kid \u2013 in fact, Amazon\u2019s even built a (pricier) version specifically for children. \nBut even for a grown audience the Amazon Fire far exceeds expectations, with a fairly bright 7.0-inch screen, acceptable speakers, solid battery life and even reasonable performance, with a snappy interface and the ability to run most games. \nFire OS won\u2019t suit everyone and this isn\u2019t a tablet that impresses once you take the price out of the equation, but for what the Amazon Fire costs it would almost be rude not to consider it. \nRead the full review: 9. Samsung Galaxy Tab S \nSamsung's last-gen tablet has a better screen than its latest \nWeight: 464g | Dimensions: 247 x 177 x 6.6mm | OS: Android 4.0 KitKat | Screen size: 10.5 inches | Resolution: 2,560 x 1,600 | CPU: Exynos 5, octa-core | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 16GB | microSD slot: Yes | Battery: 9.5 hours | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 2.1MP Excellent screen Small onboard storage Uninspiring bloatware \nThere's no shame in buying last-gen tech products. The best-case scenario sees you saving a bunch of cash, while still having access to fairly modern specifications. And with the Galaxy Tab S, that's exactly what you'll get, plus some. \nThe Galaxy Tab S3 is the latest and greatest in Samsung's line of tablets. But the Tab S is still a respectable purchase, packing in impressive specs like a Super AMOLED display pushing 2560 x 1600. \nRead the full review: Samsung Galaxy Tab S Related news", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon fire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "android o", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon fire hd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google pixel c   most", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenovo yoga tab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exynos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asus", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:16:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b46550578c3049a1f8944b24c0530c2faab8ea4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3v1KGVQ6XkMsDE4pfesW.iyZexqcg8bcQA8HCnt27Cw5i3aOW8WPoHOKU34F2cQqSANF0TCOsy0MLZtEFe6G6ZTvwqItGt1eT", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Fallout 4 VR code for free when purchasing an HTC Vive | TechRadar", "title_full": "Get Fallout 4 VR code for free when purchasing an HTC Vive | TechRadar", "published": "2017-10-03T12:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.278, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCs79P5pAevbF47MiggJEW-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 10, "comments": 0, "shares": 10}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b46550578c3049a1f8944b24c0530c2faab8ea4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3v1KGVQ6XkMsDE4pfesW.iyZexqcg8bcQA8HCnt27Cw5i3aOW8WPoHOKU34F2cQqSANF0TCOsy0MLZtEFe6G6ZTvwqItGt1eT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Abbas Jaffar Ali", "published": "2017-10-03T12:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Fallout 4 VR code for free when purchasing an HTC Vive | TechRadar", "text": "Get Fallout 4 VR code for free when purchasing an HTC Vive Get Fallout 4 VR code for free when purchasing an HTC Vive A radioactive sweetener for pricey Vive purchases. Shares \nDespite making you face the horrors of a nuclear holocaust head-on, fully immersed, Fallout 4 VR is one of the most hotly-anticipated virtual reality games on the way before the end of the year. And now, as an HTC Vive exclusive, it's just got even easier to get for VR newcomers. \nPurchase a new HTC Vive, and Bethesda's irradiated open-world RPG is yours through a redemption code free of charge \nWhile the HTC Vive package itself remains pricey even after a price drop (packing the headset, two controllers and two motion-tracking sensors in for AED 2,599), that does save you having to fork out for the game on top, which itself costs AED 239. Pip-ing Oculus to the post \nIt was quite the coup for the HTC Vive when Bethesda Softworks announced that Fallout 4 VR would exclusively come to its platform, eschewing the Oculus Rift (while PlayStation VR meanwhile gets the studios other big hit, Skyrim, converted into VR). Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax Media, has long been embroiled in a legal battle with Oculus over potential patent infringements, which is likely a contributing factor in Fallout 4 VR skipping the Facebook-owned hardware. \nFor those that pick up a new HTC Vive, Fallout 4 VR will be shipped as a download code upon its release on December 12. Existing Vive owners that pick up Fallout 4 VR independently will be treated to a three-month subscription to Viveport, the HTC Vive VR game subscription service. \nThe news follows the announcement of a hardware refresh from Sony, making minor quality of life improvements to its PlayStation VR headset .

The noise-cancellation certainly impresses, but what's more surprising is that B&W has built in an innovative sensing system that means the headphones turn off automatically when you're not wearing them. Unfortunately, their sound quality doesn't quite keep pace with their other innovations, leading to a pair of headphones that ultimately falls short of true greatness. For Sound lacks definition No classic B&W black leather \nWireless noise-cancelling headphones feel like the pinnacle of headphone technology. It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll find all the major brands really flexing their audio muscles. \nWhether it\u2019s Bose with the QC35 , Sony with the MDR-1000X , or Sennheiser with its Momentum Wireless , all the big players have a high tech pair of cans to sit at the top of their ranges. \nAll the big players, that is, except for Bowers and Wilkins. Although the speaker company has put out a number of excellent pairs of headphones in recent years, so far it hasn\u2019t put out any noise-cancelling headphones to compete with its competitors flagships. \nThe newly unveiled Bowers and Wilkins PX Wireless ($400 / \u00a3330) are hence an important pair of headphones for the company. This is the top end of its mainstream range, (with the P9 Signature as its most exclusive, premium pair), and it\u2019s where it gets to show off the best of its tech. \nIn these terms, the PX Wireless are a massive success. The headline feature, the noise-cancellation, works impressively well, and the headphones are also packed with a host of other features that we hope become industry standards such as sensing when they\u2019re off your head and disconnecting automatically. \nBut, fundamentally, this functionality appears to have lead to a compromise in B&W\u2019s usual premium sound, which means the PX Wireless aren\u2019t quite as good sounding as the competition at this price point. Design \nIt\u2019s not just internally that the PX Wireless are different from what the company has done before \u2013 the entire design language of the headphones is completely different. \nGone is the black leather and silver accenting that has become the company\u2019s signature look, and it\u2019s been replaced by a more matte finish that\u2019s a little more plastic in appearance (which is a shame since, we hasten to add, they still feature lots of metal in their construction). \nThe PX Wireless are available in two color schemes, \u2018Space Grey\u2019 or \u2018Soft Gold\u2019, and we think the design suits the latter much more than the former. The grey color scheme might be understated, but it feels a little drab compared to the company\u2019s previous efforts. \nThankfully while the look might look a little more understated, the build quality is anything but, with a chunky-yet-sleek construction that feels sturdy in the hand and on the head. The companion app \nLike many others, the B&W PX Wireless feature a companion app. Here you\u2019ll be able to change the type of noise-cancelling applied, and you can also turn off the wear sensor functionality. Although this latter option is great to have, we were happy to pretty much leave the noise-cancellation settings at their defaults. \nThe feature-set of the headphones is a master-class in covering all the bases of a modern pair of headphones. Charging by USB-C? Check. A non-proprietary 3.5mm jack? Check. A complete set of physical button controls? Check. A respectable 22 hours of battery life? Check. Bluetooth aptX HD support? Check. \nAt this point, every pair of wireless noise-cancelling headphones should embrace this standard checklist of features. They\u2019re small touches, but they\u2019ll go a long way to making the headphones as easy to use as possible. \nMore impressive is the ability of the headphones to understand when you\u2019re using them and when you\u2019re not. After an initial pairing process you\u2019ll be able to turn the headphones on and off simply by taking them on and off. You can even pause them by lifting just one of the earcups off your ear. \nIt\u2019s a great feature, and definitely helps you to maximise the headphones\u2019 battery life since there\u2019s no chance of you taking them off and forgetting to turn them off. \nOccasionally the technology can misfire. There were a couple of moments when we paused our music with the headphones still on our head, only for it to resume playing after a couple of seconds in confusion, but these problems were few and far between, and it\u2019s possible to change the sensitivity of the functionality in the companion app. The headphones feature the standard suite of physical buttons. Noise-cancelling performance \nConsidering it\u2019s Bowers and Wilkins\u2019 first attempt at noise-cancellation, it\u2019s perhaps surprising that this functionality is the most impressive part of the headphones. \nWe tried the PX Wireless on a noisy subway train during rush hour using their default (ie \u2018Flight\u2019) noise-cancellation settings and they performed admirably, with a level of cancellation that\u2019s up there with the likes of Bose and Sony. \nFor those who want a more granular level of control, a companion app allows you to choose between three different noise-cancelling modes, with each designed to cancel and let through certain frequencies more than others. \n\u2018City\u2019, for example, is designed to let through traffic noise so that you can walk the streets while safely wearing the headphones, while \u2018Office\u2019 lets through higher-frequency voices so colleagues can talk to you. Finally, \u2018Flight\u2019 is focussed on eliminating the low rumble of a plane\u2019s engines. \nFor the most part we were content to leave the headphones set on \u2018Flight\u2019, as this appeared to cancel out the most amount of noise overall. \u2018City\u2019 was helpful for occasionally using the headphones while walking out and about, but we left \u2018Office\u2019 alone, simply because the sound of our colleagues is exactly what we\u2019re trying to avoid. You mileage may, however, vary. Sound quality \nWe love the functionality of the Bower and Wilkins PX Wireless, and its noise-cancellation easily competes with the established players, but its sound quality doesn't quite hit the same highs as we've come to expect from B&W. \nThe biggest problem is the mids and trebles, which have a fuzziness to them that means complex soundstages can end up feeling a little squashed. \nListen to the likes of Radio Protector by 65daysofstatic and when the song really gets going the headphones make the sound feel messier and noisier than it should be. \nOverall this leads to a loss of detail that, while not the worst we've ever experienced, is a step behind what we would have hoped for at this price point. \nAt the bassier end of the spectrum the PX Wireless fair a great deal better. Play Freeze Me by Death from Above 1979 and its driving bass line is present in spades. It's tight, it's punchy, and its given the space to really hold the song together. \nIt feels odd to complain too much about the sound quality of the PX Wireless, but its a sign of just how mainstream noise-cancellation technology has become that at this price point we're able to expect a premium sound quality in addition to everything else the headphones offer. The PX Wireless are nicely slimline while you wear them. Verdict \nFunctionally, the PX Wireless are a perfect pair of headphones. Their fit is comfortable, their noise-cancellation is great, and their impressive ability to automatically turn on and off as appropriate should mean that you're able to squeeze every drop out of their reasonable battery life. \nBut, in their noble effort to offer as much functionality as possible, sound quality has unfortunately been compromised. It's not that it's bad, but in 2017 you can and should expect more from a premium-priced pair of headphones, even if they do come equipped with noise-cancellation. \nWe now live in a world where a pair of headphones such as the AKG N60AC Wireless can come out at a mid-range price point while offering much the same functionality of the PX Wireless. \nSo, ultimately, the Bowers and Wilkins PX Wireless are a good pair of headphones, but they're asking price is just a little higher than you'd expect considering their sound quality.

Shares \nThis feature has been brought to you by Decluttr. \nEvery year Apple flips the consumer device market on its head with the release of the latest iPhone. This year in particular looks to be really exciting as the iPhone X offers a number of improvements and new features that will help it stand out from its predecessors. \nUpgrading to the newest iPhone is quite popular among consumers as Apple\u2019s smartphones tend to hold their value better than their Android counterparts. However, selling your old iPhone online or to a store can be a burdensome process and Apple\u2019s own Trade-up program will not necessarily always give you the best value for your device. \nBy using Decluttr to sell your old smartphones and other electronics, you can get the best price as they pay 25 per cent more than the market price and 33 per cent more than carriers and device manufacturers. They pay up to $451 for your iPhone , which will go a long way in contributing to the hefty $999 price tag held by the IPhone X. \nCash is better than credit \nApple knows that its customers want nothing less than its latest and greatest smartphones and that is why the company has introduced both a Trade-up and a recycling program to help users get rid of their old devices. However, selling your iPhone this way will only get you credit that can be used at an Apple Store or on its website. With Decluttr, you are paid in cash the day after sending in your device via direct deposit, check or even PayPal so you have the freedom to shop around and find the best deals on the latest iPhone. \nTo get started with Declutter visit its website . From there, just search for your device, list its condition and the company will give you a quote. Decluttr even offers a price promise guarantee and you will be paid your initial offer price for your iPhone or it will be sent back to you free of charge. \nSkip the auction \nSelling your old iPhone on popular auction sites such as eBay may seem like a good idea but the added hassle and time required to do so makes this option pale in comparison to Decluttr. Not only will you have to worry about questions and complaints from sellers but you will also have to pay to ship your device out of your own pocket. Decluttr on the other hand provides users with free insured shipping so you don\u2019t have to worry about your package being damaged or even lost in the mail. There are also no additional auction or seller fees when using the service which can\u2019t be said for the alternatives. \nSimplify the process of selling your old iPhone \nEach iPhone brings with it a host of new features and upgrades that makes purchasing the latest model quite tempting for any consumer. While going through your carrier or even Apple can be a costly process, using Decluttr just isn\u2019t. The company will give you the most money for your old devices in a simple and efficient way without any added hassles or hidden fees. \nSelling your old iPhone on Decluttr is so simple that you may even want to free up some space around your house by getting rid of the rest of your unused electronics, CDs, DVDs, games and game consoles as well. The good news is all of these items can all be sold through the service, helping you clear the house and earn cash to put towards Apple\u2019s latest iPhone. \nTechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Canon EOS Rebel T7i / EOS 800D \nEntry-level DSLRs deliver a big step up in image quality from a compact camera or smartphone, offering far more manual control and the ability to change lenses to tackle a huge variety of projects. Don't worry though \u2013 there are also a host of auto modes to help you out until you're comfortable with the more creative controls. \nObviously, the more features you want, the more you'll pay, but do you actually need them? Our top camera is one of the cheapest on the market, but still offers impressive performance and image quality, plus enough features to handle most assignments, especially if you're still learning. DSLR bundles \nIf you're buying your first DSLR, it makes sense to go for a 'kit', which generally includes the camera body along with an 18-55mm lens. This covers a broad zoom range, perfect for everything from landscapes to portraits, but that's just the start. \nThe key advantage of DSLRs over compact cameras is that you can add to your kit with, for example, wide-angle and telephoto zoom lenses, a flashgun, and other accessories, to make the most of whatever types of photography you're into. \nCanon and Nikon offer the largest collections of DSLR lenses, but Pentax and Sony also offer decent ranges. You're not limited to own-brand lenses either, with the likes of Sigma, Tamron and Tokina selling quality lenses at prices that are often lower than the camera manufacturers' equivalent lenses. 1. Nikon D3300 \nIt's not the most expensive entry-level DSLR, but we think it's the best \nSensor: APS-C CMOS | Megapixels: 24.2MP | Lens mount: Nikon DX | Screen: 3-inch, 921,000 dots | Continuous shooting speed: 5fps | Max video resolution: 1080p | User level: Beginner Great image quality Fixed screen No built-in Wi-Fi \nNikon's D3400 might have replaced it, but the D3300 is still our top pick. Why? Unless you want improved connectivity, then the D3300 is pretty much identical to the D3400 and for now at least, is just that bit cheaper. The 24.2MP sensor resolves bags of detail and like much like pricier Nikon DSLRs, it does away with an anti-aliasing filter to maximise image sharpness. This is also a very easy camera to live with. Its clever Guide Mode is a useful learning tool that gives real-time explanations of important features, whilst the collapsible 18-55mm kit lens is great when you're on the go. It's a shame you don't get an articulated touchscreen display (you'll want the D5600 if that's what you're after) or Wi-Fi connectivity, but Nikon does make a cheap plug-in Wi-Fi adaptor if that's a deal-breaker for you. \nRead the full review: Nikon D3300 2. Canon EOS Rebel T6i / Canon EOS 750D \nA compelling combination of top-notch ergonomics and a superb sensor \nSensor: APS-C CMOS | Megapixels: 24.2MP | Lens mount: Canon EF-S | Screen: 3-inch articulating touchscreen, 1,040,000 dots | Continuous shooting speed: 5fps | Max video resolution: 1080p | User level: Beginner/enthusiast Terrific sensor Average battery life Only 95% viewfinder coverage \nNikon doesn't have things all to itself because paying a bit more cash will get you quite a lot more camera. The EOS Rebel T6i (Called the EOS 750D outside the US) may have just been superseded by the EOS Rebel T7i / 800D, but due to the fairly hefty price difference, the older model edges it here. It also means there's a chance to track down a good deal on this great entry-level DSLR. Featuring a 24.2MP sensor that delivers stunning image quality, there's a solid AF system, built-in Wi-Fi with NFC pairing and a articulating, touch-sensitive screen that's a enjoy to use. 3. Nikon D3400 \nA great entry-level DSLR that's becoming an even more tempting proposition \nSensor: APS-C CMOS | Megapixels: 24.2MP | Lens mount: Nikon DX | Screen: 3-inch, 921,000 dots | Continuous shooting speed: 5fps | Max video resolution: 1080p | User level: Beginner Superb battery life No microphone port No touchscreen \nNikon's latest entry-level DSLR is almost identical in specification to the D3300 - our top pick here, but adds Nikon's SnapBridge bluetooth connectivity to transfer images directly to your smart device to make it that much easier to share image. The D3400 is a very good entry-level DSLR, with a range of features to appeal to new users. One of the newest cameras here means the D3300 is a bit better value for money at the moment, but the price of the D3400 has dropped quite a bit since its launch late last year. If you opt for this over the D3300, you won't be disappointed. \nRead the full review: Nikon D3400 4. Nikon D5600 \nChoosing between Canon and Nikon is tougher than ever \nSensor: APS-C CMOS | Megapixels: 24.2MP | Lens mount: Nikon DX | Screen: 3.2-inch articulating touchscreen, 1,040,000 dots | Continuous shooting speed: 5fps | Max video resolution: 1080p | User level: Beginner/enthusiast Excellent image quality Slow Live View focusing SnapBridge needs work \nThe D5600 replaces the D5500 and competes directly with Canon's EOS Rebel T7i / EOS 800D at the upper end of the entry-level DSLR market. Where Nikon's D3000-series cameras are designed as cost-conscious introductory DSLRs, the D5000-series is preferable if you want to get more creative. The D5600 sports a large 3.2-inch vari-angle touchscreen, and while the live view focusing speed could be quicker, the 39-point AF does an excellent job. There isn't much wrong with the D5600's 24.2MP sensor either, delivering excellent results, while the logical control layout of the D5600 makes it easy to use. \nRead the full review: Nikon D5600 5. Canon EOS Rebel T7i / Canon EOS 800D \nOne of the best options out there, but a bit pricey \nSensor: APS-C CMOS | Megapixels: 24.2MP | Lens mount: Canon EF-S | Screen: 3-inch articulating touchscreen, 1,040,000 dots | Continuous shooting speed: 6fps | Max video resolution: 1080p | User level: Beginner/enthusiast Great touchscreen Plastic finish Expensive \nThe EOS Rebel T7i (known as the EOS 800D outside) is an update to the EOS Rebel T6i / 750D. The resolution stays the same, but it's a new design with an improved high ISO performance. The autofocus also gets a boost, now with a 45-point arrangement that's backed up by excellent live view AF, while the newly designed graphical interface will certainly make this camera even more appealing to new users. The absence of 4K video and the quality of the exterior materials disappoint, but the biggest sticking point at the moment is the price compared to rivals. Until this drops (which it will), get the T6i / 750D and with the money saved, get a new lens or camera accessory. 6. Nikon D5300 \nNo longer Nikon's latest and greatest entry-level DSLR, but almost \nSensor: APS-C CMOS | Megapixels: 24.2MP | Lens mount: Nikon DX | Screen: 3.2-inch articulating, 1,037,000 dots | Continuous shooting speed: 5fps | Max video resolution: 1080p | User level: Beginner/enthusiast High-res, non-anti-aliased sensor Slow live-view focussing No touchscreen \nThe D5300 was around for little more than a year before the D5500 technically replaced it. It shares the same 24.2MP sensor with an identical maximum ISO25,600 sensitivity as the D5500, whilst the D5300's EXPEED 4 image processor and 39-point autofocus system have also been carried over to its replacement. Whilst the D5300 doesn't sport fancy touchscreen control, you do get GPS instead. The D5300's 600-shot battery life has since been beaten by the D5500, but it'll still outlast a Canon T6i / 750D. All in all, it may not be the latest entry-level DSLR, but the D5300 is still a smart buy. \nRead the full review: Nikon D5300 7. Canon EOS Rebel T5i / Canon EOS 700D \nStill fresh on the outside, if a little long in the tooth within \nSensor: APS-C CMOS | Megapixels: 18MP | Lens mount: Canon EF-S | Screen: 3-inch articulating touchscreen, 1,040,000 dots | Continuous shooting speed: 5fps | Max video resolution: 1080p | User level: Beginner/enthusiast Superb ergonomics Outdated sensor No Wi-Fi \nStick the EOS Rebel T5i / 700D next to the T6i / 750D and you'll struggle to tell them apart, as the new camera inherits the T5i's excellent ergonomics and class-leading touch-sensitive screen. Even the good old button controls are more comprehensive than on rival Nikons, making the T5i intuitive to use, regardless of your ability. However, the T5i's sensor can trace its roots back to the T2i released in 2010 and it's now outclassed in terms of noise suppression and dynamic range. The 9-point autofocus system is also dated and you don't get Wi-Fi connectivity. The T5i's slashed price does make it a tempter, but the T6i is a more future-proof choice. Now we've got the new EOS Rebel T7i / EOS 800D, expect to see this start to disappear from shop shelves soon. 8. Canon EOS Rebel SL1 / Canon EOS 200D \nA cheap and very cheerful entry level camera \nSensor: APS-C CMOS | Megapixels: 24.2MP | Lens mount: Canon EF-S | Screen: 3-inch vari-angle touchscreen, 1,040,000 dots | Continuous shooting speed: 5fps | Max video resolution: 1080p | User level: Beginner Small size Battery life rated at 380 shots Fixed rather than vari-angle screen \nCanon introduced the EOS Rebel SL1 (EOS 100D outside the US) to compete with the influx of compact system cameras and it was the smallest DSLR available when it was introduced in March 2013. Now replaced by the EOS Rebel SL2 (EOS 200D), its slightly bulkier proportions make it feel more like a slightly pared-down Rebel T7i / 800D than anything unique. It's not a bad option for new users, but there are better-value alternatives available at the moment. 9. Canon EOS Rebel T6 / Canon EOS 1300D \nGreat camera that replaces the EOS 1200D \nSensor: APS-C CMOS | Megapixels: 18MP | Lens mount: Canon EF-S | Screen: 3-inch, 920,000 dots | Continuous shooting speed: 3fps | Max video resolution: 1080p | User level: Beginner Low price No touchscreen Slow live view focusing \nThe EOS Rebel T6 (known as the EOS 1300D outside the US) uses the same sensor as the camera it replaces, the T5 / 1200D, but it has a newer processing engine and this enables it to produce slightly better quality images. In reality you're unlikely to be able to spot much difference at normal image viewing sizes though, so it's not a real biggie. Where the EOS Rebel T6 does score over the T5 though is the connectivity department; its got Wi-Fi and NFC technology built-in. This means you can transfer images to your smartphone for super-quick sharing. You can also use your phone to control the camera remotely, which is ideal for taking group shots with you in the frame. The screen has also been upgraded from a 3-inch 460K dot unit to one with 920K dots, which makes images look much sharper. 10. Pentax K-70 \nRugged build offers decent protection for an entry-level DSLR \nSensor: APS-C CMOS | Megapixels: 24.2MP | Lens mount: Pentax K | Screen: 3-inch articulating screen, 921,000 dots | Continuous shooting speed: 6fps | Max video resolution: 1080p | User level: Beginner/enthusiast Weatherproof Few AF points Poor kit lens \nPentax is renowned for producing DSLRs with maximum bang per buck, and the K-70 is no exception. Weatherproof DSLRs that are rain and dust resistant usually cost a packet, but the K-70 offers this protection at a reasonable so you can shoot in all conditions. Just remember that you'll have to partner it with more expensive WR (weather resistant) lenses to get the full benefit. Regardless of the lens you use, the new hybrid live view autofocus system \u2013 a first for Pentax \u2013 makes live view shooting an enjoyable and practical alternative to using the viewfinder. Pentax's in-camera Shake Reduction system cuts camera shake and can even correct slightly skewed horizons. The only reason the K-70 isn't higher on our list is Pentax's relatively restricted lens range.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tokina", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon eos rebel t7i / canon eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon eos rebel t6i / canon eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon eos rebel t5i / canon eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon eos rebel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pentax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dslr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "expeed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sigma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:34:12.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4119200a9048e1a237bfbb1e5d3de319a3411364", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG32vBQgddSn3FDNGKRYRT9do_1cwaJA7823N4Ic5ZbDe4-", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - Technology Reviews", "title": "Nuraphone", "title_full": "Nuraphone headphones review | TechRadar", "published": "2017-10-03T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HYPQecuHULKAniysCBJTSP-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 20, "comments": 0, "shares": 20}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4119200a9048e1a237bfbb1e5d3de319a3411364", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG32vBQgddSn3FDNGKRYRT9do_1cwaJA7823N4Ic5ZbDe4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nuraphone", "text": "Never before have we seen a pair of headphones try so many interesting things. \nAfter having been successfully funded on KickStarter, Nura\u2019s debut pair of headphones, the Nuraphones, are finally available to buy as a finished product. \nTo say that these are a pair of headphones that are trying something new would be an understatement. Not only do they have a unique in-ear/over-ear hybrid design, they also claim to be able to tailor their sound to the way you listen to music and feature a sleek design devoid of many of the buttons common on wireless headphones. \nUltimately they succeed with much that they attempt. The form-factor worked much better than we expected it to, the sound personalisation adds an interesting element, and overall the headphones offer a great level of sound quality. \nCheck out our video review of the Nuraphones below. \nBut at a certain point these $399 (\u00a3349) headphones can start to feel a little over-engineered, and perhaps a little too clever for their own good. Having headphones that can sense when you\u2019re using them and turn themselves on and off accordingly is certainly clever, but on the occasions that it doesn\u2019t you\u2019ll wish Nura had just included an \u2018Off\u2019 button. \nSo too does the sound personalisation mostly work, but isn\u2019t quite the gamechanger that we\u2019d have hoped. \nUltimately Nura should be commended for aiming high with their debut product, it\u2019s just a shame that not every shot has paid off. \nDesign and features There\u2019s a lot to discuss when it comes to the design of the Nuraphones. After all, this is a pair of headphones that almost consciously distances itself from the conventional wisdom surrounding most of its competitors. \nThis mentality is first apparent with their form factor. Look at someone wearing them, and the Nuraphones appear to be a fairly standard pair of over-ear headphones. They\u2019ve got a slightly featureless plastic matt black design that, while not exactly boring looking, would fail to stand out in a crowd. \nBut take a peek on the inside of the headphones and you\u2019ll immediately notice a pair of earbuds suspended within the wider cup. \nIf you\u2019re anything like us you\u2019ll immediately become suspicious of this design choice. Every pair of ears is shaped slightly differently after all, and it seems impossible that these earbuds would be able to fit inside any pair of ears. \n\nCooling Tesla valves The headphones feature a pretty interesting valve mechanism which Nura claims keeps your ears cool over long listening periods. The holes along the bottom and top of the headphones feature tiny Tesla valves that suck in cool air from below the headphones and expel warm air out of the top. \nIn practice, the headphones didn\u2019t get too hot and stuffy, but we imagine this had more to do with the silicon construction rather than technology from the famous inventor. \nBut after both trying out the headphones on ourselves and a number of our colleagues in the office it seems these fears were unfounded. The earbud portion of the headphones have just enough flex in them to bend to the needs of your ears, and the result is a surprisingly comfortable fit.\nOstensibly this form factor was a decision made to benefit sound quality since it allows both an in-ear and an over-ear acoustic driver to be used in parallel, but for us the bigger benefit was the boost it gives to sound isolation. \nTheir form factor means you\u2019ve not only got an earbud sitting at the entrance of your ear canal, but also an over-ear cushion sitting over your entire ear. This effectively means you\u2019ve got two physical barriers meaning that the noise from the outside world can\u2019t get to your ears. \nTo be clear, the Nuraphones are not noise-cancelling headphones, but their form factor blocks out high-frequency sounds (such as office chatter) better than any other pair of headphones we\u2019ve ever used. \nUnfortunately, the lack of active noise-cancellation means that you\u2019ll still hear a lot of low-frequency background noise when using the headphones, which includes train or plane noise.\nAlthough the earbud sits nicely in your ear when you\u2019re wearing the headphones properly, their presence does mean that the Nuraphones are pretty uncomfortable to wear any other way. Trust us when we say that you\u2019re not going to want to wear these headphones with just one earcup on. \nSetup and sound personalisation A key selling point of the Nuraphones is their ability to measure the sensitivity of your ears and adjust their sound so that you hear the maximum amount of detail in your music. \nThe thinking goes that different people\u2019s ears hear different frequencies at different volume levels. Some people\u2019s ears might be very sensitive to lower frequencies and less sensitive to higher frequencies, or vice versa. \nThis sound profiling means that the setup of these headphones is a little more involved than usual, and makes the usually optional headphone app an essential part of the experience. \nThe setup feels a little surreal in practice. After telling the app that you want to set up a new profile it will first establish that the headphones are firmly fixed in your ears, before playing a variety of frequencies into your ears. \n\nThe different sound profiles are shown graphically in the Nuraphone app. According to Nura this process works by measuring the faint sounds emitted by your ears when they hear audio using a process known as otoacoustic emission. \nOnce the test has been performed, you\u2019ll have the option of listening to music both with, and without, the sound personalisation effect applied. \nUnsurprisingly, the personalised sound profile sounds a lot better than the \u2018generic\u2019 profile, but it\u2019s a little odd just how bad the generic profile sounds. \nAfter all, every other pair of headphones we\u2019ve ever used has essentially been using a non-personalised \u2018generic\u2019 profile, and every single one of them sounds better than the generic profile setting on the Nuraphones. \nSo it\u2019s a little difficult to work out if the sound personalisation technology is worth it at this stage, but thankfully the headphones allow you to set up a maximum of three different profiles for different listeners. \nClever charging The Nuraphones are the first pair of wireless headphones we\u2019ve seen that are able to charge directly from your phone. It works so well that we\u2019re astounded more headphone manufacturers don\u2019t do it. When plugged in music transfers over the cable directly, and this features a set of in-line controls. \nIn theory then, your own sound profile should sound superior to anyone else\u2019s. In practice this seemed to bear out, though it didn\u2019t quite happen 100% of the time. \nWe tested this out by having various members of the TechRadar office go through the setup process to create a sound profile. We then had them listen to a song of their choosing, while we switched between different sound profiles. \nWithout telling them which two profiles they were listening to, we then asked which they preferred. \nOverall, people tended to prefer the sound of their own profile, but this didn\u2019t happen 100% of the time, suggesting that the differences in profiles between two people can be very slight. \nSo it seems the sound profiling broadly does create a better sound for individual listeners, but depending on how average your hearing is, the difference might be difficult to perceive.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "nuraphones", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:45:48.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1cdf44f91414840a06acbccc3566da67f51ec4cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3WVrkpvdrAoS4JstN27dm_0jnYgLh7UxVWiO0.5InZR3YRUd4FFIaXRp.rG_fQ5AA0S02iWj7EyDr57JgjF4gDxdF_L4S2aHw9RAL0GyyndAeHOiT3Z.SKw--", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://techradar.com//rss/news/software", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - Software news", "title": "The best free presentation software 2017", "title_full": "The best free presentation software 2017", "published": "2017-10-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/miVFbvL8dCXs2TBuCKYFSM-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 28, "comments": 0, "shares": 28}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 5}, "linkedin": {"shares": 54}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1cdf44f91414840a06acbccc3566da67f51ec4cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3WVrkpvdrAoS4JstN27dm_0jnYgLh7UxVWiO0.5InZR3YRUd4FFIaXRp.rG_fQ5AA0S02iWj7EyDr57JgjF4gDxdF_L4S2aHw9RAL0GyyndAeHOiT3Z.SKw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alex Cox,Cat Ellis", "published": "2017-10-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The best free presentation software 2017", "text": "The best free presentation software 2017 The best free presentation software 2017 Make stunning slideshows and stop your audience nodding off Shares \nYou know what it's like to sit through a bad presentation \u2013 slides packed with dense text and cheesy transitions leaving you confused, bored, or both. \nBut it doesn't have to be that way. A presentation with engaging visuals and creative use of animation can really grab an audience's attention, get them engaged, and make sure they actually remember the information. \nAlthough Microsoft Powerpoint has become almost synonymous with presentations, it isn't the only way to get your slides on screen. If you don't fancy paying for a Microsoft Office subscription, there are lots of free tools that will help you create attention-grabbing slideshows, and are quick and easy to use. \nA powerful tool for making engaging presentations Supports Microsoft file formats Great multimedia options Modern Microsoft Office style design \nOnce known as Kingsoft Office, WPS Office Free is, in interface terms, about as close to Microsoft's office software as you're likely to find. WPS Presentation (its PowerPoint-alike) has enough muscle to perform just about every task you'd expect of a slideshow app. \nWPS Presentation is fully compatible with PPT and PPTX files, and incredibly stable \u2013 as you might expect from commercial software that's been around for this long. The range of templates on offer is particularly impressive, and there's also a stack of animations, transitions and effects to choose from. There's even support for embedding numerous different file types including Flash SWF files and most video formats. \nThis flexibility makes WPS Office the best free presentation software. Read on for four more of the best tools for bringing your slideshows to life. \nVery capable, though lacking a dab of professional polish Supports embedded fonts Lots of export options Looks a little dated \nLibreOffice 's free presentation software, Impress, has an, er, impressive pedigree. It also has a raft of features and templates at its disposal, but don't make the mistake of thinking it's an exact PowerPoint analog. \nCertain features of more modern PowerPoint versions aren't included (internet broadcast, collaboration, animated diagrams) though LibreOffice Impress adds some pretty cool features of its own, like various export formats including SWF, import compatibility with Keynote files, and full support for embedding fonts in your presentations. Plus, of course, it's completely free open source software. \nThere's another benefit, too: you'll need to do some heavy work to get Office 365 running on anything earlier than Windows 7, but LibreOffice Impress maintains compatibility right back to Windows XP. \nReview and where to download: LibreOffice \nThe finesse you'd expect from Apple in an online presentation app Plenty of export formats Simple, web-based interface Less powerful than desktop app \nApple's flagship presentation software is, in our opinion, the best part of the suite formerly known as iWork, and it's free to anyone who owns a post-2013 Mac. However, we think Keynote's best incarnation is the one that comes as part of its iCloud online app suite , mainly because anyone with an Apple ID \u2013 whether they're using macOS, Windows or Linux \u2013 gets free access through a web browser. \niCloud Keynote a pretty good translation of the package, though it's a little closer to the iOS version than the desktop one. This means there are a few caveats you'll have to live with. Documents created with the full version sometimes include elements which aren't supported by the online version, and while you'll have no problem creating some very flashy presentations with the numerous 4:3 and 16:9 templates, the simplistic tools mean they won't match the complexity of those created by its desktop counterpart. \nAnything you do create can be shared online by sending simple link to any recipient, or you can take your pick of Keynote, PDF or Powerpoint downloads.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "kingsoft office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wps office free", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libreoffice impress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft powerpoint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modern microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libreoffice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wps office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:24:54.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67916ca65ea5536ba8939c223aa776b18112ddd0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3MjvvjsoEM4HTTucd2p99NmS8ihcHxPeB3iU4W6NWOAoT2zhkGdSMbD0_y1EHc5ZN1rJmH85AdPyKaUnGkgssdQWNra8QGbS9", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/au/rss/news/phone-and-communications", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - Phone and communications news", "title": "Best phones of 2017 in India: the 10 top smartphones we've tested", "title_full": "Best phones of 2017 in India: the 10 top smartphones we've tested", "published": "2017-10-03T14:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mffc35PH77Dq7USrHb4qNm-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4484, "comments": 0, "shares": 4484}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 5}, "linkedin": {"shares": 13}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67916ca65ea5536ba8939c223aa776b18112ddd0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3MjvvjsoEM4HTTucd2p99NmS8ihcHxPeB3iU4W6NWOAoT2zhkGdSMbD0_y1EHc5ZN1rJmH85AdPyKaUnGkgssdQWNra8QGbS9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TechRadar India Bureau", "published": "2017-10-03T14:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best phones of 2017 in India: the 10 top smartphones we've tested", "text": "You might also like...

Our price comparison engine checks the prices for all these phones several times a day and lists them all cheapest-first so you can be sure we\u2019re always linking you to the best prices!\nSIM-free phones have become increasingly popular in the last few years. When big phones like the iPhone 7 or Samsung Galaxy S8 go on sale, they\u2019re usually very expensive. So expensive, in fact, that it can be cheaper to buy the phones SIM-free and pair them with SIM only deals from one of the networks.\nWhat\u2019s more, mobile phones are a lot better than they used to be and that means people are hanging on to their phones beyond the traditional 24 month contract, pairing their existing phones with a SIM only deal at the end of their contract. It's a great way to bridge the gap before snaffling a fresh bargain Black Friday deal .\nOn this page we\u2019re listing the best SIM-free phone deals for all of the world\u2019s best phones. We\u2019ve also got the best prices for some of the budget favourites like the Moto G and nostalgic Nokia 3310 .\n1. Moto G5 Brand new for 2017, this is the best 'cheap Android phone'\nWeight: 145g | Dimensions: 144.3 x 73 x 9.5mm | OS: Android 7 Nougat | Screen size: 5.0-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Octa-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 | RAM: 2/3GB | Storage: 16GB/32GB | Battery: 2800mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP\nSlimmer and lighter than Moto G4 Excellent HD screen Decent camera Slick fingerprint sensor The Moto G series has been the leader in the budget Android smartphone market for years now. The latest phone is always a lot better than similarly priced phones and almost as good as phones that cost more than twice the price. If you're after a really good phone but don't want to spend too much money it's always a great option. The 2017 model we have here is a tad smaller than last year's G4 (5.0-inch versus 5.5-inch) but if you want a slightly bigger screen you could always go for the Moto G5 Plus.\n2. Moto G5 Plus Slightly bigger and better than the Moto G5\nWeight: 155g | Dimensions: 150.2 x 74 x 7.7mm | OS: Android 7 Nougat | Screen size: 5.2-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 625 | RAM: 2/3/4GB | Storage: 16GB/32GB | Battery: 3000mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP\nLooks and feels premium Amazing value for money Decent screen Camera not as good as G4 Plus If you like the look of the Moto G5 but fancy a slightly bigger screen then the Moto G5 Plus could be the phone for you. It's slightly more powerful too and looks and feels far more premium than the price would suggest. It charges super fast, and has convenient features such as fingerprint sensor and much more. If you want to go even bigger, check out last year's Moto G4 Plus which measures 5.5-inches and is included below.\n3. iPhone SE The 'cheap iPhone' option is a good bet if you want Apple on a budget\nWeight: 143g | Dimensions: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4-inch | Resolution: 640 x 1136 | CPU: Apple A9 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16/64GB | Battery: 1624mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 1.2MP\nCheap for an iPhone Simple to use Just like the iPhone 5S but better Lacks top features If you want a cheap iPhone then the iPhone SE is the best SIM-free phone to go for at the moment. It is not as powerful compared to the iPhone 6S or iPhone 7 but it is a step up from the iPhone 5S and crucially retains the 5S' size and shape which is ideal for anyone who wants an iPhone but doesn't want a phone with a massive screen.\n4. OnePlus 3T A top smartphone for those that want the best on a budget\nWeight: 158g | Dimensions: 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 821 | RAM: 6GB | Storage: 64GB/128GB | Battery: 3400mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 16MP\nPremium phone design Good battery life No microSD slot Camera not the best If you're after a high-end Android handset but don't quite want to pay high-end prices, the OnePlus 3T is the phone for you. It's got everything - stunning AMOLED 5.5-inch screen, fingerprint scanner, excellent battery life and lots more. And the best bit is that it costs a lot less than the equivalent phones from the bigger brands.\n5. Samsung Galaxy S7 Last year's Samsung flagship is still a brilliant phone in every way\nWeight: 152g | Dimensions: 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.1-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Exynos 8890 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB/64GB | Battery: 3000mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP\nBrilliant design Lovely screen and lots of power Attracts fingerprints The Samsung Galaxy S7 phones sit at the pinnacle of the smartphone world right now - they're the best selling Android handsets out there. The S7 is very similar to the S7 Edge (below), containing most of the same components. The main difference is a slightly smaller screen that's flat rather than curved. It sat at number 2 in TechRadar's best phones ranking for a year so yeah, it's brilliant. In terms of outright value for money, the S7 is probably the better option.\n6. Nokia 3310 A throwback to phones of yore...when batteries lasted more than a day\nWeight: 79.6g | Dimensions: 115.6 x 51 x 12.8 mm **Screen size:** 2.4-inch | Resolution: 320 x 240 **RAM:** 16MB | Storage: 16MB | Battery: 1200mAh | Rear camera: 2MP\nLow price Incredible battery Poor camera Only 2.5G coverage Welcome back, old friend! Pure nostalgia may be the primary jet-fuel that makes this revamped classic fly off the shelves, but for such a low price this may genuinely suit you as a second device to take to festivals or keep in your bag for emergencies. It's some way off the capabilities of actual smartphones, but...well, did we mention Snake?\n7. Nokia 6 Premium - yet affordable - Android phone from Nokia\nScreen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | Rear camera: 16MP | Weight: 169g | OS: Android 7 Nougat | RAM: 3/4GB | Storage: 32/64GB | External storage: microSD up to 256GB | Battery: 3000mAh\nBeautiful metallic build Full HD display Attractive price point Performance doesn't impress Solid specs. Full HD display. Premium metal casing. And all for a very affordable price. There isn't much not to like about the Nokia 6. And possibly its best feature is the way it runs from the stock Android 7 interface, making it an absolute doddle to use. It's never going to match the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S8 for pure processing power, but you can always pay a little more for the Arte version if you think you'll need more RAM.\n8. LG G5 A cheap SIM-free phone that matches more expensive options\nWeight: 159g | Dimensions: 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.3-inch | Resolution: 2560 x 1440 | CPU: value | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB | Battery: 2800mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 8MP\nGreat performance Cheap price Decent wide angle camera Battery could be better LG phones have been very strong for the last couple of years. The LG G5 is only a year old but the SIM-free price has already dropped quite considerably which makes it a great option for a SIM-free phone purchase. It's got a great screen, a dual-camera and many other features that cheap phones don't usually have. A great option.\n9. Moto G4 Last year's best cheap phone is still excellent\nWeight: 155g | Dimensions: 153 x 76.6 x 9.8mm | OS: Android 6 Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 617 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB/32GB | Battery: 3000mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP\nBrilliant phone at a great price Strong screen and camera Looks more expensive Lacks the power of pricier phones For less than \u00a3150 you can grab yourself the Motorola Moto G4 which is a brilliant budget Android SIM-free phone. In many ways it makes a mockery of the prices that the other phones go for. It lacks the stunning build quality of a Samsung or an iPhone but it gets most of the way there and for a price that will have many people doing a double-take. One thing to note - the Moto G5 is now out and our review will be here very soon so this phone might soon be replaced on this list!\n10. Huawei Honor 8 An extraordinarily shiny Android phone that\u2019s extra ordinary\nWeight: 153g | Dimensions: 145.5 x 71 x 7.5 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.2-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | CPU: Kirin 950 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/64GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: Dual 12 MP | Front camera: 8MP\nAlluring reflective glass design Neat fingerprint sensor gestures Illogical software choices No OIS on the camera Huawei is a Chinese brand that has taken the smartphone world by storm in the last few years. And the Honor 8 is an all-metal and glass phone that could easily go for more money. It looks and feels really premium but the asking price is a step below other leading smartphone which makes it a great SIM-free option.\n11. iPhone 6S 2015's best iPhone is still a brilliant phone to this day\nWeight: 143g | Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 750 x 1334 | CPU: Apple A9 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16/32/128 | Battery: 1715mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP\nAlmost as good as iPhone 7 It's way cheaper than iPhone 7 Doesn't have the latest features Less bragging rights The iPhone 6S is no longer the best iPhone out there but it could be the best iPhone to buy if you want something decent without paying the Earth. It's well over \u00a3100 cheaper than the iPhone 7, after all, and yet it's exactly the same size, has a very similar screen and has most of the same features.\n12. Samsung Galaxy S8 The latest and greatest Samsung Galaxy phone is out now\nWeight: 155g | Dimensions: 148.9 x 68.1 x 8mm | OS: Android 7 Nougat | Screen size: 5.8-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2960 | CPU: Exynos 8895 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 64GB | Battery: 3000mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 8MP\nStunning screen Slick new UI Very powerful Empty List The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a superb phone and it's currently available to pre-order from various places. If you want it SIM-free you're going to have to pay around \u00a3689 which is a lot of money. Don't worry though, if that's way too much there are some great cheaper options further down the page. We'll be publishing our full Samsung Galaxy S8 review soon so keep checking in for our full verdict.\n13. Apple iPhone 7 Far and away the western world's best selling phone\nWeight: 138g | Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 750 x 1334 | CPU: Apple A10 Fusion | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 1960mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 7MP\nGood low light camera Water resistant Battery life better but unimpressive Lacks clear upgrades The iPhone 7 is the most popular SIM-free phone out there. It's also the most popular contract phone out there. And so it was always going to make our list of the best SIM-free phone deals. Is it the best SIM-free iPhone to buy though? Only you can decide that - you'll probably see that the iPhone 6S offers most of the same features but is available for less.\n14. Google Pixel The best phone for pure Android\nWeight: 143g | Dimensions: 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5mm | OS: Android 7.1 | Screen size: 5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 821 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/128GB | Battery: 2770mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 8MP\nSupremely smooth performance Bright, colorful full HD display Battery life could be better Assistant yet to realize potential The Google Pixel is a super high-end Android phone and consequently you're unlikely to find cheap prices for it just yet. If you're after a brilliant Android phone though it's a super option. It's got perhaps the best camera of any phone out there right now, and because it's made by Google it's got Android baked into it from the ground up so it's super slick and easy to use.\n15. BlackBerry KEYone The return of the physical keyboard\nWeight: 180g | Dimensions: 149.1 x 72.4 x 9.4mm | OS: Android 7.1 Nougat | Screen size: 4.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1620 | CPU: Snapdragon 625 | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32GB | Battery: 3505mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 8MP\nPhysical keyboard Secure software Not ideal for entertainment Mediocre chipset The KEYone is a sophisticated smartphone made for business - sound familiar?\nYep, this is classic BlackBerry territory and it resurrects a physical keyboard for a modern Android audience. The QWERTY keyboard offers more than just nostalgia, while the smart and secure software will give businesses some peace of mind. Just know that the mid-range specs will only get you so far, as will the so-so entertainment capabilities", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "samsung galaxy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google pixel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung galaxy s8", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nokia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motorola moto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nokia  screen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:25:08.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45df858fc3a229e33f71f4b693f81d744b6cbcfb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3WVrkpvdrAoQ1SXbq3ORr7S7sDUFO1VlvPdwQH_3RSXjM6CGMXLpupzglvgziX.ZApX5zWwGGWfy318Rct_UK_sR7FBejo9ob", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - All the latest technology news", "title": "Some Ryzen 5 1600/X buyers have found their 6-core CPU has 8 cores", "title_full": "Some Ryzen 5 1600/X buyers have found their 6-core CPU has 8 cores", "published": "2017-10-03T14:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YXrLtochmQm6PoqVEjkSBJ-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 12, "comments": 0, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45df858fc3a229e33f71f4b693f81d744b6cbcfb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3WVrkpvdrAoQ1SXbq3ORr7S7sDUFO1VlvPdwQH_3RSXjM6CGMXLpupzglvgziX.ZApX5zWwGGWfy318Rct_UK_sR7FBejo9ob", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Darren Allan", "published": "2017-10-03T14:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Some Ryzen 5 1600/X buyers have found their 6-core CPU has 8 cores", "text": "Some Ryzen 5 1600/X buyers have found their 6-core CPU has 8 cores Some Ryzen 5 1600/X buyers have found their 6-core CPU has 8 cores Talk about winning big on the CPU lottery Shares \nSome folks who've bought Ryzen 5 1600 or 1600X processors have found that their chips have two more cores than expected, which can only be described as a massive win on the CPU lottery. \nThese CPUs should have six cores and 12 threads, but reports on Korean forums (spotted by Wccftech ) say some users have found they have eight cores (and 16 threads) out of the box. \nThe processors still run at the clock speeds quoted for the 1600X and 1600, but come with a pair of extra cores. And in the case of the former, the unlocked 1600X has the same clock speed as the 8-core 1800X , so buyers are effectively getting a much cheaper version of the latter (there are some other differences, though, like more cache in the flagship chip). \nTo give you an idea of just how lucky these buyers are, in the UK you can pick up the 1600X for as little as \u00a3190 (around $250, AU$320) now, whereas the 1800X will damage your wallet to the tune of \u00a3400 (around $530, AU$680). Clocking up the cores \nNormally, doing well on the so-called CPU lottery means you get a good chip which can be overclocked to a greater extent than the average model, not that you benefit from extra cores. \nQuite how AMD has allowed this to happen is unclear, but it could be a (desperate) move to fulfil a shortfall on stock with the mid-range processor, meaning the firm decided to utilize (presumably less in-demand) 8-core parts instead. Or it\u2019s some kind of a mistake, but that seems unlikely\u2026 \nWhatever the answer to the mystery, note that all the unlocked processors were made in Malaysia in the same week, so this probably only applies to a very limited batch of CPUs. \nStill, if you\u2019re in the market for a Ryzen 5 1600/X, you never know \u2013 you might be one of the lucky few lottery winners. \nIn other recent Ryzen news, we can hopefully look forward to testing out AMD\u2019s mobile processors with integrated Radeon Vega graphics before too long \u2013 these Ryzen offerings should juice up the power of notebooks nicely.

Huge capacity Travel-friendly Slightly weighty \nIf you're someone who travels for work a lot, staying powered up on the move may often prove a challenge. Although power banks for mobile devices have been popular for some time, anyone looking for a laptop equivalent could be caught short. However Orico's new SC28 offering provides a huge capacity that should be perfect for staying charged up on a trip. With a capacity of 28,800mAh, the SC28 provides easily enough juice for even the thirstiest laptops, which can be quickly recharged via USB or power socket. \nThe latter features a number of adaptors for different markets, meaning you should never be caught short, with Orico promising five hours of life for a 13in laptop. The SC28 can charge up to three devices at once, meaning you can power your laptop, phone and router all at once for the ideal mobile working solution. The device itself looks stylish, with a sleek aluminium alloy body that weighs in at just under 1kg, but should still easily slip into a rucksack or laptop bag. \nA stylish and premium noise-cancelling headset that\u2019s perfect for meetings, and music. Stylish design Some volume level issues Expensive \nIn modern busy offices, it can be tricky to get some quiet - particularly if you\u2019re trying to carry out a conference call or video meeting from your desk. Sennheiser, which is perhaps better known for its consumer headphone line, is looking to address this with a new headset targeted at business customers. \nThe MB 660 may resemble normal \u2018cans\u2019 style headphones, but in fact can act as a Bluetooth-enabled wireless headset, allowing you to use them as a meeting accessory in today\u2019s UC-dominated workplace. \nAs you would expect from a brand such as Sennheiser, the audio quality is excellent, whether that\u2019s with a voice call, watching video or even listening to music. This is complimented by the noise-cancelling ability of the headset, which comes with three separate settings that allow you to select your level of isolation. This high-standard audio quality does come at a price, but if you value your calls and media, it may be worth shelling out. \nThe headset comes with its own stylish and compact carry case, which also house the charging cables and USB connector. Battery life was excellent, with the headset not needing a recharge during our week-long test - and when we did plug it in, recharging was quick and effective. \nTake the notebook into the 21st century with Moleskine's Smart Writing Set. Innovative idea Overly complex compared to low-tech alternative Expensive \nIf you thought that the era of writing stuff down using pen and paper was dead, then Moleskine is here to prove you wrong. \nThe iconic notebook provider, well-known for its leather-bound pages, is embracing the technology world with its new Smart Writing Set , which it says combines the pleasure of writing with pen and paper with the ease and speed of editing offered by modern word processing software. \nThe kit consists of a smart Pen+ tool, which, when used to write on the accompanying 'Paper Tablet', will also display what you are writing on an accompanying phone or tablet device. Connected via Bluetooth, your device, boosted by the Moleskine Notes App, then allows you to record and edit your scribblings, meaning you can add extra colour, highlights and more. \nThe app, which is available on iOS and Android devices, stores all the writing done in your Paper Tablet, meaning you can delete or move pages across devices, and even sync using your Google Drive or Evernote account. \nAs for the kit itself, it resembles your traditional writing tools, with the Pen+ taking after a standard fountain pen - albeit with a hidden camera by the nib which traces and digitises everything you write. The Paper Tablet is slightly thicker than a usual Moleskine, but features NCode technology embedded in every page to allow the Pen+ to pick up your writing or drawing. \nAll in all, the device works well - once you're registered on the app, using the Pen+ is smooth, and the data transfer is effective, even if like us, you aren't particularly artistically-minded. But whilst this is clearly a clever product (and at \u00a3199, a premium one too...) there remains a slight nagging question about what it's trying to achieve. \nThose of us used to writing with a pen and pad will find some advantages, most notably the chance to edit and remove notes, but with tablet devices and lightweight laptops so commonplace today, it still seems like an odd choice of platform for Moleskine. \nA stylish battery charger that can power a MacBook Three ports that can deliver at least 3A Can power a MacBook Slippery casing 4-LED indicators \nJackery is a little known company that focuses - like so many out there - on producing portable laptop and smartphone chargers. Its flagship product is the massive PowerPro, a 500Whr/140Ah Portable Power station rechargeable battery pack, The Jackery Titan S is a portable battery (72.4Whr) that can not only charge your mobile or tablet but also, according to its manufacturer, the popular Apple MacBook laptop. \nWe didn\u2019t have one at hand to test that claim sadly; note that it is also available in orange which for some reason has a lower capacity. Its black metal aluminium casing ensures that it will survive more than a few drops and it does feel very solid. Shame though about the sharper-than-usual edges on both sides and we\u2019re not fans of the curvy profile of the Titan S as this caused it to slip a few times. \nThis is a portable charger/battery pack so don\u2019t expect too much innovation; it doesn\u2019t switch off automatically but does identify the connected device by itself, charging it at the maximum permitted power. \nOther than a big power button and a 4-led battery status indicators which means you will never really know when the item will be fully charged when you reach four blue dots or discharged when it shows one blue dot. \nThere are two full size USB ports - a 15W one (5V, 3A) and an 18W one (supporting variable voltages thanks to Quick Charge, up to 3.4A) - and a USB Type-C one that can deliver 15W power (5V, 3A); the latter can also be used to charge the battery. \nAt 155 x 80 x 22mm for a weight of 435g, it is a tad smaller (volume wise) and lighter than the Aukey Powerbank although the latter has a far superior capacity (30Ah compared to 20.1Ah). The Jackery Titan comes with a micro USB charging cable and a two-year warranty but no carry case. The item is out of stock in the UK at the time of writing. \nAn PIN-protected way to make sure your data stays secure. High-levels of security Hard-wearing design, but light and portable Works across multiple operating systems High price tag Some availability issues \nWith data security becoming paramount for many of us these days, the diskAshur Pro looks to offer a comprehensive security offering to ensure your important data stays intact. \nThe key selling point of the diskAshur Pro is its obvious physical security - the device comes with a keypad that will only grant access to the data stored within upon entering a PIN number. Far from your usual ATM PIN number though, the device requires an identifier between seven and 15 digits, offering far tougher security, with the number able to be quickly personalised and changed, in order to keep your data safe. \nAsides from the physical security (which extends to IP56 water and dust resistance and even a self-destruct feature), the diskAshur Pro also comes with some enviable encryption, sporting XTS-AES 256-bit real-time full disk hardware encryption and EDGE technology to offer even more levels of safety. \nThis version of the drive offers 500GB of storage, which should easily be enough to store all your vital documents, media and more, and connects to your PC or laptop via a standard USB 3.1 port. \nThe diskAshur Pro works across all major operating systems, including Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and Linux, and requires no extra additional software to be installed, meaning using the device is incredibly easy. \nGetting hold of the product may be the main issue with the diskAshur Pro, with the company manufacturing and selling many other models of the device on its site. We found this particular model for sale on Amazon for \u00a3211.96, and on iStorage's own site for \u00a3209. \nIf you are able to get one, however, the diskAshur Pro is unparalleled in both its physical and internal protection, and the compact build and hard-wearing design make this a must-have for the security-conscious. \nA majorly fast, and simple to use, compact mobile Wi-Fi hotspot Slim yet tough design", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "aukey powerbank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:31:00.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d5fea10addd33e827a2a66171f667b7ed79e04b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3TbQtW9hqeTgwyCeGXFvyl6cVfQCBq45.8fIG00MTLJP5jGd5UwMGzkPLJXMPFGZhd9cm_eV9N0tbnG61Tewqe1LzPK0t6OG0", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - All the latest technology news", "title": "Multiplayer support has been restored to Star Wars Battlefront 2", "title_full": "Multiplayer support has been restored to Star Wars Battlefront 2", "published": "2017-10-03T13:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uWnxWP8MUgu2MqUFjqvXAC-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 44, "comments": 0, "shares": 44}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d5fea10addd33e827a2a66171f667b7ed79e04b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3TbQtW9hqeTgwyCeGXFvyl6cVfQCBq45.8fIG00MTLJP5jGd5UwMGzkPLJXMPFGZhd9cm_eV9N0tbnG61Tewqe1LzPK0t6OG0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emma Boyle", "published": "2017-10-03T13:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Multiplayer support has been restored to Star Wars Battlefront 2", "text": "Multiplayer support has been restored to Star Wars Battlefront 2 Multiplayer support has been restored to Star Wars Battlefront 2 The 2005 one, not the unreleased one Shares \nThere\u2019s a Star Wars Battlefront been drawn between two Star Wars Battlefronts \u2013 just ahead of the launch of the open beta for EA\u2019s upcoming Star Wars Battlefront 2 , Disney has restored multiplayer support to the 2005 Star Wars Battlefront 2. \nCreated by Pandemic, the 2005 version of Star Wars Battlefront 2 saw its multiplayer closed down back in 2014 alongside the GameSpy multiplayer service. \nGiven that EA was planning to release its own Star Wars Battlefront game for consoles and PC the following year this was perhaps something of a relief to the publisher.

This feature can be found in the events section of your main PS4 menu and allows you to put together teams (up to 60 of them) to compete for prizes and status. \nAt the moment the only games which support Team Tournaments are Uncharted 4, Uncharted: Lost Legacy, World of Tanks and Mantis Burn Racing. However, PlayStation has said more titles will be added soon. \nAs detailed in the leak and beta release , there are also some new follower, messaging, privacy and family safety features to explore. \nTo be honest, though, the most convenient change is the ability to turn off pop up notifications while you're watching video. That's the kind of focus on the entertainment experience we like to see. \nOriginal article continues below... \nThough we don\u2019t know when exactly it\u2019ll be it is inevitable that there\u2019s going to be a 5.0 firmware update for the PlayStation 4 and details of what changes it\u2019s going to bring have been leaked online. \nEurogamer , which claims to have secured a copy of the release notes, reports that 1080p 60 fps streaming via Twitch will be supported for PS4 Pro owners in this new update. This adds another 1080p exclusive to the Pro, which already supports 1080p Remote and Share Play. \nAnother big change, for all PS4 owners rather than just Pro owners, is that it\u2019ll be possible to follow any user account and not just verified and official accounts. \nThis brings PlayStation\u2019s following system more in line with the Xbox One\u2019s and Sony say the decision has been made to \u201cencourage more sharing of content and more interactions\u201d among users and \u201cboost the viral potential of UGC\u201d for developers. Share and share alike \nOf course, allowing players to interact with anyone means privacy controls will have to be improved. As a result it\u2019ll be also possible for players to decide if they want anyone to be able to follow them or whether they want the option to only be available to their existing friends. It\u2019ll also be possible to block users entirely. \nContinuing on the theme of increased security, changes will also be made to the console\u2019s account system. Now if you have sub or child accounts on your main console you\u2019ll be able to create a family account in which adult accounts will be able to act in a parent/guardian role and set parental controls on an account-by-account basis. \nThat means if you have children of a wide range of ages with accounts on the same console you can appropriately tailor their communication, content and spending permissions. \nA new web application will also be released to manage these family accounts, meaning you won\u2019t have to be on the console itself to access the parental controls and will be able to do so from your PC or smartphone. \nFinally, there\u2019ll be a multitude of smaller changes such as making system notifications and upload/download statuses visible from the Quick Menu so you don\u2019t need to trek back to your Home screen when you want to check on them. \nAs well as these push notifications for events will be introduced, spectator comments will appear on screen when broadcasting in VR mode and there\u2019ll be support for 7 more languages. \nAt the moment, Sony hasn\u2019t confirmed these details or confirmed an official release date for the 5.0 firmware but Eurogamer reports that it\u2019ll be launched in the near future alongside an overhauled and improved Playstation App.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:16:40.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad89a8ab33523e73f0d363d04496012caf137287", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3RSAVqSV9wOYaiXniKGVmOM8QMnRtdYrW5LaYD7nbI6xSeDH73YbXAxQcahy_dGFQjU3JfT2cWHrxhdoz4Lx0G72bVn.qHElAufXn3autB8sHWGeQemWmwQ--", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://techradar.com//rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - All the latest technology news", "title": "Evidence mounts for Google Home Mini as it makes appearance in the Home app", "title_full": "Evidence mounts for Google Home Mini as it makes appearance in the Home app", "published": "2017-10-03T17:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XveKRDLRzwm5CciVurNcuC-1200-80.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 18, "comments": 0, "shares": 18}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad89a8ab33523e73f0d363d04496012caf137287", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3RSAVqSV9wOYaiXniKGVmOM8QMnRtdYrW5LaYD7nbI6xSeDH73YbXAxQcahy_dGFQjU3JfT2cWHrxhdoz4Lx0G72bVn.qHElAufXn3autB8sHWGeQemWmwQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jon Porter", "published": "2017-10-03T17:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Evidence mounts for Google Home Mini as it makes appearance in the Home app", "text": "Evidence mounts for Google Home Mini as it makes appearance in the Home app Evidence mounts for Google Home Mini as it makes appearance in the Home app A mini Home Shares \nEvidence is mounting that we're about to see the announcement of the Google Home Mini, a smaller version of the Google Home smart speaker similar to Amazon's Echo Dot . \nThis leak comes courtesy of someone who lives near Google's campus in Silicon Valley, who discovered that the device was available for setup in their Google Home app . \nThis suggests a neighbor had a Google Home Mini (possibly because they work for Google themselves), which during its setup phase anyone within range was briefly able to connect to. @ArtemR Google Home Mini confirmed. #lol cc @jasonhowell @ronxo @Ohthatflo pic.twitter.com/GpmgDk0T5T October 2, 2017 A Mini adventure \nThe Google Home Mini's existence was first suggested two weeks ago when Droid Life obtained leaked images. \nThese images suggested the speaker would be available in chalk, charcoal or coral colors, and would be priced at a budget-friendly $49 (about \u00a340 / AU$60) compared to the Google Home's premium $129 (\u00a3129 / about AU$170) price point. \nWithout official confirmation we don't yet know when the smart speaker will make an appearance, but we're expecting to see the device make an appearance at tomorrow's Google Pixel 2 launch event .

Controversy Shares \nWhy offer crowd-pleasing phones when you can introduce crowd-splitting ones? Smartphones that are divisive in design or feature set, drawing people intensely toward or away from it with an air of \u201cwe know better what you want than you do.\u201d \nFor an industry where the companies that play it safe run the risk of immediately blending in, this divisiveness has become a secret weapon that\u2019s most valuable in attaining. And that\u2019s exactly what the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL are attempting to do. \nCase in point: Last year, Google was quick to point out that its debut smartphone had what Apple\u2019s seventh generation device didn\u2019t: a headphone jack. Conversely, of the things that the iPhone 7 had that the Pixel didn\u2019t: waterproofing, headphones included in the box, and on the iPhone 7 Plus , a dual-lens camera. \nMore importantly, the iPhone of the time had an imperceivable quality that Google\u2019s formula lacked: controversy. The huge stir created by Apple\u2019s seemingly small, but radical feature shift away from the trusty 3.5mm jack got people talking, even if a lot of the talk wasn\u2019t always positive. \nNow, a year later, the Google Pixel 2 (based on often-repeating rumors) seems to reflect Apple\u2019s 2016 moves. The latest Google phone will reportedly be waterproof and ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack. And based on the community\u2019s response to these changes, aiming to achieve a similar whiff of controversy is working. A look at the Pixel 2's possibly final design (Credit: Evan Blass) Finding the balance \nI\u2019ve seen people swearing off Google\u2019s new phone even before it releases and to be honest, I understand the frustration. As someone who uses the Google Pixel XL as my daily driver, I\u2019m not a fan of the idea that Google may be stripping away features in its search of a spark. \nControversy is exciting, even for those who aren\u2019t partaking in the purchase of a new smartphone. But as we\u2019ve seen with Apple\u2019s lineup, which has now moved into the iPhone 8 and iPhone X , the shock-factor fades after some time. People who were torn on a missing headphone port are still torn, while everyone else has bought AirPods. \nHowever, Google\u2019s big changes aren\u2019t really that shocking. That\u2019s because, as we\u2019ve written about at length, the Pixel 2\u2019s removal of the headphone jack actually makes at least some lick of sense. Equipped with Android Oreo and its knack for high-quality wireless codecs , this push could carve out a much-needed pocket of the market dedicated to affordable, audiophile-grade (or close to it) wireless headphones. \nAnother example sees Sony\u2019s donation of its proprietary LDAC codec in Android Oreo as a strong indication that Google\u2019s and its partners\u2019 are committed to going hard on wireless. \nIt instills confidence in a business decision unlike Apple\u2019s meager claim of \u201ccourage\u201d in removing the headphone jack. \nIf the Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL arrive as we suspect, I\u2019ll certainly be happy about the waterproofing measures, but less so about the lack of a headphone jack. I live and breathe music, and in their current state, the wireless listening experience in New York City is frequently interrupted by the myriad signals bouncing all around. It\u2019s a nightmare. \nThat said, I still plan on picking one up. Why? Because I want to see how the wireless headphone market adapts, and also because the Pixel has arguably the best smartphone camera in the market. I trust its sensor to pick up every last detail beautifully, going as far as using it as a dedicated camera replacement. And the camera alone will make the Pixel 2 worth it to me. \nWhen it comes time for Google\u2019s big announcement, I think it\u2019s okay to be skeptical by these changes. But personally, you can take my wired headphones. Just give me the best camera around and I\u2019ll be happy.

Every year, price tags are routinely shredded as major retailers, e-tailers and AV specialists mark down stock as manufacturers cut deals to shift boxes. Wherever you look there will be cheap, cheap, cheap TVs. \nBut what separates a great TV deal from a turkey, and exactly what features are worth holding out for? \nWe don\u2019t need a crystal ball to predict that your next TV will be a 4K UHD model, given that most screen makers have migrated lock, stock and barrel to 2160p panels. But there could still be deals on Full HD models that will pique your interest (more on this down the page). How many HDMIs? \nAlways read the small print before you flash the plastic. The first thing buyers should check is how many HDMI inputs a set offers. We reckon three is a minimum these days, unless you\u2019re partnering with an AV receiver. After that, double-check that the inputs are HDCP 2.2 compliant. If they\u2019re not, you\u2019ll have problems hooking up a UHD Blu-ray player, UHD set top box or 4K media player. Try and get a set with at least 3 HDCP 2.2 compliant HDMI ports. \nOf course, not all 4K sets are equal. Newer models will offer HDR support too. On lower priced screens, this will cover the basic (ie common) HDR10 standard. Don\u2019t however expect any bargain priced HDR set to perform like your mate\u2019s top-end telly. Low cost, edge-lit LCD HDR screens are usually no brighter than Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) models - typically 350 cd/m2 (or nits). \nNetwork connectivity is a given on any 4K TV these days, although smart platforms vary dramatically between brands. They can be elegant (like LG\u2019s webOS and Panasonic\u2019s Firefox-based OS) or a little less so (Android TV). The streaming apps themselves also warrant close scrutiny before you buy. Check out our guide to the best smart TVs for a rundown of how each OS performs To stream 4K or not to stream 4K... \nFor example, while a Smart TV might be 4K, you should still check that the Netflix and Amazon Video apps actually support 4K streams. And what about streaming HDR? It\u2019s common to find HDR capable Netflix clients on TVs, but HDR-enabled Amazon less so. 4K YouTube is even more unpredictable. Look for support for the YouTube VP9 codec on packaging or literature to be sure the YouTube implementation will support ultra HD content. Dolby Vision support has arrived on streaming services, but only a few TVs support the HDR standard. \nBut don\u2019t let apps be a deal breaker. It\u2019s easy enough to add a 4K media streamer, like the Amazon Fire TV box (also certain to get a Black Friday price cut) or Apple TV 4K . \nThere are various types of Black Friday TV deal to be had. Manufacturers negotiate to promote/push/dump stock at prices which can (infamously) lead to brawls in-store; they benefit from moving high volumes on screen sizes or models that have floundered. But there are also bargains to be had on last season models, or screens that simply need to be shifted to make way for direct replacements. It\u2019s here the informed buyer can make big savings. The LG E6 might be a year old, but it still looks stunning thanks to its 4K HDR OLED display. Best buy OLED... \nLG\u2019s 2017 OLED range, those with a 7 suffix, are amongst the best TVs it\u2019s ever made. But its 2016 OLEDs, the \u20186\u2019 models, were pretty tasty too, and it\u2019s worth looking out for Black Friday clearances on remaining stock. \nThe 65-inch OLED65E6 in particular is still an impressive TV. With its unfeasibly thin picture-on-glass design and Harman/Kardon soundbar, it\u2019s definitely cutting edge. The set boasts four HDCP 2.2 compliant HDMIs, and a full complement of catch-up services, including BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, Netflix, Amazon and Now TV. \nImage quality on this Ultra HD premium model is superb. It supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision, and if you still have a hankering for 3D there\u2019s passive 3D support and Dual Play goggles for split-screen gaming. Sony's ZD9 might be due for an upgrade, but it's still one of the best looking sets around. Sony super savers \nIt\u2019s also worth looking out for savings on Sony\u2019s KD-65ZD9 / XBR65X930E 4K HDR TV. This set may be into its second year now, and is almost certainly destined for replacement come CES 2018, but it remains one of the best performing HDR TVs we\u2019ve ever seen, capable of superbly bright spectral highlights, profound black level and sensational colour depth. \nKey to its prowess image is Sony\u2019s radical Master Backlight Drive technology which employs controllable LEDs, able to glow at peak intensity with astonishing precision. The ZD9 also uses Sony\u2019s top of the line image processor, the X1 Extreme, as seen on the highly rated A1 OLED model. \nBargain hunters are also advised to check if retailers discounting Sony\u2019s hybrid Full HD HDR sets. These come in four flavours, starting at just 32-inches. The WE75 is available in 43- and 49-inch screen sizes, boasts a smart aluminium bezel and wide colour gamut Triluminos panel. Sitting beneath it are WE66 (49- and 40-inches), WE61 (32-inch only) and RE45 (40-inch, with no internet connectivity) models. Samsung on the cheap \nExpect tempting price reductions on select Samsung 2017 models for Black Friday too, as these sets originally landed with pretty hefty tickets. Likely super savers will be the mid-range Q7 line, and the 6 Series. \nBoth 2160p ranges are HDR enabled, and have impressive specs. The QE55Q7F / QN55Q7FAM is the brand\u2019s entry-level QLED model, and boasts high brightest HDR and a wide colour gamut. It\u2019s available in both flat and curved variants. The latter carries a significant price premium, but could well be a bargain buy on Black Friday. Like all Samsung top-end tellies, it uses a One Connect junction box, which offers easy access and the potential of an HDMI upgrade if you need it. Samsung's 6 series offer great color performance at affordable prices. \nIf a mainstream Samsung LED LCD fits the bill, watch for price cuts on the brand\u2019s 6 Series models. Its MU6120/MU6300 4K ranges are HDR enabled and use Active Crystal Colour/4K Color Drive technology to really make colours pop. Design wise they\u2019re top notch too, with a thin bezel and stylised pedestal. Look for key reductions on the 40- to 50-inch screens. Hot deal Hitachis (UK only) \nFinally, expect hot deals on Hitachi TVs. The brand distributes through UK-retailer Argos, which has a reputation for heavy discounts.

But I wanted more. \nThankfully, more came. Apple launched Apple Pay, followed swiftly by Android Pay, allowing me to pay for groceries, train tickets and a pint down the pub with my smartphone. It was the future. And then the future arrived on my wrist as smartwatches began to offer the same technology. \nI was nerd-gaseming left, right and center and the lady at Gregg's* was left starstruck as I proudly presented my Apple Watch to the payment terminal. \n'But John, what on earth has this got to do with a car that you're not even paying with?\u2019 I hear you cry. \nWell reader, you're about to be rewarded with the answer. (I know the headline gave it away, just play along will you. Thanks.) OMG! \nEngine : 1.3 liter, 3 cylinder Power output : 110bhp Price : \u00a318,490 \nYep, now the humble car key has entered the contactless payment arena. \nAvailable for a limited time only on the Connected Chic trim of the DS 3, the neat little key gives no indication of its payment prowess. \nThere are a trio of buttons to unlock and lock the car as well as to access the trunk. It's a little chunkier and heavier perhaps than most keys, but still easily pocketable. \nIt's not a direct replacement for your debit or credit card, as you top it up with money via the BarclayCard bPay app on your smartphone (you can use any UK debit or credit card to top up), rather than it establishing a direct link with your bank. \nYou can put a maximum of \u00a3200 (around $260, AU$340) on the key, and it's accepted anywhere with contactless payment support. \nIt's first trial was at a pub, and as our server approached with the bill I casually said 'can I pay by contactless?\u2019 \nYes, was the reply and my eyes lit up. I had to ask for the bill to be split, as in the UK each contactless payment is capped at \u00a330 (similar limits are in place in other countries) which raised suspicions, but this was only the start. \n\u201cWhat's that you're paying with?\u201d our server enquired as I reached for the key, to which I smugly replied \u201cmy car key\u201d and held it to the terminal. \nNothing... Uh oh. Make sure you line up the disc with the payment machine Location, location, location \nMy heart stopped for a second. Had the key not been topped up? Was it broken? Was it all a big ruse by DS with a Z-list celeb ready to appear behind me and point out the hidden cameras while laughing in my face? \n\"HA! This technology journalist actually thought he could use his car key to pay for food!\" they'd laugh as their teeth glittered like C-beams near the Tannh\u00e4user Gate , \"What a MORON!\" \nThankfully, it was none of the above. I was just doing it wrong. Turns out the contactless part of the key is the shiny black disc at the top, and not the body with buttons. \nA subtle movement of the wrist and I got the approval beep from the machine. Relief, and I'll admit, a fair amount of snugness washed over me. \n\u201cOh my god, that's so cool, I'm telling everyone!\u201d And that's exactly what they did. \nIt then prompted our server to say, and do something remarkable\u2026\u201cOh my god, that's so cool, I'm telling everyone!\u201d \nAnd that's exactly what they did. As we made our way through the dining room towards the exit we watched as our server rushed from colleague to colleague, excitedly gesturing in our direction, explaining our 'magic key\u2019 - sometimes it's the simplest things that are the most satisfying. \nIt wasn't just the reaction of that one person either. Every single time I used the key to pay, the person on the other side of the counter would ask what I was using and then voice their approval of the technology, from the local store to the football ground. \nEveryone was impressed, and wanted their car key to do the same. Such a simple technology, but one that really connected with people. Success! But what about the car? \nThe key is great, but what about the car it activates? Well actually, it's rather good too. \nIt may only be a little hatchback, but it has a surprisingly punchy 1.3 liter, three cylinder engine that gets you away from junctions, and up the gears on the motorway with relative ease. \nThe seats are comfortable, cabin spacious enough and the infotainment supports Android Auto along with DS\u2019s own navigation system. \nThe controls around the wheel and below the screen are a little clunky, which slightly detracts from the experience, but with the DS 3 Connected Chic starting at \u00a317,395 (around $23,000, AU$29,000) it\u2019s acceptable. \nDS 3 Connected Chic gallery Image 1 of 10 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gregg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barclaycard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tannh\u00e4user gate", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:48:44.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f28d75248f61ccdedc9b593e4ffa70ac04db4097", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3t1qWoE_hgr7azHC7foNcwIHrpqeZ.nySYeVwxbURjMlFXB6vFY3SWzMU.fsdGvj7il2Z9JvQxH7ZvEktQyLyjRfKH.n.JSNJ3GDbSGLVRmQ-", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://technewsblogs.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "Tech News Blogs", "title": "The National Theatre is using augmented reality to enhance its shows", "title_full": "The National Theatre is using augmented reality to enhance its shows", "published": "2017-10-03T19:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://technewsblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/w3N26Y6Fis6WL7ZDstdcYE-1000x600.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 248}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f28d75248f61ccdedc9b593e4ffa70ac04db4097", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3t1qWoE_hgr7azHC7foNcwIHrpqeZ.nySYeVwxbURjMlFXB6vFY3SWzMU.fsdGvj7il2Z9JvQxH7ZvEktQyLyjRfKH.n.JSNJ3GDbSGLVRmQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nobseellace", "published": "2017-10-03T19:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "The National Theatre is using augmented reality to enhance its shows", "text": "Email \nNow that it\u2019s being effectively integrated into our mobile phones, augmented reality technology is really starting to take off. Where Google Glass managed to make AR experiences seem inaccessible with limited applications and maximum privacy concerns, simple AR apps like Pokemon Go and Snapchat have brought down consumer walls and made us see the fun side of the technology. \nNow that ARKit has launched on iOS 11 and Apple has effectively created a huge platform for AR on the iPhone overnight we can only see it expanding in terms of depth and breadth. \nRecently TechRadar got the chance to experience one of the really exciting directions augmented reality is taking right now. Fairly soon, augmented reality is going to be known for so much more than bringing Pokemon into the real world or changing our faces in real-time with animated lenses. Live and legible \nThe National Theatre is using augmented reality technology to improve accessibility in its live performances as part of a collaboration with Epson and Accenture. \nUsing Epson\u2019s latest Moverio BT-350 Smart Glasses, Accenture has created a new augmented reality system called Open Access Smart Capture which makes it possible for theater-goers to view real-time subtitling during live performances. \nWe tried the glasses out for ourselves during a short demo session. During the demo, actresses Olivia Coleman and Olivia Williams performed a scene from the play Mosquito on a makeshift stage. While they performed their words appeared on the lenses of the glasses, overlaying the real world without blocking it out. \nThere are already accessible National Theatre performances which have subtitles on screens at the side of the stage. However, these performances are at limited times \u2013 there are only four captioned performances and up to only three audio-described performances per production run. Related with Best business mobiles in the UK for 2017: top smartphones for work \nOpen Access Smart Capture will make it possible for the hearing-impaired to attend any National Theatre performance they like, sit in any seat they please and keep their focus more on the on-stage performance rather than the screen off to the side. Front and center \nAccenture\u2019s software offers a surprising degree of customizability. Before the show started, we were able to choose the size, color, and placement of the subtitles as well as whether they remained stable or scrolled. \nThis could all be done using a small touchpad attached to the glasses and although we settled on what we wanted before the performance started, it\u2019s completely possible to change any of your settings as the show is happening. \nThough the glasses weren\u2019t so lightweight we forgot they were on our face, they were far from uncomfortable and wearing them was no more annoying than wearing 3D glasses in a cinema. \nNaturally, there are limitations but it appears they\u2019re being actively worked on. Being live, theater is known for not always going according to plan and what\u2019s written on the script isn\u2019t always going to be exactly what appears on stage. \nFortunately, through a combination of preparation during the rehearsal process (making it possible to program sequences of events), the software\u2019s ability to watch and listen to the performance in real time and adapt as necessary, and the fact that a human can monitor and change things during the show in real-time, everything is likely to go smoothly. The aim is to achieve 97% accuracy when it comes to timing of captions and descriptions. Related with Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 8: Do I buy Samsung now, or wait for Apple? Sticking to the script \nFor example, if the stage background is due to change color to white during the performance, the software can be programmed to make sure the subtitles that are appearing aren\u2019t also in white so they remain legible. However, it can also recognize if this change happens earlier or later than planned and adapt as necessary. \nIt\u2019s also possible for the viewer to interfere themselves, though, which is especially convenient given color blindness has the potential to make certain color combinations problematic for individual viewers. \nAnother potential problem is, of course, battery life. When we asked an Accenture representative how long the glasses could be used on a full charge he told us around two and a half hours. Though this could get through many National Theatre productions, in some cases it could be cutting it fine. \nThis relatively short battery life would be especially problematic if there was a rush to move the glasses between theatres for matinee and evening performances. \nA solution could be to tether the headsets to the seats or have longer intermissions to allow for slightly more charge time but we\u2019d hope the battery technology in the headsets will eventually be improved to make wearing them as free and seamless an experience as possible. \nAfter starting the partnership at the beginning of 2017, the equipment and software is now entering its pilot phase. Over the next year it will be tested during real National Theatre performances in three of its theaters. \nThe hope is that after extensive testing the glasses will be rolled out to all National Theatre performances by October 2018. After this, it\u2019ll then be opened up as a possibility for other theaters of all sizes up and down the country. \nWhen we asked representatives at the event whether the glasses and software could be rolled out for a wider number of applications such as cinemas or museums they agreed that in the future this is certainly a possibility. Future plans \nApplications like this make it clear why many state that augmented reality has a much wider appeal than virtual reality. A theater filled with people watching something on closed off virtual reality headsets just wouldn\u2019t have the same atmosphere or sense of being connected with what was happening that these augmented reality headsets made possible. \nWith Epson\u2019s glasses we still felt connected to the real world and the rest of the audience around us while we were enjoying a completely personalized viewing experience. It truly does augment the real world and it proves that ancient arts such as theater can actually be opened up to more people and given a wider appeal by new technology rather than destroyed by it.

Shares \nGoogle is set to announce two new handsets on October 4 at an event in California, and we expect them to be called the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL . \nThese are follow up handsets to the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL , and we can expect these to have some similar features, but the rumors suggest there will be some key differences between the two phones. \nThe exact release date for the phones is currently unclear, but one report has suggested the Pixel 2 will be on sale October 19, but you'll have to wait until November 15 to buy the larger phone. \nEverything here is based on rumors so far, but we'll be reporting live on the launch of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL on October 4 so be sure to check back here then for the official news. How to watch the Google Pixel 2 launch Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL design \nIf you know the original Pixel and Pixel XL well, you won't be particularly surprised by the design we've seen for the two new phones. \nThe Pixel 2 will be smaller than the Pixel 2 XL, but the two-toned design of the rear on the two phones looks rather similar. That said, the front is said to differ quite a bit for the smaller option, with the front having thick bezels like before, while the Pixel 2 XL will have slimmer bezels to fit with its rumored 18:9 aspect ratio. \nColors may differ a little with both phones rumored to launch in \"Just Black\", \"Black and White\" but the smaller phone looks to be the only phone coming in \"Kinda Blue\", which you can see below on the right. Left: Black & White Pixel 2 XL, Right: Kinda Blue Pixel 2 (Source: DroidLife) \nThe rumors heavily suggest both phones will not have 3.5mm headphone jacks, while some rumors have suggested that is specifically to allow for it to be waterproof unlike the original Pixel. \nWe also expect both models to come with dual front-facing stereo speakers, which should make for some top-notch quality audio when you're watching videos on either version of the phone. Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL display \nScreen is going to be one of the big differing factors for the Pixel 2. One of the biggest leaks we've seen so far has suggested the smaller Pixel 2 will come with a 4.97-inch screen with a Full HD resolution. \nThat's likely set to be OLED tech and come with a traditional 16:9 ratio, unlike a lot of phones we've seen this year. All of that seems quite certain, while the Pixel 2 XL screen spec is a little less clear. \nOne leak suggested the Pixel 2 XL will come with a 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display that would give it a far better resolution than the smaller version of the phone. \nAnother rumor though has suggested the screen will actually be 5.6-inches and have a ratio of 18:9 with a resolution of 2560 x 1312, which would make it look similar to the LG G6 or Samsung Galaxy S8. \nOn top of that, another rumor suggests the Pixel 2 XL may launch with a 6-inch AMOLED display with a very, very thin bezel, so right now what will happen on the larger phone isn't clear at all. \nAll we know is it's likely the Pixel 2 XL will have a far bigger and more vibrant screen than the smaller Pixel phone. Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL OS and power \nThe new Google Pixel phones are almost certain to be launching with the latest Android Oreo software on board and ready to roll. It'll be in a stock capacity and work in a very similar way to how we've seen it on the older Pixel devices. \nWhen it comes to power, both phones will likely be running the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset that performs particularly well on a series of flagship phones we've already seen launch this year. \nIt looks like there will be a 4GB of RAM version of both phones, but there may be a different version with 3GB or 6GB of RAM too. Storage wise we're expecting to see both phones launch with 64GB or 128GB of internal memory. Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL camera and battery \nCamera wise, the rumors suggest the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will both feature the same shooter setup. It looks like it'll have a 13MP camera on the rear, but it won't be a dual sensor shooter. \nInstead the single sensor will be very large - as large as the fingerprint sensor itself - that should allow for lots of light and hopefully should mean great photography in poor lighting. \nOn the front we're expecting a 7MP camera for selfies on both phones, which is down a little from the 8MP sensor on the first phone. Low-light is expected to be much more improved on the rear camera and there may be optical image stabilization on both the front and rear shooters too. \nBattery will be a big difference between the two phones too. One source claimed the Pixel 2 would come with a 2,700mAh battery while another leak suggests the Pixel 2 XL will have a 3,520mAh cell. \nThat heavily suggests the battery will be much better on the Pixel 2 XL, but we won't know for certain until we get the phones to review in the coming weeks. Whether wireless charging or fast-charging tech will be available is currently unclear too. Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL price \nNeither of these phones are going to be cheap. The original Pixel was $649 (\u00a3599, AU$1,079) at launch, but one source has claimed the larger of the phones will be a touch more expensive than last time. \nThe Pixel XL was $769 (\u00a3719, AU$1,269) and that source claims it'll be an extra $200 than the new model so we can expect it to jump up to at least $800 (\u00a3800, AU$1,200). Takeaway \nIt looks like the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will have a much more pronounced difference compared to the relationship between the original Pixel and Pixel XL. \nThe Pixel 2 XL looks to be the far more exciting phone that will come with top-end specs, but it also looks to have a much higher price tag. \nYour buying decision will likely come down to how good you want the battery life to be, how large you want your screen to be and how much you're willing to spend on your new phone from Google.

Where Google Glass managed to make AR experiences seem inaccessible with limited applications and maximum privacy concerns, simple AR apps like Pokemon Go and Snapchat have brought down consumer walls and made us see the fun side of the technology. \nNow that ARKit has launched on iOS 11 and Apple has effectively created a huge platform for AR on the iPhone overnight we can only see it expanding in terms of depth and breadth. \nRecently TechRadar got the chance to experience one of the really exciting directions augmented reality is taking right now. Fairly soon, augmented reality is going to be known for so much more than bringing Pokemon into the real world or changing our faces in real-time with animated lenses. Live and legible \nThe National Theatre is using augmented reality technology to improve accessibility in its live performances as part of a collaboration with Epson and Accenture. \nUsing Epson\u2019s latest Moverio BT-350 Smart Glasses, Accenture has created a new augmented reality system called Open Access Smart Capture which makes it possible for theater-goers to view real-time subtitling during live performances. \nWe tried the glasses out for ourselves during a short demo session. During the demo, actresses Olivia Coleman and Olivia Williams performed a scene from the play Mosquito on a makeshift stage. While they performed their words appeared on the lenses of the glasses, overlaying the real world without blocking it out. \nThere are already accessible National Theatre performances which have subtitles on screens at the side of the stage. However, these performances are at limited times \u2013 there are only four captioned performances and up to only three audio-described performances per production run. \nOpen Access Smart Capture will make it possible for the hearing-impaired to attend any National Theatre performance they like, sit in any seat they please and keep their focus more on the on-stage performance rather than the screen off to the side. Front and center \nAccenture\u2019s software offers a surprising degree of customizability. Before the show started, we were able to choose the size, color, and placement of the subtitles as well as whether they remained stable or scrolled. \nThis could all be done using a small touchpad attached to the glasses and although we settled on what we wanted before the performance started, it\u2019s completely possible to change any of your settings as the show is happening. \nThough the glasses weren\u2019t so lightweight we forgot they were on our face, they were far from uncomfortable and wearing them was no more annoying than wearing 3D glasses in a cinema. \nNaturally, there are limitations but it appears they\u2019re being actively worked on. Being live, theater is known for not always going according to plan and what\u2019s written on the script isn\u2019t always going to be exactly what appears on stage. \nFortunately, through a combination of preparation during the rehearsal process (making it possible to program sequences of events), the software\u2019s ability to watch and listen to the performance in real time and adapt as necessary, and the fact that a human can monitor and change things during the show in real-time, everything is likely to go smoothly. The aim is to achieve 97% accuracy when it comes to timing of captions and descriptions. Sticking to the script \nFor example, if the stage background is due to change color to white during the performance, the software can be programmed to make sure the subtitles that are appearing aren\u2019t also in white so they remain legible. However, it can also recognize if this change happens earlier or later than planned and adapt as necessary. \nIt\u2019s also possible for the viewer to interfere themselves, though, which is especially convenient given color blindness has the potential to make certain color combinations problematic for individual viewers. \nAnother potential problem is, of course, battery life. When we asked an Accenture representative how long the glasses could be used on a full charge he told us around two and a half hours. Though this could get through many National Theatre productions, in some cases it could be cutting it fine. \nThis relatively short battery life would be especially problematic if there was a rush to move the glasses between theatres for matinee and evening performances. \nA solution could be to tether the headsets to the seats or have longer intermissions to allow for slightly more charge time but we\u2019d hope the battery technology in the headsets will eventually be improved to make wearing them as free and seamless an experience as possible. \nAfter starting the partnership at the beginning of 2017, the equipment and software is now entering its pilot phase. Over the next year it will be tested during real National Theatre performances in three of its theaters. \nThe hope is that after extensive testing the glasses will be rolled out to all National Theatre performances by October 2018. After this, it\u2019ll then be opened up as a possibility for other theaters of all sizes up and down the country. \nWhen we asked representatives at the event whether the glasses and software could be rolled out for a wider number of applications such as cinemas or museums they agreed that in the future this is certainly a possibility. Future plans \nApplications like this make it clear why many state that augmented reality has a much wider appeal than virtual reality. A theater filled with people watching something on closed off virtual reality headsets just wouldn\u2019t have the same atmosphere or sense of being connected with what was happening that these augmented reality headsets made possible. \nWith Epson\u2019s glasses we still felt connected to the real world and the rest of the audience around us while we were enjoying a completely personalized viewing experience. It truly does augment the real world and it proves that ancient arts such as theater can actually be opened up to more people and given a wider appeal by new technology rather than destroyed by it.

You take at least 20 seconds looking at each piece, then your subconscious response is fed back to the iPad . \nThe art was great, and I had a lovely time wandering around looking at it all. I was a little self conscious knowing there was a man stood a couple of meters away looking at readings of how my brain was reacting, but it was a very nice way to spend a part of my morning. \nI particularly liked this piece that looked like a peaceful wooded scene, but was digitally created with lots of repetition, and on closer inspection each of the colors was labelled like a Painting by Numbers picture. On to the shopping! \nSo I finished looking at the art, my EEG was taken off, and my shopping list populated. Apparently I was most focused on the visual themes of the images rather than being creatively inspired by them, which I suppose is true, and has made me question the way I look at art. \nMy passion for the wooded picture populated an aroma diffuser, and my interest in another piece that was a world map painted across some speakers populated a drum kit and keyboard. \nIt obviously didn\u2019t pick up on the fact that I was looking at that piece because I was trying to figure out if the map had been drawn with geographic accuracy and was looking at the landmass of Africa versus my own tiny island. I know, I'm super cool. That's the speaker map in the back. \nThe shopping cart was interesting. It was full of musical instruments, cameras, skateboards, stylish interiors, and it felt like it painted a specific picture of a person. The only problem is, that person isn\u2019t me. It could be, and there\u2019s a part of me that would like to skateboard, play the drums, be a photographer, but I\u2019m not. \nBut maybe that\u2019s not the end of the world. We sat down for a chat with Ebay\u2019s Head of Personalization and Engagement, Bradford Shellhammer (yes that is his real name), to talk about how this experience will actually affect consumers at home. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s here is not affecting consumers. Thematically it lines up quite nicely with the work we\u2019re doing in the real world, but today was really just to get people to talk about shopping more thoughtfully, or more emotionally, or just not playing it safe.\u201d \nAnd that\u2019s the real point here. Many times during the morning we heard the phrase \u2018shop-y-cat\u2019 being thrown around, which as well as probably garnering its progenitor many pats on the back, refers to how most us probably shop. My subconscious shopping cart \nWe buy something because it\u2019s \u2018on trend\u2019 or because someone we know has one, or there\u2019s a recommendation. Ebay is clearly pushing for people to make more \u2018inspired\u2019 purchases. Which makes sense, as thinking outside the box is a must for a retailer that essentially sells anything within reason. \nThis experience does tie into something that Ebay has been working on since January, that as Shellhammer puts it: \u201c[Is about] showing you the thing that you\u2019re going to love, that you weren\u2019t looking for\u201d. \n\u201cMost personalization algorithms are focused on one thing: what have you done? Clicks on site, what you\u2019ve shopped for in the past, brands you\u2019ve had an affinity for. The next thing we\u2019re working on is more serendipitous recommendations.\u201d Smoke and mirrors? Would I buy a smoking mirror? \nThese serendipitous recommendations will be done by smarter collation of products, and allowing people to design their own Ebay. \u201cOur goal at the end of the day is to have our over 190 million customers across the globe each have their own Ebay store, rather than a one-size-fits-all system.\u201d \nShellhammer was easily the most charismatic person I\u2019ve ever met, so it was difficult not to get swept up in his utopian vision for the future of online shopping. And to be fair, he does know a bit about online shopping after having founded Fab.com and Bezar. \nMaybe this was all just a fancy, smoke and mirrors way of saying Ebay has really good personalization algorithms, but we certainly had a good morning and to be fair, if the task was to suggest things that I would like but wouldn\u2019t usually buy, it actually did a very good job.

Ebay is clearly pushing for people to make more \u2018inspired\u2019 purchases. Which makes sense, as thinking outside the box is a must for a retailer that essentially sells anything within reason. \nThis experience does tie into something that Ebay has been working on since January, that as Shellhammer puts it: \u201c[Is about] showing you the thing that you\u2019re going to love, that you weren\u2019t looking for\u201d. \n\u201cMost personalization algorithms are focused on one thing: what have you done? Clicks on site, what you\u2019ve shopped for in the past, brands you\u2019ve had an affinity for. The next thing we\u2019re working on is more serendipitous recommendations.\u201d Smoke and mirrors? Would I buy a smoking mirror? \nThese serendipitous recommendations will be done by smarter collation of products, and allowing people to design their own Ebay. \u201cOur goal at the end of the day is to have our over 190 million customers across the globe each have their own Ebay store, rather than a one-size-fits-all system.\u201d Related with Best power user Linux distros in 2017: 5 reviewed and rated \nShellhammer was easily the most charismatic person I\u2019ve ever met, so it was difficult not to get swept up in his utopian vision for the future of online shopping. And to be fair, he does know a bit about online shopping after having founded Fab.com and Bezar. \nMaybe this was all just a fancy, smoke and mirrors way of saying Ebay has really good personalization algorithms, but we certainly had a good morning and to be fair, if the task was to suggest things that I would like but wouldn\u2019t usually buy, it actually did a very good job.

This saying really rings true with me when I think about all of the memories that I\u2019ve captured with the Google Pixel XL since I started using it last year. \nAs my Google Photos library tells me, it has captured 1,870 moments (I know this seems low, but it\u2019s because the Pixel\u2019s camera usually got the perfect shot on the first try). This camera has been in my pocket, ready at the draw to take in the scene of the many once-in-a-lifetime occasions I experienced this year and of my cats in a silly or hilariously regal pose. And for both of them, I trusted it completely. \nSure, many smartphones probably could have done these moments justice. But as I sort through each of them, I\u2019m glad that it was the Google Pixel that captured them. While the phone itself is divisive, its camera is, even by today\u2019s standards, the Pixel\u2019s standout feature, and one that has me most looking forward to the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL . Here\u2019s why (and stay for a gallery of some cherished memories down below.) Specs rarely tell the entire story \nLooking at specs alone, the Pixel\u2019s cameras might not seem all that impressive. The front-facing selfie camera isn\u2019t pushing megapixel boundaries at 8MP and with an aperture of f/2.4, it shouldn\u2019t be as stellar at balancing light and color depth as it is. \nThe rear-facing camera is 12MP with a f/2.0 aperture, and those, too, aren\u2019t the best numbers for low-light photography or for scaling smoothly between portraits and landscape shots. For comparison, the new LG V30 has an f/1.6 value. But the results speak against this logic. \nThe Google Pixel\u2019s optics are at times far ahead of many smartphone sensors and while I\u2019m not a photography expert, it\u2019s easy to pin this spec-defying success on how tightly-knit the Pixel\u2019s camera software and hardware are. \nOf its many good qualities, like speedy autofocus and equally fast capture, perhaps my favorite is that the camera reliably shoots something that\u2019s very close to the actual scene. And for right now, that\u2019s exactly what I want: to remember things how they were, not how the camera thinks things should look. But of course, when Google Lens\u2019 artificial intelligence takes the wheel to crop out distractions is the foreground and improve night-time shooting, I\u2019ll gladly abide. \nIn 2016, Google touted its camera as being the best ever in a smartphone, and aside from many glowing personal stories like my own, its success has been noticed from within the smartphone industry. \nFiled under \u201cmore proof that specs don\u2019t mean everything\u201d, a staffer told us during a briefing for the Essential Phone that its modular 360-degree camera attachment utilizes the same sensor found inside of the Google Pixel. \nBut as we discovered in our review, this sensor put to use without the accompanying software \u2013 Google\u2019s secret sauce \u2013 isn\u2019t all that impressive. Looking at the results, it\u2019s pretty obvious that the software pulls at least half of the weight in the Pixel, and its absence is very noticeable. A bright future \nFor those who own the Google Pixel, you\u2019re in a real conundrum. The phone still has plenty of life left in it, but the one you probably want in your pocket next has some seriously large shoes to fill. So large that I think only the Google Pixel 2 can fill it. \nWhile leaked benchmarks don\u2019t speak to the Pixel 2\u2019s day-to-day camera performance, it\u2019s likely to have many improvements over the current model, such as the aforementioned Google Lens AI smarts, enhanced depth of field modes to stay on equal footage with its dual rear lens-packing competition, and optical image stabilization (OIS) to keep your videos smooth while in motion. Credit: VentureBeat \nConsidering that we haven\u2019t actually seen the rumored phone in the flesh, all we have to go off of are these leaked photos, like the one above. Look at the sensor, it\u2019s almost as large as the fingerprint reader. It\u2019s possible that, now, the specs will rival that of its competition, but with all of the delicious secret software sauce slathered on top. \nThe original Pixel changed my standards of just how good a smartphone lens can be and should be. And as such, my expectations for its successor are quite high. It will be tough to forgive Google for ditching the headphone jack of the Pixel 2, as it\u2019s rumored to do, but an awesome camera will be one of the few ways to smooth over the gap. \nHere's a look back on my year captured with the Google Pixel XL Image 1 of 45 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:20:04.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0278ba43bf08909ade17fa6f571394294764d95d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3RuwlObRIjxTFEWNWzgve6fVDFqxJvOn1", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/mobile-computing", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar: Mobile computing news", "title": "Google Pixelbook release date, price, news and rumors", "title_full": "Google Pixelbook release date, price, news and rumors", "published": "2017-10-03T23:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 88, "comments": 0, "shares": 88}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0278ba43bf08909ade17fa6f571394294764d95d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3RuwlObRIjxTFEWNWzgve6fVDFqxJvOn1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joe Osborne", "published": "2017-10-03T23:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Pixelbook release date, price, news and rumors", "text": "Google Pixelbook release date, price, news and features Google Pixelbook release date, price, news and features Google's next major Chromebook is here Shares \nAs expected Google dropped in a brand-new laptop during its Google Pixel 2 event on October 4 in San Francisco. It\u2019s called the Google Pixelbook, and as the rumors had it, it's not cheap . \nBut, why is this new device so exciting? Isn\u2019t it just another Chromebook? \nThe fact is, this is Google's first self-made Chrome OS device since it discontinued the Chromebook Pixel last summer . It's also the first Chromebook to offer full Google Play Store support for all mobile apps, and it works beautifully with an optional stylus accessory. \nSo, without further ado, here\u2019s everything you need to know about the Google Pixelbook \u2013 and be sure to check out our hands-on Google Pixelbook review . Cut to the chase What is Google Pixelbook? Google\u2019s flagship Chromebook When is Google Pixelbook out? October 31, 2017 What will Google Pixelbook cost? $999 \u2013 $1,649 or \u00a31,199 \u2013\u00a31,699 (no Australia price yet) Google Pixelbook price and release date \nWhile pre-orders for the Pixelbook opened today, units won't begin shipping until November 15. If you we're expecting those traditionally affordable Chromebook prices for the Pixelbook, prepare to be disappointed in this aspect also. \nThe Pixelbook starts at a whopping $999, or \u00a31,199, making it as expensive as an Apple MacBook or Microsoft Surface Laptop . Google is calling its latest Chrome OS product a high-performance Chromebook, and the specs back it up. At this price point you're getting a 7th generation Intel Core i5-powered model complete with 128GB of SSD storage. \nAt its highest configuration, the Pixelbook rings up for $1,649, or \u00a31,699, for an Intel Core i7 model with 512GB of SSD storage. \nOh, and if you want the Pixelbook Pen, the stylus costs extra at $99, or \u00a399. Google Pixelbook design \nWith a name like Pixelbook \u2013 and the many leaked images we saw \u2013 we expected Google's flagship Chromebook would take design cues from its flagship phones. \nSure enough, the Pixelbook has the same two-tone, glass-on-aluminum look of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL . Aesthetics aside, this is among the thinnest Chromebooks on the market measuring in at 10.3mm and weighing just 1.1 kilograms. \nGoogle also claims to have surpassed the traditional convertible laptop design with a 4-in-1 product. But, let's be real, it orients in all the same tablet, stand, tent and laptop modes of any hybrid laptop. Google Pixelbook screen \nLike the Chromebook Pixels before it, the Pixelbook features a 3:2 aspect ratio display, though, the screen is a little bit smaller at only 12.3-inches. The good news is that screen can now rotate a full 360-degrees, so you can use the Pixelbook as either a laptop or a tablet. Google Pixelbook specs \nThe latest Google Pixelbook houses more storage than any Chromebook from the company before, much less any Chrome OS device ever \u2013 period. \nSpecifically, the Pixelbook will come in three varieties: with either 128GB, 256GB or 512GB of flash storage inside. That base model of the Pixelbook offers twice as much flash storage as the previous Chromebook Pixel. \nThe Pixelbook also comes with equally beefy Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors. These aren't quad-core CPUs you'll find the Intel's latest 8th-generation Kaby Lake Refresh line, but they should offer more than enough power to drive your Android apps. Google Pixelbook features \nSpeaking of apps, the Google Pixelbook is the first Chromebook with full access to all the Android apps in the Google Play Store. That's right, you can finally use any Android app on the Pixelbook. \nWhat's more, Google Assistant comes baked into the Pixelbook, making typing things into your browser window almost seem antiquated. Users can summon the search company's virtual assistant simply by saying \"OK Google,\" Alternatively, the keyboard also has a dedicated Google Assistant key on the bottom row. \nLastly, the optional Pixelbook Pen aims to bring the device on par with other 2-in-1 tablets like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro . The stylus supports 60-degrees of angular awareness, 2,000 levels of pressure sensitivity and only 10 milliseconds of latency. \nIf the Pixelbook Pen is as good as it sounds, it might even 1up the Samsung Chromebook Pro .

A stunning reenactment of when I dropped the Pixel XL waist high \nThere's no bump and no border around the camera on this phone. It's all one piece of glass, unlike the mostly bump-free Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 . \nHere's where things are about to get different in the Google Pixel 2 series. \nThe two Google Pixel 2 phones appear to include an important protective border around their single-lens camera, according to the latest leaks. \nThe camera lens also appears to be masked by a separate piece of glass. There's less of a chance of similar spiderweb crack incident that gets worse over time. \nThe bump-free camera design seemed ideal when the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL launched 12 months ago. But it can lead to a gory ending, as pictured. \nWorse, when I first broke the Pixel XL, no one knew how to fix it. Repair shops all over town didn't have the parts to fix this unique piece of back glass. \nThe front glass? Sure, that's an easy and common repair service. But the back glass required replacing the entire back, including the aluminum and frame. \nI didn't take them up on that offer. It was too costly. So I'm left with a Pixel XL that's still good for Google Daydream View , but no longer the ideal camera. \nAs you can see from the link below, my colleague had a year to remember thanks to the Google Pixel's spec-defying camera. While I'm happy for him, I'm just going to keep sitting here with my broken, optically-useless Pixel XL until the Pixel 2 XL release date.

Is it virtual reality (VR), like the Oculus Rift, or it is more like augmented reality (AR), which Microsoft has already dabbled in with its HoloLens ? \nThe answer is that it\u2019s a bit of both \u2013 though far more like the former than the latter. \nMicrosoft\u2019s blended version of VR and AR is a new platform that's designed to immerse more users in the digital experience with lower-priced and less graphically-intensive headsets. To this end, the software maker has worked with leading computer manufacturers like Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo and Samsung to develop a more accessible head-mounted display (HMD) standard with a few ground rules. \nAs with high-end VR headsets, you wear a head-mounted display with two built-in screens to peer into a virtual world. And, as with VR, you can interact with your virtual world using handheld controllers \u2013 in this case pair of Microsoft-made motion controllers or an Xbox One controller. \nHowever, instead of HTC Vive Lighthouses, Oculus Waypoints or other infrared beacons tracking where you're looking and going, these headsets use integrated cameras to scan the surrounding environment. Mixed Reality headsets can also run at low-end graphical settings, enabling something as lightweight as an Ultrabook to generate a digital world for users. Cut to the chase What is Mixed Reality? Microsoft\u2019s blended VR/AR standard When is Mixed Reality out? October 17 What will Mixed Reality cost? Headsets start at $299 (about \u00a3225, AU$380) Windows Mixed Reality release date \nWindows Mixed Reality has been a top priority for Microsoft since last October , and the upcoming release of the Fall Creators Update on October 17 will cement Mixed Reality as a standard feature of Windows 10 . \nThis is when Windows 10 will officially add support for Mixed Reality headsets. As we mentioned above, the Fall Creators update is now available to download and install, so follow our guide if you want to experience Mixed Reality right now. Windows Mixed Reality price \nThe biggest differentiator between headsets for Windows Mixed Reality and those designed for VR is that the former can cost half as much. With prices for Mixed Reality headsets starting at $299 (about \u00a3225, AU$380), Microsoft\u2019s new platform competes more closely with mobile VR devices \u2013 like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream View \u2013 than with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. \nAdding motion controllers doesn't dramatically up the cost \u2013 a few manufacturers, like Acer, are bundling a complete headset package for $399 in the US. For a full price breakdown, let\u2019s look at all the headsets currently announced. \nAcer Windows Mixed Reality HMD \nAcer was one of the first companies to come out of the gate with a Windows Mixed Reality headset. It offers a display resolution of 1440 x 1440 per eye. Users can flip up the screen to quickly return to the real world \u2013 this is a regular feature of most, if not all, headsets in its class. Acer\u2019s headset is also among the cheapest, at $299 in the US on its own or $399 (about \u00a3300, AU$510) with a pair of wireless motion controllers. Pre-orders for this headset opened on October 3 and will begin shipping on October 17. \nDell Visor \nThe Dell Visor (and all Mixed Reality headsets, really) have a lot in common with Acer\u2019s, but we\u2019ll go over the specs nonetheless. It boasts two 2.89-inch, 1440 x 1440-resolution LCD displays that you can, once again, flip up for a quick exit from the virtual world. There are a few extra creature comforts in the shape of removable foam inserts, cable management loops and an easily adjustable headband for a comfy and tight fit. The Dell Visor is available to pre-order for $349 (about \u00a3260, AU$445) by itself, while you can add the controllers for an extra $99 (about \u00a375, AU$130). Units will begin shipping on October 17. \nHP Windows Mixed Reality Headset Developer Edition \nHP\u2019s take on the Windows 10 MR headset looks much more Tron-like than the others. It keeps up with its rivals thanks to a 2880 x 1440 combined resolution and 90Hz display, but its field of view is a narrower 95 degrees. HP\u2019s Mixed Reality headset is available now for $329 (about \u00a3250, AU$420) on its own and $449 (about \u00a3340, AU$570) bundled with motion controllers. \nLenovo Explorer \nThe Lenovo Explorer features all the same specs and comforts as the other Mixed Reality headsets. Its field of view also runs smack in the middle of the pack at 105 degrees. The good news is it\u2019s just as affordable as Acer\u2019s at $399 (about \u00a3300, AU$510) with motion controllers included. \nAsus Windows Mixed Reality Headset \nAsus differentiates its MR headset with a futuristic geometric front facade. Looks aside, it has all the same specs as its rivals, although its field of view is on the low side at 95 degrees. Asus has only revealed European pricing for its headset at \u20ac449, which means it\u2019ll cost about $530, \u00a3400 or AU$670. You can register now for pre-order info . \nSamsung HMD Odyssey \nThe Samsung HMD Odyssey is the latest Windows MR headset on the block, and it\u2019s both the most advanced as well as the most expensive device of its class. For starters, it packs larger 3.5-inch AMOLED displays for more vibrant, lifelike images. Built-in AKG headphones also add in the immersive soundscape of 360-degree spatial sound. Costing a cool $499 (about \u00a3377, AU$638) with controllers included, the Samsung HMD Odyssey will ship later than the other Windows Mixed Reality headsets, on November 6. Windows Mixed Reality requirements \nUnlike virtual reality, you won\u2019t need a killer rig to jump into virtual worlds. The minimum specs required for a Windows Mixed Reality PC are lightweight enough for most modern Ultrabooks to power a headset. \nAt the very least, you will need the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, coming October 17 , an Intel Core i5-7200U processor or better, 8GB of DDR3 dual channel RAM or better, 10GB of free disk space, an Intel HD Graphics 620 or DX12-capable GPU, and HDMI 1.4 or DisplayPort 1.2 as well as USB 3.0 Type-A or Type-C. \nKeep in mind that the above specs are only good enough for a 60-frames-per-second (fps) experience. To get to 90fps, Microsoft suggests a system specced with at least a desktop-grade Intel Core i5-4590 or AMD Ryzen 5 1400 3.4Ghz \u2013 or another quad-core processor. You'll also need a discreet GPU at least on the level of an Nvidia GTX 960.

Today's leak comes courtesy of Walmart , which happened to include an image of the Pixel 2 XL in a premature posting (and leak) for the Google Home Mini. \nThe new leak showed the Google Pixel 2 XL running the Google Home app, notes 9to5Google , and it confirms many of the rumors we've been seeing in recent months, such as the USB-C port on the bottom of the phone and the front-facing speakers. \nWalmart's leak follows on the heels of a leak yesterday from Evan Blass, who posted images of the upcoming device in its smaller and larger forms. \nBoth images suggest that the glass on the edges of the display will be slightly curved, but the display itself will be a traditional flat surface. Blass' images showed the phones with a black body, but the image from Walmart seemingly confirms we'll also be able to get it with a white body (although the face will remain black). Google Pixel 2 XL (Photo Credit: Evan Blass) \nBased on the images from Blass and Walmart, the Google Pixel 2 and the Google Pixel 2 XL look similar for the most part, but the larger Google Pixel XL 2 boasts a taller 18:9 screen and a lot less bezel while the smaller Google Pixel 2 retains much the same shape as its predecessor. \nWalmart has already taken the page down. As it was focused on the Google Home Mini and the phone image was merely in view to illustrate the Mini's pairing capability, the leak unfortunately didn't reveal more than that. \nOn the bright side, there are plenty of other leaks to choose from. Leaks have been so common that we've already posted a buying guide of sorts, which can already tell you about the Google Pixel 2 vs the Pixel XL As for whatever's left to surprise us?

The news is also problematic as this means roughly 2 billion users didn\u2019t get direct notifications. Yahoo points out, though, that it also notified all users of the breach on its website. \nVerizon is almost certainly less than thrilled with the news as the breach was the primary reason for the $350 million discount it received off the price of Yahoo.

Its pictures sometimes look strong, too. However, if you were hoping to get a convincing high dynamic range picture for so little money, you\u2019re out of luck \u2013 Sony's X720E Series doesn't have them. For Lacks brightness with HDR Relatively limited smart services \nAt just $749, the 55X720E \u2013 the middle child of Sony's all-new X720E Series \u2013 is the most affordable 4K HDR 55-inch TV in Sony\u2019s 2017 range. \nThis makes it a potentially mouthwatering proposition given the impressive performance of every other Sony TV we\u2019ve tested this year. \nIts price includes a solid smart system, too - though, it's worth pointing out that you don\u2019t get the Android TV platform featured on more expensive Sony TVs. \nThere are some good things about the 55X720E\u2019s pictures but, if you\u2019re serious about HDR, you\u2019d be advised to try and increase your budget a bit. Design \nScreen sizes available: 43, 49, 55, 65 inches 4K: Yes HDR: Yes (HDR10, HLG HDR - but only via HDMI) Panel technology: LCD Smart TV: Yes, Proprietary system Curved: No Dimensions: 1232(w) x 717(h) x 57(d) mm 3D: No Inputs: Three HDMIs, three USBs, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, optical audio output, Aerial port; composite video port \nThe 55X720E might feel like it should for the price, but it doesn\u2019t look it: By which we mean that its lightweight build feels almost 100% plastic when you\u2019re setting it up, yet you don\u2019t really feel aware of this flimsiness when looking at its angular, minimalistic design from a typical viewing distance. \nThe open frame stand is particularly good at delivering this illusion of quality. For while it\u2019s so plasticky it bends and flops about before you attach it, once screwed to the TV frame it suddenly becomes reassuringly rigid and looks actually quite posh with its gleaming faux-metallic finish. \nIt\u2019s nice to find the 55X720E using a centrally mounted stand rather than edge-mounted feet too, since this means you don\u2019t need to find a particularly wide bit of furniture to put it on. \nConnections are fair enough for the 55X720E\u2019s price point: Three HDMIs lead the way (two of which can handle HDR), partnered by three USBs, an aerial input for the integrated Freeview HD tuner, an optical digital audio output, Wi-Fi and Ethernet network connections and, in a slightly odd throwback to the past, a composite video port. \nOne very nice thing about the connections is that in keeping with all of Sony\u2019s TVs this year, the stand provides built-in conduits for hiding away all of your cable spaghetti. \nThe remote control shipped with the 55X720E is not one of Sony\u2019s finest hours, however \u2013 its build quality is plasticky in the extreme, and while it handily sports direct buttons for YouTube and Netflix, its main navigation buttons are far too cramped together for comfort. Even after using the remote for days we still routinely accidentally chose the wrong button. \nDesign: TL;DR: Although it\u2019s far from the most opulently built TV you\u2019ll see this year, the X720E looks crisp and clean from a normal seating distance. Smart TV (Proprietary Sony system) \nUnlike all the TVs higher up Sony\u2019s 2017 range, the 55X720E doesn\u2019t carry Google\u2019s Android TV platform. \nThis is arguably a cause for celebration rather than annoyance, though, given Android TV\u2019s clunky, cluttered, sluggish and, worst of all, buggy interface. \nCompared to the other Sony TVs we've used this year, it\u2019s certainly refreshing how fast the menus load, how relatively simple they are to browse, and how focused they are on apps you might actually want to use on a TV. \nThey also cover the key US bases by carrying Netflix, Amazon, YouTube (all in their 4K HDR-streaming incarnations), plus all of the \u2018big four\u2019 UK terrestrial broadcasting catch up services: the BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All4 and Demand 5. \nSmart TV TL;DR: The 55X720E\u2019s smart system is pretty basic by current smart TV standards ... but that arguably just makes it easier to use over Android TV. HD/SDR Performance \nWith good old HD, standard dynamic range video of the sort that still eats up the vast majority of your viewing time \u2013 for this, the X720E Series is excellent for the money. Its ability to deliver - after a bit of tweaking - a really rich, deep, even black color during dark scenes is particularly impressive for a set that uses edge-mounted LED backlighting. \nThe tweaks we mentioned involve reducing brightness to around its 26 level, reducing contrast to around 85, setting the advanced contrast enhancer to high, and the Black Adjust feature to Medium. Take special care with that last adjustment, since if you leave it on 'Low' dark scenes look too grey, while if you put it on 'High' shadow detailing takes a hammering. \nThe X720E also punches well above its weight with its upscaling of HD sources. \nIts 4K X-Reality Pro processing system is no longer the state of the art among Sony TVs, but it still manages to add in the millions of extra pixels required to make HD into 4K without exaggerating source noise, making narrow edges look stressed, or suffering any of the common side effects you get with less impressive upscalers. \nThe prowess of the 55X720E\u2019s upscaling can also be seen in its superb SDR color performance. Tones across the board look natural, full of nuance, punchy by SDR standards and free of that plasticky, cartoonish look you get with less refined TVs. \nSony has even been able to retain its traditional strength with motion handling on the series, too. Its Motionflow processing is better than any rival platform at smoothing away judder and blur without generating unwanted side effects. Though actually, even if you choose not to use Motionflow on purist grounds, movement still looks markedly crisper and more natural on the 55XE0 than it does on the vast majority of other similarly affordable TVs. \nThere are a trio of niggles with the 55X720E\u2019s SDR/HD performance, the most serious one being the set\u2019s very limited viewing angle. Watch from more than 20 degrees off axis and the picture starts to grey over and lose color intensity. \nLesser issues are some slight shadow detail crushing when you\u2019ve optimized the contrast settings to deliver the most realistic black colors, and the occasional appearance of gentle \u2018torchlight\u2019 backlight clouding sneaking into the picture\u2019s top corners when a mostly dark image contains a bright object at its centre. \nLet\u2019s finish on an upbeat note, though, with the 55X720E\u2019s input lag performance: The set takes, on average, barely 20ms to render image data received at its inputs, making it a prime contender as a big-screen gaming monitor. \nIn fact, for much of the time its input lag is barely 10ms; the mean figure is only pushed up by the occasional momentary 50ms slip. \nHD/SDR performance: The 55X720E is terrific for its money with HD Blu-rays and digital HD broadcasts. Its upscaling is excellent, and its contrast and colors are strong. Just try not to watch it from a wide angle. 4K/HDR Performance \nThe 55X720E gets one half of the 4K/HDR equation right, at least, as its pictures do a surprisingly good job for such an affordable TV of delivering the extra detail, textures and depth associated with a 4K-resolution image. \nThe clarity even holds up well when during camera pans, or when there\u2019s a lot of movement across the image, thanks to the motion prowess discussed in the previous section. The clarity of 4K motion is especially mesmerizing and effective with MotionFlow set to standard. \nThe 4K X-Reality Pro processing engine also helps to enhance detail with 4K sources beyond what you see with other \u2018budget\u2019 TVs (as well as improving HD upscaling, as mentioned in the previous section). Just don\u2019t be tempted to set the Resolution component of the menus\u2019 Reality Creation feature too high, though, or 4K pictures will start to look noisy. Also, though, keep the noise reduction systems all turned off for native 4K content if you don\u2019t want to lose some of the image\u2019s lovely crispness. \nThe 55X720E is, alas, on much shakier ground when it comes to showing high dynamic range (HDR) images. \nFor starters, it just isn\u2019t bright enough to do the HDR format justice. We measured light output from a 10% pure white HDR window of around 360 nits. Most high-end HDR TVs, by comparison, try to hit 1000 nits and beyond - not least because that\u2019s the brightness level at which much of today\u2019s HDR content is mastered. \nOnly having 360 nits in its arsenal means the 55X720E only provides a marginal sense of HDR\u2019s extra peak luminance punch over SDR images, for instance. You\u2019re also denied pretty much all of that extra sense of \u2018daylight\u2019 brightness with exterior shots that\u2019s one of HDR\u2019s main raisons d\u2019etre. \nColours hardly enjoy any more \u2018volume\u2019, vibrancy or real-life lustre in HDR than they do with a traditional HD, SDR image. \nIn fact, HDR colors occasionally - especially with skin tones - look slightly less natural than SDR ones, as the TV struggles to deliver enough brightness to unlock the full palette of tones a wide color gamut HDR source provides. We suspect the 55X720E is also suffering here because it doesn\u2019t boast the impressive Triluminos color engine sported by Sony\u2019s higher-end TVs. \nThat\u2019s not the only way in which HDR pictures can actually be more uncomfortable to watch at times than SDR ones, either. There\u2019s also some pretty noticeable \u2018clipping\u2019 in the brightest areas of HDR images. In other words, the set\u2019s lack of brightness prevents it from being able to resolve subtle tone details in the brightest areas, leaving such areas looking hollow, bleached and also, at times, strikingly noisy - almost pixellated, in fact. \nThen there\u2019s the 55X720E\u2019s black level response. This Sony set doesn\u2019t have any local dimming; it can only adjust the brightness of its whole array of frame-mounted lights to suit changes in the content, rather than running different light segments at different luminance levels. This means that when it has to show a bright HDR element amid an otherwise pretty dark backdrop, the image becomes rather grey and flat as the set trades the need to get brightness to the bright element against the need to keep the rest of the image looking dark. \nSony\u2019s step up models, the X850E range and, especially, the X900E range, deliver this sort of LCD light compromise much more effectively. \nThere\u2019s a touch of unevenness to the backlighting at these moments too, leaving some areas looking marginally cloudier than others. There are much worse offenders out there in this regard, it must be said. But it\u2019s still another slight distraction on top of the general washed look to dark HDR scenes. \nIt\u2019s worth adding finally, too, that the viewing angle limitations noted in the HD/SDR performance section are exacerbated with HDR content, at least where contrast loss is concerned. \n4K/HDR Performance TL;DR: From a 4K perspective the series is excellent. It's crisp, detailed and good at retaining its sharpness with 4K motion. It's not bright enough to really make HDR count, though, and its backlight causes one or two HDR issues too. Sound \nThe 55X720E doesn\u2019t feature any forward facing speakers, and its build quality doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u2018hi-fi\u2019 either. \nIn truth, though, while it doesn\u2019t set your ears alight, it\u2019s functional enough to make adding a soundbar a luxury rather than an outright necessity. \nThere\u2019s a reasonably open and dynamic feeling to its midrange that helps it avoid distortion and excessive harshness, even though there\u2019s not much bass around to add meat to action scenes. \nThat said, it can go reasonably loud, too, and also manages to spread its sound pretty successfully beyond the confines of its bodywork. \nSound TL;DR: The 55X720E manages a clean, open sound despite its flimsy build quality. Don\u2019t expect much bass, though. Other panels to ponder \nThere aren\u2019t many 4K HDR TVs around at the 55X720E\u2019s price point, sadly. Hisense\u2019s 55N6800 (a UK exclusive) costs pretty much the same, but while it offers slightly better black levels, the Sony beats it on color, motion and 4K upscaling. \nOur advice here, really - at least if you care about HDR - would be that you try and save up for a brighter, more color-rich step-up model such as Sony\u2019s own 55XE8596, or the Samsung 55MU7000. Verdict \nIf you\u2019re not bothered by HDR the 55X720E is worth considering. Its 4K standard dynamic range and HD SDR pictures are both very strong for such an affordable TV, and while its smart TV system is limited in scope, it ticks all the key boxes most UK TV users would want. \nIt\u2019s not bright enough to do HDR justice, though. In fact, trying to play HDR on it arguably does more harm than good to its pictures. A bit of a problem when you consider that some sources - such as streamed shows from Amazon and Netflix, and 4K Blu-ray playback from some relatively basic 4K Blu-ray players - don\u2019t let you separate their 4K playback from their HDR playback.

Its pictures sometimes look strong, too. However, if you were hoping to get a convincing high dynamic range picture for so little money, you\u2019re out of luck \u2013 Sony's XE70 Series doesn't have them. For It\u2019s cheap as chips Against Lacks brightness with HDR Relatively limited smart services \nAt just \u00a3649, the 55XE70 \u2013 the middle child of Sony's all-new XE70 Series \u2013 is the most affordable 4K HDR 55-inch TV in Sony\u2019s 2017 range. \nThis makes it a potentially mouthwatering proposition given the impressive performance of every other Sony TV we\u2019ve tested this year. \nIts price includes a solid smart system, too - though, it's worth pointing out that you don\u2019t get the Android TV platform featured on more expensive Sony TVs. \nThere are some good things about the 55XE70\u2019s pictures but, if you\u2019re serious about HDR, you\u2019d be advised to try and increase your budget a bit. Design \nScreen sizes available: 43, 49, 55, 65 inches Tuner: Freeview HD HDR: Yes (HDR10, HLG HDR - but only via HDMI) Panel technology: LCD Smart TV: Yes, Proprietary system Curved: No Dimensions: 1232(w) x 717(h) x 57(d) mm 3D: No Inputs: Three HDMIs, three USBs, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, optical audio output, Aerial port; composite video port \nThe 55XE70 might feel like it should for the price, but it doesn\u2019t look it: By which we mean that its lightweight build feels almost 100% plastic when you\u2019re setting it up, yet you don\u2019t really feel aware of this flimsiness when looking at its angular, minimalistic design from a typical viewing distance. \nThe open frame stand is particularly good at delivering this illusion of quality. For while it\u2019s so plasticky it bends and flops about before you attach it, once screwed to the TV frame it suddenly becomes reassuringly rigid and looks actually quite posh with its gleaming faux-metallic finish. \nIt\u2019s nice to find the 55XE70 using a centrally mounted stand rather than edge-mounted feet too, since this means you don\u2019t need to find a particularly wide bit of furniture to put it on. \nConnections are fair enough for the 55XE70\u2019s price point: Three HDMIs lead the way (two of which can handle HDR), partnered by three USBs, an aerial input for the integrated Freeview HD tuner, an optical digital audio output, Wi-Fi and Ethernet network connections and, in a slightly odd throwback to the past, a composite video port. \nOne very nice thing about the connections is that in keeping with all of Sony\u2019s TVs this year, the stand provides built-in conduits for hiding away all of your cable spaghetti. \nThe remote control shipped with the 55XE70 is not one of Sony\u2019s finest hours, however \u2013 its build quality is plasticky in the extreme, and while it handily sports direct buttons for YouTube and Netflix, its main navigation buttons are far too cramped together for comfort. Even after using the remote for days we still routinely accidentally chose the wrong button. \nDesign: TL;DR: Although it\u2019s far from the most opulently built TV you\u2019ll see this year, the XE70 looks crisp and clean from a normal seating distance. Smart TV (Proprietary Sony system) \nUnlike all the TVs higher up Sony\u2019s 2017 range, the 55XE70 doesn\u2019t carry Google\u2019s Android TV platform. \nThis is arguably a cause for celebration rather than annoyance, though, given Android TV\u2019s clunky, cluttered, sluggish and, worst of all, buggy interface. \nCompared to the other Sony TVs we've used this year, it\u2019s certainly refreshing how fast the menus load, how relatively simple they are to browse, and how focused they are on apps you might actually want to use on a TV. \nThey also cover the key US bases by carrying Netflix, Amazon, YouTube (all in their 4K HDR-streaming incarnations), plus all of the \u2018big four\u2019 UK terrestrial broadcasting catch up services: the BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All4 and Demand 5. \nThe only serious omission, really, is Now TV. Unless, unlike us, you happen to be a big fan of the countless game and infotainment apps that you get with some more \u2018content-rich\u2019 platforms. \nSmart TV TL;DR: The 55XE70\u2019s smart system is pretty basic by current smart TV standards ... but that arguably just makes it easier to use over Android TV. HD/SDR Performance \nWith good old HD, standard dynamic range video of the sort that still eats up the vast majority of your viewing time \u2013 for this, the XE70 Series is excellent for the money. Its ability to deliver - after a bit of tweaking - a really rich, deep, even black colour during dark scenes is particularly impressive for a set that uses edge-mounted LED backlighting. \nThe tweaks we mentioned involve reducing brightness to around its 26 level, reducing contrast to around 85, setting the advanced contrast enhancer to high, and the Black Adjust feature to Medium. Take special care with that last adjustment, since if you leave it on 'Low' dark scenes look too grey, while if you put it on 'High' shadow detailing takes a hammering. \nThe XE70 also punches well above its weight with its upscaling of HD sources. \nIts 4K X-Reality Pro processing system is no longer the state of the art among Sony TVs, but it still manages to add in the millions of extra pixels required to make HD into 4K without exaggerating source noise, making narrow edges look stressed, or suffering any of the common side effects you get with less impressive upscalers. \nThe prowess of the 55XE70\u2019s upscaling can also be seen in its superb SDR colour performance. Tones across the board look natural, full of nuance, punchy by SDR standards and free of that plasticky, cartoonish look you get with less refined TVs. \nSony has even been able to retain its traditional strength with motion handling on the series, too. Its Motionflow processing is better than any rival platform at smoothing away judder and blur without generating unwanted side effects. Though actually, even if you choose not to use Motionflow on purist grounds, movement still looks markedly crisper and more natural on the 55XE0 than it does on the vast majority of other similarly affordable TVs. \nThere are a trio of niggles with the 55XE70\u2019s SDR/HD performance, the most serious one being the set\u2019s very limited viewing angle. Watch from more than 20 degrees off axis and the picture starts to grey over and lose colour intensity. \nLesser issues are some slight shadow detail crushing when you\u2019ve optimised the contrast settings to deliver the most realistic black colours, and the occasional appearance of gentle \u2018torchlight\u2019 backlight clouding sneaking into the picture\u2019s top corners when a mostly dark image contains a bright object at its centre. \nLet\u2019s finish on an upbeat note, though, with the 55XE70\u2019s input lag performance: The set takes, on average, barely 20ms to render image data received at its inputs, making it a prime contender as a big-screen gaming monitor. \nIn fact, for much of the time its input lag is barely 10ms; the mean figure is only pushed up by the occasional momentary 50ms slip. \nHD/SDR performance: The 55XE70 is terrific for its money with HD Blu-rays and digital HD broadcasts. Its upscaling is excellent, and its contrast and colours are strong. Just try not to watch it from a wide angle. 4K/HDR Performance \nThe 55XE70 gets one half of the 4K/HDR equation right, at least, as its pictures do a surprisingly good job for such an affordable TV of delivering the extra detail, textures and depth associated with a 4K-resolution image. \nThe clarity even holds up well when during camera pans, or when there\u2019s a lot of movement across the image, thanks to the motion prowess discussed in the previous section. The clarity of 4K motion is especially mesmerising and effective with MotionFlow set to standard. \nThe 4K X-Reality Pro processing engine also helps to enhance detail with 4K sources beyond what you see with other \u2018budget\u2019 TVs (as well as improving HD upscaling, as mentioned in the previous section). Just don\u2019t be tempted to set the Resolution component of the menus\u2019 Reality Creation feature too high, though, or 4K pictures will start to look noisy. Also, though, keep the noise reduction systems all turned off for native 4K content if you don\u2019t want to lose some of the image\u2019s lovely crispness. \nThe 55XE70 is, alas, on much shakier ground when it comes to showing high dynamic range (HDR) images. \nFor starters, it just isn\u2019t bright enough to do the HDR format justice. We measured light output from a 10% pure white HDR window of around 360 nits. Most high-end HDR TVs, by comparison, try to hit 1000 nits and beyond - not least because that\u2019s the brightness level at which much of today\u2019s HDR content is mastered. \nOnly having 360 nits in its arsenal means the 55XE70 only provides a marginal sense of HDR\u2019s extra peak luminance punch over SDR images, for instance. You\u2019re also denied pretty much all of that extra sense of \u2018daylight\u2019 brightness with exterior shots that\u2019s one of HDR\u2019s main raisons d\u2019etre. \nColours hardly enjoy any more \u2018volume\u2019, vibrancy or real-life lustre in HDR than they do with a traditional HD, SDR image. \nIn fact, HDR colours occasionally - especially with skin tones - look slightly less natural than SDR ones, as the TV struggles to deliver enough brightness to unlock the full palette of tones a wide colour gamut HDR source provides. We suspect the 55XE70 is also suffering here because it doesn\u2019t boast the impressive Triluminos colour engine sported by Sony\u2019s higher-end TVs. \nThat\u2019s not the only way in which HDR pictures can actually be more uncomfortable to watch at times than SDR ones, either. There\u2019s also some pretty noticeable \u2018clipping\u2019 in the brightest areas of HDR images. In other words, the set\u2019s lack of brightness prevents it from being able to resolve subtle tone details in the brightest areas, leaving such areas looking hollow, bleached and also, at times, strikingly noisy - almost pixellated, in fact. \nThen there\u2019s the 55XE70\u2019s black level response. This Sony set doesn\u2019t have any local dimming; it can only adjust the brightness of its whole array of frame-mounted lights to suit changes in the content, rather than running different light segments at different luminance levels. This means that when it has to show a bright HDR element amid an otherwise pretty dark backdrop, the image becomes rather grey and flat as the set trades the need to get brightness to the bright element against the need to keep the rest of the image looking dark. \nSony\u2019s step up models, the XE8596 range and, especially, the XE9005 range, deliver this sort of LCD light compromise much more effectively. \nThere\u2019s a touch of unevenness to the backlighting at these moments too, leaving some areas looking marginally cloudier than others. There are much worse offenders out there in this regard, it must be said. But it\u2019s still another slight distraction on top of the general washed look to dark HDR scenes. \nIt\u2019s worth adding finally, too, that the viewing angle limitations noted in the HD/SDR performance section are exacerbated with HDR content, at least where contrast loss is concerned. \n4K/HDR Performance TL;DR: From a 4K perspective the series is excellent. It's crisp, detailed and good at retaining its sharpness with 4K motion. It's not bright enough to really make HDR count, though, and its backlight causes one or two HDR issues too.

Microsoft \u2013 and a digitally-rendered Samsung executive \u2013 showed off the new head-mounted display (HMD) at a press event in San Francisco. \nSamsung\u2019s new headset is the most expensive in the Windows MR family, coming in at $499 (about \u00a3377, AU$635). But, it\u2019s the only one to include built-in headphones with spatial audio, and it will also ship with two motion controllers when it releases on November 6. \nBecause of the headphones, paired controllers and the headset\u2019s outstanding visuals, the Samsung HMD Odyssey is the most complete device in the Windows MR family. We tried the Odyssey, Acer Mixed Reality Head-Mounted Display and the Dell Visor at Microsoft\u2019s press event (Asus, Lenovo and HP are also releasing Windows MR headsets), and Samsung\u2019s stood head-and-shoulders above the Visor and just edged out Acer\u2019s offering. \nWhile not exactly on par with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive in terms of sheer graphics rendering (though pretty darn close) and build quality, the Samsung HMD Odyssey is worth considering if you want to stay within the Windows ecosystem and own a compatible PC. \nIn a vacuum, Samsung\u2019s newest device didn\u2019t blow me away, but if made to choose between headsets for Windows MR, I'd pick the Odyssey to take the journey with. Pre-order the Samsung HMD Odyssey today Design \nAs far as design goes, the Samsung HMD Odyssey is nothing to get excited about. It\u2019s black with no color accents at all. It bears a close resemblance to the LG SteamVR headset we saw back at GDC 2017, even down to the tiered headband that goes across your forehead. \nThe visor, more rounded than LG\u2019s, is shiny and, aside from some engravings, that\u2019s the only flair on an otherwise matte black device. \nThe headset also has a somewhat budget quality to it, which could be owing to its lightweight feel (it weights 645g, or just under 1.5 pounds). To be honest, we weren\u2019t bothered by the inexpensive impression it left, as the headset didn\u2019t feel flimsy or poorly made; plus, it was super comfortable to wear. However, if you\u2019re spending $500 on a device, you may want something that feels a bit more substantial. \nThe visor doesn\u2019t flip all the way up like Acer\u2019s design, though it lifts up and forward enough for you to slide the contraption easily over your head. To tighten the device, you scroll a little dial on the back. The built-in AKG headphones slide down and, before you know it, you\u2019re immersed in the Windows Mixed Reality world. \nAs mentioned, the Samsung HMD Odyssey is exceptionally comfortable. It feels as though we could wear it easily for a lengthy period without experiencing neck strain or developing that cinching feeling around the cranium that other headsets tend to induce. \nOf the three devices we compared at Microsoft\u2019s press event, Acer\u2019s was the lightest (it weighs 350g), but Samsung\u2019s was overall the most pleasant to wear. Performance \nThe standout features of the Samsung HMD Odyssey are its dual AMOLED displays. The screens pop with a resolution of 1,440 x 1,600 pixels per side and a refresh rate of between 90 to 60Hz. The Acer Mixed Reality HMD, for comparison, has a resolution of 1,440 x 1,440 per lens with a 90Hz refresh rate. \nOn paper, the numbers seem close. In reality, however, Samsung\u2019s visuals are buttery smooth with an added vividness to the colors that is noticeable. Acer\u2019s visuals were slightly more muted and just a touch more rough. The AMOLED display tech, which Samsung is known for on its Galaxy phones, clearly makes a difference. And, compared to the Dell Visor, which has visuals with a dull and even more pronounced ragged quality to them, the Samsung HMD Odyssey is undoubtedly superior. \nInside the headset, our demos ran about as smoothly as we\u2019ve seen on any virtual or augmented reality device, with zero stutter or lag during the experience. We were taken into the Cliff House, which acts as a home base inside Windows MR from which you jump into different experiences, such as Halo Recruit and Move, a creative app lets you paint in the air using the controllers. The controllers do light up \nCliff House is broken into different sectors, and you \u2018teleport\u2019 between them by flicking the analog stick and pressing the trigger button on the controllers. This function works effectively. A trackpad on the controllers lets you scroll through webpages (that was the only use for it we were made privy to). When you want to exit an experience, you hit the Windows button on the controllers, and you\u2019re instantly taken back home. \nAll in all, the controllers work fine, though they aren\u2019t as intuitive to use and don\u2019t feel as good in the hand as the Oculus Touch controller. \nWith cameras for six-degrees-of-freedom, or 6DOF, and inside-out tracking built inside the headset, moving around within the virtual world felt natural. You don\u2019t have to worry about external sensors; everything is self-contained, which is one of the advantages Microsoft touts for the Windows Mixed Reality platform over Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. \nBut, whereas inside-out tracking offers convenience in not having to outfit a room for VR, as you do with HTC Vive, the latter\u2019s room-scale Chaperone system is handy at keeping you from running into objects. Windows MR doesn\u2019t have the same ability, and we had to be pulled back from a stand several times, and even bonked it (not hard) with the controller on one or two occasions. \nLack of room-scale tracking isn\u2019t the Achilles\u2019 heel of Windows MR, but once you\u2019ve tried HTC Vive and see those blue outlines telling you a wall is close by, it\u2019s apparent when the feature is missing. Even more to the point, you run into more stuff or come in danger of doing so when it\u2019s not there. \n6DOF and inside-out tracking give you a sense of space inside a VR realm, but there\u2019s an unmistakable separation from the virtual world and what\u2019s going on outside the visor that leaves you feeling a little bit vulnerable. \nAs for the headphones, these sound crisp; Cortana rang through our ears with helpful directions, and music and characters\u2019 voices came through with clarity during demos. Unlike the Acer and Dell headsets, which require donning separate headsets in true accessory fashion, the spatial audio on the Samsung HMD Odyssey make it feel like a complete Windows MR device. Early verdict \nMove over, Acer Mixed Reality HMD. There\u2019s a new ruler of the Windows Mixed Reality realm, and its name is Samsung HMD Odyssey. \nWhere Samsung\u2019s headset stands out from Acer in particular is in the displays; the Odyssey\u2019s visuals are just that much smoother and more vibrant than Acer\u2019s that, while anything but bad, lack the same punch. \nSamsung HMD Odyssey offers a fun, eye-popping joyride into the world of virtual reality, and while its cost falls on this side of \u2018maybe I shouldn\u2019t,\u2019 the built-in spatial audio adds a completeness to the system that the other Windows MR devices lack. \nShould Oculus Rift and HTC Vive be worried? HTC Vive may be safe for now because of its industry-leading room-scale tracking, but Oculus Rift should probably watch its back. We find the Odyssey to be more comfortable to wear than Rift, and this editor didn\u2019t experience the nausea she usually does after just a few minutes in Rift\u2019s worlds. \nWhat\u2019s more, as with the other Windows Mixed Reality headsets, accessibility is a hallmark of the Samsung HMD Odyssey. There are no external sensors to set up, and whereas the higher-end competitors require a top-end PC to run VR experiences, a device as lightweight as an Ultrabook can generate Windows MR worlds. Though the Oculus Rift headset and controller bundle costs the same as the Odyssey, there\u2019s the slightly less visible cost of the accompanying gaming rig that comes into play for an Oculus. \nStill, even though Samsung has put forward a worthy competitor to the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, those devices have a strong hold on the market, and it may be difficult for the Odyssey, or any Windows MR device, to break through. Not that Microsoft won\u2019t try, of course. What is a hands on review? \n'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it.

In other words, the seller should be carrying an Amazon-fulfilled badge on their profile. Unfortunately, if you don\u2019t find a valid seller but the deal is irresistible, have a look at the seller's profile and comments left by previous customers. If the seller looks clean, go for the deal.\nAlong with this, you might find some discounts being offered on products at their MRP\u2019s.

To counter that, ensure that the seller you\u2019re buying your favourite product from is certified by Amazon India. In other words, the seller should be carrying an Amazon-fulfilled badge on their profile. Unfortunately, if you don\u2019t find a valid seller but the deal is irresistible, have a look at the seller's profile and comments left by previous customers. If the seller looks clean, go for the deal. \nAlong with this, you might find some discounts being offered on products at their MRP\u2019s. To get the best deals users can use price comparison websites such as mysmartprice to check whether the product is being offered at a genuine discounted rate. \nAdditionally, do not respond to emails and click links from shady sources as that could be a phishing attempt. \nHappy shopping, people!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flipkart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zook", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mrp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macbook air", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jbl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panasonic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flipkart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of marley smile jamaica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "best", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenovo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "logitech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philips", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon app jackpot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nokia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motorola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seagate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fitbit blaze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portronics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T11:20:56.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fdffcf6e63608aceaa77d2e72e5258f5286faaf4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3urQWh43oVgGlsf7Z9aIuM3HdRs3ZBgGBpjH_w9cDS.E9MnLb.81PCw7U.nI616.n6jHpdFCHBbPb4CMj5GmFW_sH_kd7NUvDRCgvIqlUvU4-", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://techradar.com//rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - All the latest technology news", "title": "Surface Laptop banishes storage woes as 1TB SSD model goes on sale", "title_full": "Surface Laptop banishes storage woes as 1TB SSD model goes on sale", "published": "2017-10-04T12:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BaVoznUzXKW6bU6erp6WeH-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 15, "comments": 0, "shares": 15}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fdffcf6e63608aceaa77d2e72e5258f5286faaf4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3urQWh43oVgGlsf7Z9aIuM3HdRs3ZBgGBpjH_w9cDS.E9MnLb.81PCw7U.nI616.n6jHpdFCHBbPb4CMj5GmFW_sH_kd7NUvDRCgvIqlUvU4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Darren Allan", "published": "2017-10-04T12:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Surface Laptop banishes storage woes as 1TB SSD model goes on sale", "text": "Surface Laptop banishes storage woes as 1TB SSD model goes on sale Surface Laptop banishes storage woes as 1TB SSD model goes on sale Only available with a certain configuration, though Shares \nThere\u2019s some good news for folks who have been thinking of buying a Surface Laptop but wanted to max out the storage, as you can now specify a 1TB SSD with the notebook. \nPreviously, this option was unavailable, and the maximum capacity SSD which could be chosen was 512GB. \nHowever, note that the 1TB drive is only available in one certain configuration at the moment. \nYou\u2019ll need to be purchasing the platinum color Surface Laptop, and you\u2019ll also have to max the rest of the spec out \u2013 meaning you must choose the Core i7 processor along with 16GB of system memory. Shades of gray \nAny other configuration means the option for a 1TB SSD will still be grayed out, although presumably this will change in the future, and maximum storage will also become available in different color models. Although Microsoft hasn\u2019t said anything on the matter right now. \nSo, how much will the platinum Surface Laptop Core i7, 16GB with 1TB SSD set you back? The asking price on Microsoft\u2019s web store is a rather eye-watering \u00a32,699, or $2,699 in the US (AU$3,999 over in Australia). Buy the Surface Laptop Core i7 (16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) from Microsoft\u2019s online store \nThe same model with a 512GB SSD is priced at \u00a32,149 in the UK ($2,199 in the US), so you\u2019re paying an extra \u00a3550 (or $500) to double the size of the drive \u2013 ouch indeed. \nStill, for those who really need the storage space in their notebook, it\u2019s certainly good to have the option to step things up.

You can combine these with 2D sketched elements to create scenes, and even print them in 3D. \nHere, we\u2019ve picked out the very best drawing software for Windows. Some of these tools are designed for serious illustrators, while others are better for keeping children occupied without the mess of real painting. There\u2019s something for everyone \u2013 the only limits are your imagination and skill. \nTop-quality free painting software, completely free for all artists Well designed brushes and tools Accessible interface Handy drawing aids \nKrita is professional-quality painting software created by a team of artists with the noble aim of putting top-notch creative tools within reach of everyone. \nYou can use Krita for any kind of drawing and illustration, but it's particularly great for comics and manga. There are panel templates, halftone filters, and perspective tools in addition to the usual brushes, fills and pens. Each brush is totally customizable, and you can save your bespoke brushes to use again later. \nRight-clicking anywhere on the canvas in Krita will bring up a selection wheel that lets you pick a new tool and select a colour in seconds \u2013 a system that's much easier than trawling through menus and settings \nKrita was created by artists for artists, and it shows in the dozens of thoughtful little touches that make it easier to create great paintings. There are handy drawing aids for creating straight lines, vanishing points and smooth shapes. You also get layers, masks, various transform tools, HDR support, and advanced selection functions. \nKrita is an incredibly powerful painting program, and it's yours to download and use completely free. \nRealistic traditional media, with a huge selection of brushes Realistic media Supports layers Child-friendly interface \nArtweaver Free enables you to create beautifully realistic digital paintings by taking input \u2013 from your mouse, a stylus or, if you have a touchscreen PC, from whatever you feel like tapping the screen with \u2013 and applying ultra-realistic brush effects. \nIn addition to familiar brushes such as conte brushes, calligraphy pens and airbrushes you also get a huge range of patterns and pens, enabling you to produce very complex images with the minimum of effort. It\u2019s layer-based too, so you can build up your masterpiece in layers without losing the ability to change anything. \nArtweaver Free designed for artists of all ages, but we\u2019ve found it particularly useful for children. Kids love experimenting with all the different brushes, and we love not having to clean up any mess afterwards. \nKid-friendly art software for making and painting 3D models Converts drawings to 3D models Wide choice of paint effects 3D effects are quite basic \nMicrosoft Paint 3D was introduced as part of the Windows 10 Creator\u2019s Update, but is also available to download separately in the Windows Store. \nLike the classic version of Microsoft Paint (which was recently saved from an early grave ), Paint 3D offers a small selection of drawing tools for doodling on a flat canvas.

There's a large amount of variation in the quality of their interfaces, HDR, and physical design. \nOur constantly updated list of the best 4K TVs is the best way to find a set that does what you need it to do without spending more money than you need to on extraneous features. \nThe world of TV buying can feel unapproachable when you're first getting into it, but give it some time and it will all make sense. Let's try and make your buying decision at least a bit easier with our picks for the best 4K TVs. \nHere's our current line-up, with details down below: Need to give your TV's sound a boost? Check out our guide to the best soundbars available. 1. LG C7 OLED \nStunning pictures at an affordable price Stunning contrast-rich pictures Excellent operating system Lacks brightness vs LCD \nAt the top of our list for 2017 is the LG OLED C7 \u2013 available in both 55 and 65-inch iterations. It's here because it delivers better brightness and light control than last year\u2019s C6 (something we weren't sure was even possible), making it a high dynamic range performer that doesn't sacrifice OLED\u2019s class-leading standard dynamic range capabilities. It delivers its new picture thrills at a price that finally makes OLED a financially viable alternative to top-end LCD sets making it, beyond a doubt, one of 2017\u2019s most irresistible TVs. \nThere are other OLEDs worth considering this year but we think the OLED C7 offers the best price-to-performance ratio of any TV under the sun in the year 2017. \nRead the full review: LG OLED C7 2. Samsung Q9F QLED \nPhenominally bright panels do wonders for HDR content Fantastic color levels HDR color banding can occur Backlight clouding can be an issue \nSamsung was the first brand to introduce an HDR-compatible screen way back in 2015, but it's not been resting on its haunches ever since. \nIt's latest flagship, the Q9F, is a perfect example of this. It ups the brightness to 1500 nits, 50% higher than the level required for UHD Premium certification, and the brightest TV we've ever tested. \nOutside of an impressive-sounding number this brightness has a real impact on the set's image quality. Detail is preserved in even the brightest areas of the image, and colors are exceptionally vivid and bright. \nEven non-HDR content looks fantastic thanks to Samsung's SDR upscaling technology. \nNo television is perfect, and the Q9F can occasionally suffer from some backlight clouding around bright objects. Additionally some settings cause color striping in HDR colours, but in all other respects this is the best television around at the moment. \nRead the full review: Samsung Q9F 3. LG OLEDE7 series \nOLED isn't done getting better just yet Gorgeous picture quality Minor picture noise problems LCD TVs are still brighter overall \nThanks to the thinness the technology affords, OLED televisions often look striking, but LG's OLEDE7's 'picture on glass' design looks especially fantastic. \nHowever beyond its aesthetic appearance, the set delivers the same great picture quality we've come to expect from OLED, with blacks that are far darker than any you'll see from an LCD TV. \nIt's black levels were already impressive, but LG's development this year has been to boost the maximum brightness level that the set is capable of, resulting in images that really pop. \nLG's flagship this year is the crazy-expensive OLED W7 , but frankly the E7 offers a very similar level of quality at a much lower price. It still looks great, it's still packing Dolby Atmos, and although it can't boast the wallpaper thinness of the W7, it's not far off. \nFor all those reasons and more, the E7 OLED is a worthwhile addition to any home theater. \nRead the full review: LG OLED E7 4. Panasonic EX750 \nA set with couple of tricks up its sleeve Excellent black levels No Dolby Vision Adjustable stand is not that adjustable \nIt might not be OLED, but the Panasonic TX-50EX750 shows LCD still has a lot going for it in 2017. \nWhites and colors generally are bright and clear, blacks are surprisingly black for an LCD and the overall form-factor is nice and simple (in a good way). \nThe only question we have left is price. Panasonic wasn\u2019t sharing pricing details when the set was revealed, but we\u2019re hoping this provides a nice budget counter-argument to its high-end sets. \nRead the full review: Panasonic EX750 5. Sony XE93 series \nBright HDR images and rich colors make this set one worth considering Bright HDR with rich colors ; Great HD upscaling ; Issues with blooming around bright objects ; Sluggish interface ; \nThe Sony XE93 range is the more premium range that sits alongside the XE90 above and it's certainly a more ambitious set. \nThe XE93 features a Sony innovation known as 'slim backlight drive' which attempts to deliver areas of concentrated light in the screen while maintaining a slim form-factor. \nFor the most part this system performs admirably, and creates fantastically bright images that have real punch and intensity to them. \nBut the system does have it's issues with keeping this brightness to the bright areas of the image, where it can occasionally see this light 'bleed' out into darker parts of the image. \nThankfully this set is also no slouch in the sound department; it's happily one of the better sounding TVs out there. \nSo the XE93 is a great looking set, but while it may be much more premium than the XE90 listed above, it doesn't quite go all the way in justifying its increased cost. \nRead the full review: 6. Sony Bravia X9300E series \nSony turns to the bright side using its Slim Backlight Drive Stunningly rich colours Runs sluggishly at times ; Limited viewing angles \nAndroid TV continues to frustrate, and there\u2019s a backlight clouding price to pay for the TV\u2019s high brightness levels. That said, Sony's X9300E series nonetheless improves on Sony\u2019s 2016\u2019s Slim Backlight Drive models in every way, delivering in the process some of the most spectacular pictures ever seen on a TV in 2017. \nRead the full review: Sony X9300E 7.

While Amazon has forged ahead adding numerous smart speakers to its Echo lineup, Google has stuck with just the one speaker, and has seemingly been content to allow third-party companies to bolster the lineup with speakers such as the JBL Link 300 . \nHowever, that's all rumored to be changing at Google's upcoming Pixel 2 launch event , where Google is expected to launch the Google Home Mini, a new puck-sized smart speaker in the same vein as Amazon's low cost Amazon Echo Dot . \nAlthough the speaker is yet to be officially announced, the quantity of leaks makes it seem almost inevitable. \nRead on for everything we know about the rumored smart speaker. Cut to the chase What is it? A smaller version of Google\u2019s smart speaker When is it out? Latest rumors suggest October 19 What will it cost? Leaks suggest it'll be $49 (around \u00a340, AU$60) Google Home Mini release date \nThe latest rumors surrounding the speaker's release date come from a leaked Walmart listing that suggested the speaker will be out on October 19 in the US. \nAlthough this gives us a pretty firm idea of its US release date, we don\u2019t yet have any information about when it will come to the UK. \nThe Google Home speaker was announced at Google I/O, in May 2016, but it didn\u2019t come to the UK until April 6 2017, which was far later than its November 4 2016 US release. \nGiven its past performance, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the UK didn\u2019t see the Google Home Mini until early 2018. \nThen again, now that Google has done the hard work of getting Google Assistant working in the UK, there might not be any cause to delay its newest smart speaker in the territory. Google Home Mini price \nThat same Walmart listing suggested that the device will retail for $49 in the US, though again we don\u2019t have any information for other territories just yet. \nA straight exchange rate conversion suggests that its price will be around \u00a340 in the UK and AU$60 in Australia, but as with all consumer electronics the exact pricing could differ massively. \nWe won\u2019t know for sure until Google officially announces the speaker. Google Home Mini rumors \nIn terms of the functionality of the speaker, we\u2019re expecting it to offer much of the same functionality as the full-size Google Home, albeit with a much smaller (and therefore likely weaker) speaker. \nThe leaked Walmart listing suggests the speaker will measure in at 4.53 x 4.53 x 4.72 inches (11.5cm x 11.5cm x 12cm), which is just a shade bigger than the Amazon Echo Dot\u2019s 3.3 inch diameter and 1.3 inch height. \nThe speaker will be available in three colors , Chalk (a slightly off white), Charcoal (a dark gray) or Coral (light pink). \nThe cord present in the leaked images suggests that the speaker will, like its bigger brother, rely on mains rather than battery power. \nFinally, recent screenshots from someone living near the Google campus suggest that the speaker will unsurprisingly be set up in much the same way as the existing Google Home speaker through the Google Home app. @ArtemR Google Home Mini confirmed. #lol cc @jasonhowell @ronxo @Ohthatflo pic.twitter.com/GpmgDk0T5T October 2, 2017 \nThere are also rumors the device might be announced alongside a Google Home 'Max' .

We love the provision of Ambilight, while 4K images are sharper than a box of tacks. But take claims of HDR support with a pinch of salt. This UHD cheapie doesn\u2019t have what it takes to really dazzle. For Small screen size Cheap build \nThe budget 4K TV aisles are getting crowded. As buyers gravitate to smaller screens, prices are plunging, even as feature specifications get more generous. \nPhilips is a prime agitator. Its latest pocket-change 6 series screen doesn\u2019t skimp on features. In addition to UHD resolution and HDR support, it offers Ambilight, the LED mood lighting system which can now integrate with a larger Hue lighting scheme. And if that doesn\u2019t whet your eyeballs, then nothing will. \nThe 43-inch 43PUS6262 reviewed here is the smallest in Philips 6000 series line-up. It\u2019s joined by the step-up 50-inch 50PUS6262, 55-inch 55PUS6262 and expansive 65-inch 65PUS6262. You\u2019ll be hard pressed to find cheaper screens as well equipped. So what\u2019s the catch? The bezel and stand look good, but closer inspection reveals a plastic construction. Design \nScreen sizes available: 43-inch, 50-inch, 55-inch, 65-inch Tuner: Freeview Play, generic satellite HD 4K: Yes Smart TV: Yes, Philips Smart Curved: No Dimensions: 971.3 x 575.2 x 77.3 mm 3D: No Inputs: 3 x HDMI, 2 x USB, component AV \nCosmetically, this 6 Series TV looks substantial enough. Closer inspection though reveals that bezel and stand are lightweight grey plastic. Connectivity is good. All three HDMI inputs are 4K HDCP 2.2 compatible, a requirement for 4K UHD sources. There\u2019s also a component AV input, two USB ports, plus an optical digital audio output. Ethernet and Wi-Fi are standard. \nThe TV offers a choice of satellite and terrestrial tuners, the latter Freeview Play. For those who haven\u2019t been paying attention, this is the latest iteration of the ubiquitous non-contract TV platform, able to seamlessly mix over-the-air channels with internet delivered catch-up. \nA quad core processor keeps navigation snappy. The menus are standard Philips fare, and as such are reasonably intuitive. A convenient Home button pulls up a vertical list for channels, Freeview Play guide, sources and settings. \nDesign TL;DR: The thin bezel and lightweight stand look smart enough, but build quality is plasticky A decent amount of streaming services are included. Smart TV - Philips \nPhilips doesn\u2019t offer Android on this screen (it\u2019s available further up the range), but its basic connected proposition is solid nonetheless. Freeview Play puts all the UK's main Catch Up TV services (BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, Demand 5) within easy reach, via a 7-day TV guide, as well as UKTV Play and BBC News and Sport apps. \nA generic smart hub then offers Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Video and Vimeo, amongst others. Netflix streams in 4K HDR, while Amazon is 4K. There\u2019s also support for YouTube 4K streams. \nSmart TV TL;DR: Not the most advanced Smart TV platform you\u2019ll find, but it does the job All three HDMI inputs are 4K HDCP 2.2 compatible, a requirement for 4K UHD sources. HD/SDR Performance \nFull HD imagery looks crisp and thanks to the pixel density of the 4K panel has a photographic sheen which delights. This set looks sharp with Freeview HD and looks excellent with regular Blu-ray. \nIn keeping with its sub-\u00a3500 price point, panel brightness is limited. Which presents us with an early caveat. A consequence of running HDR10 content into such a screen is that the set actually pulls down the average picture level, presumably as it attempts to tone map. This can make some HDR content look surprisingly dark. Consequently, this set actually looks consistently better with SDR content. \nHD/SDR Performance TL;DR: Full HD and SDR look great here, with UHD pixel density adding a photographic smoothness to 1080p sources 4K/HDR Performance \nAll things considered, UHD image clarity is extremely good. The set zings with 4K from Sky Q . However, as we\u2019ve hinted, its HDR performance is more of a talking point. We measured peak HDR luminance, with a 5 per cent window, at just over 350 cd/m2 (aka nits), which is no different from an SDR LED LCD screen at a comparable price. With Star Trek Discovery (Netflix), the HDR lens flare and otherworldly highlights don\u2019t get beamed onboard. If you want bright spectral highlights, you won\u2019t find them here. \nThere are also predictable issues with black level. It\u2019s not profound, and you\u2019ll find a lot of near black shadow detail has been crushed from sight. But these issues shouldn\u2019t surprise when you\u2019re buying on a tight budget. \nColours are lush. When Okja (Netflix, 4K HDR) frolics in a pool, it\u2019s invitingly blue, the surround forest is a rampant green. You have a decent amount of control over the picture quality once you jump into the set's menus. \nThere\u2019s no shortage of viewing options. Modes include Personal, Vivid, Natural, Standard, Movie and Game; these become HDR Personal, HDR Vivid, HDR Natural, HDR Movie and HDR Game when triggered. There are deeper adjustments to be had, including contrast, sharpness, brightness and motion. \nMotion handling is a bit arbitrary. Somewhat surprisingly, we encountered more overt artefacts using Standard and Smooth image processing from the Motion Style menu, than the Sports option. When watching films, the 'Off' or 'Movies' settings are the most cinematic. Select the Personal Motion Style and you unlock the Natural Motion sub menu, but with Natural Motion on Medium you\u2019ll still see minor artefacts. \nThe screen itself is a tad reflective, so take care with placement. This can work against contrast and clarity in a brightly light room. \n4K/HDR Performance TL;DR: Sit close to appreciate the extra clarity offered by UHD, but don\u2019t expect miracles when it comes to HDR delivery Sound \nThe TV\u2019s audio performance is adequate. There\u2019s a variety of sound modes (Personal, Original, Movie, Music, Game and News), but you\u2019ll not get too much variation with these. Ultimately, your ears will benefit most from the addition of an external sound system, be it soundbar, two channel stereo system or soundbase. \nSound Quality TL;DR: As befits a bargain TV, the screen makes a functional noise. But it\u2019s worth budgeting for a step-up TV audio solution Other panels to ponder \nThe forty-something 4K screen market is hotting up, so you\u2019ll find a number of sets competing alongside this Philips. \nHisense touts the 43-inch N5500 range at a similar price point. They\u2019re also HDR compatible and boast an integrated dbx-tv sound system for better audio. They\u2019re in line for a Freeview Play firmware update too. \nElsewhere, British TV manufacture Cello has its new 4K Platinum models. These feature excellent audio out of the box, courtesy of an integrated soundbar, but you\u2019ll need to opt for a 50-inch model to get 4K resolution. They lack HDR though. \nFinally, Samsung's 40-inch MU6400 suffers from similar peak brightness issues to the Philips, but its VA LCD panel offers some sumptuous colors, and its operating system is fast and responsive. Verdict \nWhen it comes to value for money, the 43PUS6262 deserves all the gongs. Its connected services are right on point, and the beauty of two-sided Ambilight will be a deal clincher for many. The provision of HDR may ultimately be a curate's egg (given the TV looks its best with SDR content), but at least you\u2019ll not feel like a second class UHD citizen when browsing Netflix, and fine detail performance is black-tie sharp. Watching this screen, it\u2019s easy to forget just how cheap the price tag actually is. Check out our guide to the best 4K TVs for our top recommendations.

That phone arrived less than six months earlier, making you wonder if this is Lenovo quietly shuffling a phone of which it wasn\u2019t too proud under the sofa. \nThis new phone is only slightly more expensive than the G5 Plus at AED 1,099. However, it is also larger, with a 5.5-inch screen instead of a 5.2-inch one. \nIt\u2019s another solid hit for the series, though, with potentially-fixable camera lag the only major black mark on what is otherwise a great value, high-quality phone. Mid-range specs at an affordable price High-quality metal build A 5.5-inch screen \nThe Moto G series has become a smartphone institution to rival Samsung\u2019s S series. We\u2019ve been recommending these phones to buyers on a budget since the first Moto G appeared in 2013. \nThese phones used to be made by Motorola, now Lenovo. And while a few design priorities have changed in the handover, the core philosophy remains: these are handsets made for people who don\u2019t want to spend an obscene amount on a phone. \nThe Plus models, including the Moto G5S Plus, are for people out for a little more; a larger screen, perhaps more memory and a bit more power. \nNot much time has passed since its predecessor the G5 Plus arrived, making us wonder, what\u2019s different? \nAt first glance, you\u2019d assume the biggest change is the new dual rear camera setup. But it\u2019s not. Two other elements are more important. \nLenovo has significantly improved the build of the Moto G5S Plus, using a full metal jacket rather than a plastic one with a thin sheet of aluminum on the back. This is a top-grade build. \nThe screen is also larger, a 5.5-inch display rather than the 5.2-incher of the G5 Plus. This is a return to the roots of the Plus line, making it seem a phone geared at enthusiasts. \nIn some ways, it\u2019s a much truer sequel to the Moto G4 Plus than the Moto G5 Plus ever was. It also has NFC , missing from the Moto G5 . \nWhere there hasn't been much of a progress is in terms of camera quality, processor power or display technology. There's only so much you can expect from a phone that costs AED 1,099. Design Significantly improved all-metal shell Front fingerprint scanner \nLast time around, Lenovo tried to trick us a bit with the Moto G5 and G5 Plus. They were metal phones, but only just. A significant part of the frame was plastic, particularly on the smaller Moto G5. \nLenovo has fixed this in the Moto G5S Plus. Every part of the shell apart from the antenna lines on the back and the glass covering the display and camera is aluminum. There\u2019s no sneaky plastic anywhere. \nThe build is a full league above that of the previous phones and this is comfortably the best-looking Moto G phone to date. \nThere are some neat extras too. The Moto G5S Plus has a reasonably fast fingerprint scanner in the bezel below the screen, and a hybrid slot in the SIM tray to let you add to the 32GB of storage or an additional SIM card. \nThe fingerprint scanner can also be used to replace the on-screen soft keys. A left swipe is \u2018back\u2019, a right one brings up recent apps. This is just an option, you can turn it off. \nLike its predecessors, the Moto G5S Plus has a micro USB socket rather than a USB-C one, a move that seems a little out of date and will be positively archaic by the time the phone slips off shelves. \nThere\u2019s no full IP67/68 waterproofing, which lets a phone withstand being dunked in water, but it does have a water repelling nano coating to stop splashes shorting out the battery or killing the headphone jack. \nAs with other parts of the phone, you don\u2019t get everything, but you get enough. Screen Large and sharp 5.5-inch 1080p screen Customizable color profile Brightness levels can't keep up with Dubai sun \nLike the last few generations of Moto G, the Moto G5S Plus has a 1080p screen rather than an ultra-high resolution one. However, in person it\u2019s sharp despite the large 5.5-inch size. \nColor is very good too, although the IPS LCD panel isn\u2019t able to deliver the sort of super-saturated tones you\u2019ll see in an OLED phone. It\u2019s no great loss if you prefer accurate color, and there are two modes to let you tweak the tone. \nWhile viewing angles are great, the brightness levels don't go as high as some of the more expensive phones. Taking the Moto G5S Plus out in the sun, especially in the middle of the afternoon, can get hard to read. \nThe Moto G5S Plus\u2019s default Vibrant mode is the standard poppy look of a higher-quality phone screen, while \u2018standard\u2019 brings the tone closer to sRGB, the traditional palette for monitors. To our eyes it still appears very well-saturated, not the slightly low-energy look you get with a very strict sRGB mode. \nUnlike a lot of pricier phones, there\u2019s no major curvature to the screen, although the last millimeter or two does have a softened \u20182.5D\u2019 style edge. A fully curved look wouldn\u2019t really fit with the design anyway, which leaves the real curves to the aluminum. 1 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lenovo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motorola", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T14:38:47.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfde010d6f4d540baaa2286946ad1312e376a140", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3t1qWoE_hgr52V7yeu7AwIWQEz8efuKSxSK8khtnaxBS9xvXMORsDnA--", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/photography-video-capture", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - Photography & video capture news", "title": "The best digital cameras in 2017 | TechRadar", "title_full": "The best digital cameras in 2017 | TechRadar", "published": "2017-10-04T19:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGi7Bf9NaeBNJ2Mfnt7ySL-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 104, "comments": 0, "shares": 104}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfde010d6f4d540baaa2286946ad1312e376a140", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3t1qWoE_hgr52V7yeu7AwIWQEz8efuKSxSK8khtnaxBS9xvXMORsDnA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T19:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "The best digital cameras in 2017 | TechRadar", "text": "The best digital cameras in 2017 The best digital cameras in 2017 Our top nine standout cameras you can buy right now Shares \nOkay, we admit it \u2013 it's an impossible question. The best camera for a pro photographer is a million miles from the best camera for an adventure sports nut. So what we've done is pick out what we think are the standout cameras in their fields. This may be because they have the most amazing features and specifications, because they're amazing value for what they offer or because they are just brilliant at the job they've been designed for. \nAlong the way we'll explain some of the jargon and the differences between cameras, though if you need a bit more help deciding what kind of camera you need, you can get a lot more information from our special step-by-step guide: What camera should I buy? \nOn the other hand, you may already have a clear idea of the kind of camera you want, in which case you could go straight to one of our more specific camera buying guides: Best CSC/mirrorless camera \nLast year we saw some stunning cameras launched - many of them making it onto our list below.

Nikon D850 \nHigh resolution meets high speed \nType: DSLR | Sensor size: Full-frame CMOS | Resolution: 45.4MP | Lens: Nikon F mount | Viewfinder: Optical | Screen type: 3.2-inch tilting touchscreen, 2,359,000 dots | Maximum continuous shooting speed: 7fps | Movies: 4K | User level: Intermediate/expert Stunning image quality Slow Live View AF speed SnapBridge connectivity \nIt may be expensive, but if you're looking for the best camera money can buy right now, then Nikon's fabulous D850 DSLR pretty much ticks every box. Packing in a brilliant 45.4MP full-frame sensor, image quality is stunning. But that's just half the story. Thanks to a sophisticated 153-point AF system and 9fps burst shooting speed, the D850 is just a home shooting action and wildlife as it is landscapes and portraits. The Nikon D850 is perhaps the most well-rounded camera we've ever tested. \nRead our in-depth Nikon D850 review 2. Fujifilm X-T2 \nA stunning camera perfect for enthusiast photographers \nType: Mirrorless | Sensor size: APS-C CMOS | Resolution: 24.3MP | Lens: Fujifilm X mount | Viewfinder: EVF | Monitor: 3.0-inch tilt-angle display, 1,040,000 dots | Maximum continuous shooting speed: 8fps | Movies: 4K | User level: Intermediate/expert Polished handling No touchscreen Not much else \nThe update to the X-T1 may look similar at first glance, but there have been some huge improvements made to Fujifilm's follow-up flagship mirrorless camera. Perhaps the biggest update though is the autofocus. A huge leap forward compared with the system found in the X-T1, AF tracking of moving subjects is very snappy, while the level of sophistication and customisation is impressive. Add in 8 frames per second burst shooting, a clever double-hinged rear display, bright EVF, Fujifilm's excellent 24.3MP X Trans III CMOS sensor and plenty of body mounted controls and you're left with one of the best cameras available today. \nRead the full review: Fujifilm X-T2 3. Canon EOS 5D Mark IV \nOne of the most complete DSLRs we've seen \nType: DSLR | Sensor size: Full-frame CMOS | Resolution: 30.4MP | Lens: Canon EF mount | Viewfinder: Optical | Monitor: 3.2-inch touchscreen, 1,620,000 dots | Maximum continuous shooting speed: 7fps | Movies: 4K | User level: Expert Stunning performance Expensive compared to rivals 4K video options limited \nCanon's EOS 5D series of cameras has a rich heritage \u2013 the original EOS 5D bought full-frame DSLR photography to the masses, the Mark II unleashed Full HD video capture for the first time on a DSLR, and while the Mark III became a firm favourite amongst photographers. The EOS 5D Mark IV pretty much tweaks and improves on everything before it. With a new 30.4MP sensor that delivers pin-sharp results through the ISO range, a 61-point AF system that's incredibly advanced and some very polished handling, the EOS 5D Mark IV has to be one of the best DSLRs we've seen. \nRead the full review: Canon EOS 5D Mark IV 4. Sony Alpha A9 \nTaking the fight to Canon and Nikon \nType: Mirrorless | Sensor size: Full-frame CMOS | Resolution: 24.2MP | Lens: Sony E mount | Viewfinder: EVF | Screen type: 3.0-inch tilting touchscreen, 1440,000 dots | Maximum continuous shooting speed: 20fps | Movies: 4K | User level: Expert Blistering performance Limited touchscreen control No XQD card slots \nOnce, if you wanted a professional quality full frame camera it had to be a Nikon or Canon DSLR. Sony's growing range of mirrorless full-frame cameras offer a great alternative and the Alpha A9 sits at the top of the range. The AF system Sony has blessed this camera with is not only incredibly quick, the tracking performance needs to be seen to be believed. Partner that with incredibly fast 20fps burst shooting, and a large and bright EVF that doesn't blackout when you're shooting, and you've got a camera that can mix it with the best that Canon and Nikon have to offer when it comes to shooting action. The Alpha A9 doesn't fail to impress. 5. Sony Alpha A7R II \nSony's top mirrorless camera is a real show-stopper \nType: Mirrorless | Sensor size: Full-frame CMOS | Resolution: 42.4MP | Lens: Sony E mount | Viewfinder: EVF | Monitor: 3.0-inch tilt-angle display, 1,228,800 dots | Maximum continuous shooting speed: 5fps | Movies: 4K | User level: Expert Excellent resolution Relatively limited lens range Menus need streamlining \nOnce, if you wanted a professional quality full frame camera it had to be a Nikon or Canon DSLR. But Sony has changed all that with its mirrorless A7 series cameras, and the A7R II is its highest resolution model. Its 42.4 megapixel sensor is second only to the 50-megapixel sensor in the Canon EOS 5DS for resolution, yet the A7R II is only two-thirds the size and weight of the Canon. It has a high-resolution electronic viewfinder and 5-axis image stabilization built into the camera body, and the full-time live view that's integral to the mirrorless design gives Sony's A7-series cameras a real advantage for video. \nRead the full review: Sony Alpha A7R II 6. Nikon D3400 \nNot the most expensive entry-level DSLR, but we think it's the best \nType: DSLR | Sensor: APS-C CMOS | Resolution: 24.2MP | Lens: Nikon F mount (DX) | Viewfinder: Optical | Screen type: 3.0-inch screen, 921,000 dots | Maximum continuous shooting speed: 5fps | Movies: 1080p | User level: Beginner Good image quality Fixed screen No touchscreen \nNikon's D3400 builds on the brilliant D3300 and is our top pick when it comes to entry-level DSLRs. Sharing pretty much the same design and specification as its predecessor, the D3400 adds Nikon's SnapBridge bluetooth connectivity to transfer images directly to your smart device to make it that much easier to share images. The 24.2MP sensor resolves bags of detail, while the D3400 is also a very easy camera to live with. Its clever Guide Mode is a useful learning tool that gives real-time explanations of important features. There's no touchscreen, but otherwise, this is our favorite entry-level DSLR right now. \nRead our in-depth Nikon D3400 review 7. Fujifilm X100F \nClassic design and controls make it the perfect enthusiast compact \nType: High-end compact | Sensor: APS-C CMOS | Resolution: 24.3MP | Lens: 23mm f/2 | Monitor: 3-inch, 1,040,000 dots | Viewfinder: Hybrid | Maximum continuous shooting speed: 8fps | Movies: 1080p | User level: Expert Hybrid viewfinder ISO dial not that practical 1080p video only \nThe X100F is a thing of beauty both to look and and to use, but it's not for everyone. It's a relatively large, retro-styled compact camera with a fixed focal length 35mm equivalent f/2.0 lens, and designed for photographers who hanker after the weighty feel and manual external controls of traditional 35mm film rangefinder cameras. It's a relatively specialised camera and most owners are likely to have other cameras too. It may be a touch pricey, but there's nothing quite like it \u2013 it's an exquisite camera to look at and to shoot with. \nRead the full review: Fujifilm X100F 8. Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II \nTop-notch performance in a super-small package \nType: Mirrorless | Sensor size: MFT Live MOS | Resolution: 16.1MP | Lens: Micro Four Thirds | Screen type: 3.0-inch tilting touchscreen, 1,370,000 dots | Viewfinder: EVF | Maximum continuous shooting rate: 8.5fps | Movies: 1080p | User level: Beginner/enthusiast Compact proportions Smaller sensor than some Battery life could be better \nWe loved the original E-M10 for its size, versatility and value for money, but the E-M10 II adds features that take it to another level. The old camera's 3-axis image stabilization system has been uprated to the 5-axis system in Olympus's more advanced OM-D cameras, the viewfinder resolution has been practically doubled and the continuous shooting speed, already impressive at 8fps, creeps up to 8.5fps. Some will criticise the smaller Micro Four Thirds sensor format (roughly half the area of APS-C) but the effect on image quality is minor and it means that the lenses are as compact and lightweight as the camera itself. It's small, but it's no toy \u2013 the E-M10 II is a properly powerful camera. 9. Canon EOS Rebel T7i / 800D \nCanon's best entry-level DSLR yet offers power and performance \nType: DSLR | Sensor: APS-C CMOS | Resolution: 24.2MP | Lens: Canon EF-S | Viewfinder: Optical | Monitor: 3.0-inch vari-angle touchscreen, 1,040,000 dots | Maximum continuous shooting speed: 6fps | Movies: 1080p | User level: Beginner Polished handling Only 95% viewfinder coverage Plastic finish \nOne of the best entry-level DSLRs out there, the EOS Rebel T7i (known as the EOS 800D outside) is an update to the EOS Rebel T6i / 750D . The resolution stays the same, but it's a new design with an improved high ISO performance. The autofocus also gets a boost over the older model, now with a 45-point arrangement that's backed up by excellent live view AF system that's as quick as mirrorless rivals, while the newly designed graphical interface will certainly make this camera even more appealing to new users. The absence of 4K video and the quality of the exterior materials disappoint, but despite this the EOS Rebel T7i / 800D is a great entry into the world of DSLR photography. 10. Panasonic Lumix FZ2000 / FZ2500GA \nThe bridge camera for the photographer who wants quality too \nType: Bridge camera | Sensor: 1.0-inch type CMOS | Resolution: 20.1MP | Lens: 24-480mm, f/2.8-4.5 | Monitor: 3-inch articulating display, 1,040,000 dots | Viewfinder: EVF | Maximum continuous shooting speed: 12fps | Movies: 4K | User level: Intermediate/expert Large 1-inch sensor Big, heavy and not cheap No weather-sealing \nOur final camera is a 'bridge' camera, a type of camera that we don't normally like very much because the ultra-zoom design forces the makers to use titchy 1/2.3-inch sensors the same size as those in point-and-shoot cameras. You get the look and feel of a DSLR, but you certainly don't get the image quality. But the Panasonic Lumix FZ2000 (known as the FZ2500 in the US) is different. It sacrifices a huge zoom range in favour of a much larger 1.0-inch sensor - a compromise most serious photographers will applaud. While the zoom tops out at 480mm equivalent, which is relatively short for a bridge camera, that's still plenty for all but the most extreme everyday use. We'd certainly sacrifice a little for of zoom range for better and faster optics. We love the FZ2000 because it delivers both image quality and zoom range, while also offering full manual and semi-manual controls, the ability to shoot raw files and 4K video.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark iii", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon eos rebel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panasonic lumix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dslr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony alpha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon dslr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fujifilm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canon eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olympus", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T15:20:08.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03ca78922c631fd14f5c39b1410cea2a7d833527", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3rk3DfqJR4lfkLRO5twg84Yv3Z8VS6aJwNdubho3ex53y_B_f_5HIQ8KrNF.W2Wm5SpyxUfwKBso-", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://technewsblogs.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "Tech News Blogs", "title": "Nintendo 64 Classic Mini: what we want to see", "title_full": "Nintendo 64 Classic Mini: what we want to see", "published": "2017-10-04T15:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://technewsblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/i8zAYJy7Y9jt3o7avmqQDZ-1000x600.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03ca78922c631fd14f5c39b1410cea2a7d833527", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3rk3DfqJR4lfkLRO5twg84Yv3Z8VS6aJwNdubho3ex53y_B_f_5HIQ8KrNF.W2Wm5SpyxUfwKBso-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Shoung", "published": "2017-10-04T15:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nintendo 64 Classic Mini: what we want to see", "text": "Email \nWe\u2019ve already had the NES Mini and the SNES Mini\u2026 are you not entertained? Can your lust for retro revivalism never be sated? Of course not, and so, if Nintendo loves money as much as the next business, then it\u2019ll probably be carefully considering making an Nintendo 64 Classic Mini very soon. \nWith the SNES Mini now on shelves and in homes, selling out faster than mushrooms at a Mario party, it\u2019d make a lot of sense for Nintendo to turn its attentions to the next console in its storied history, the Nintendo 64, AKA the N64, and get it placed under the company\u2019s shrink ray. The original console in all its curvy glory. \nNintendo\u2019s first console capable of true 3D gaming, the Nintendo 64 was released in 1996, and went head-to-head with Sony\u2019s original PlayStation. Though it was the first time Nintendo\u2019s console crown began to look a little shaky on its head, it still laid claim to some of the greatest games of its generation \u2013 and certainly many N64 titles hold up better to modern scrutiny compared to their Sony counterparts. Super Mario 64 still impresses to this day. \nWhile its solid 3D visuals impressed, the console broke new ground in other areas, which still resonate strongly today, and helps it remain a relevant machine, ripe for revival. From its turn-on-a-dime analogue stick to its rumble-pak equipped controllers, the N64 may have had a relatively small game library, but its hits were stone cold. Will there be an N64 Mini? \nThere\u2019s evidence for and against it being Nintendo\u2019s next project. For starters, a trademark document was recently uncovered with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). Filing number 016991325 points to an image of a Nintendo 64 controller, showing the company legally suring up the defences of its trident-shaped pad for some future purpose. \nHowever, there\u2019s a few hurdles that Nintendo would have to jump in order to get the N64 Mini out onto shelves in a way that\u2019d make financial sense for the company, which could throw the whole enterprise into jeopardy. Related with MasterCard now has a fingerprint-protected card \nFirstly, the console itself is a more complex machine than the SNES and NES decks that preceded it. Its 3D graphics were more demanding, requiring more complex internal hardware, while it\u2019s controller was a bulky beast, which would require a more costly production run. It\u2019s worth noting that the SNES and NES Mini\u2019s also share the same internals, meaning that, software development aside, Nintendo merely needed to build a new shell to get the miniature Super Nintendo to market. Banjo-Kazooie would be a title potentially affected by the Rare licensing problem. \nAnd then on top of that, there\u2019s just the little tiny issue of the fact that (gulp)\u2026 Microsoft effectively owns the intellectual property behind some of the N64\u2019s best games. \nIn 2002, Microsoft bought British games company Rare, a key talent under Nintendo\u2019s wing during the N64 era. It was responsible for the likes of Donkey Kong 64, GoldenEye, Banjo-Kazooie and more of the console\u2019s classics. \nAs a result, getting these to the mini machine would be a complicated, and potentially costly process. And things get only more complicated with games like Rare\u2019s GoldenEye, or the fantastic Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, which are based on other existing licences. It\u2019s not going to be a straightforward build should Nintendo commit. A work-around for missing games? \nIf you\u2019re an intrepid gadget tinkerer, there may be hope for getting missing games onto any eventual N64 Mini \u2013 at least if the SNES and NES Mini consoles are anything to go by. \nHackers were easily able to get access to the inner workings of those existing consoles, and built a tool for putting ROMs and homebrew onto the little SNES and NES machines. Using ROMs is a bit of a legal grey area, as we\u2019ve discussed before. But in the case of the SNES Mini, there was the suggestion that the console\u2019s makers had considered this and were subtly turning a blind eye to it . Perhaps those with access to missing N64 Mini games will be able to do the same. Related with LinkedIn enhances Premium subscriptions to help you optimize your career What we want to see \nMore of the same, essentially! The SNES Mini added further refinements to the tiny console formula, and, with a few minor tweaks, the N64 Mini could see the form perfected. \nReturning features \nThere\u2019s plenty from the previous minis we\u2019d like to see making a comeback \u2013 the convenience of pre-installed games, modern connections like USB for power and HDMI for video and audio, as well as software save states and rewind functionality. Frames for 4:3 games displayed on widescreen are welcome too, as are filters to spruce up the ageing visuals. \nIn-console manuals \nCurrently, to view the manuals of the games on the existing mini consoles, you have to scan a QR code and be sent to a corresponding webpage. All that faff just won't do. Let\u2019s have the manuals \u2013 so often full of wonderful SNES-era artwork \u2013 baked into the console\u2019s storage itself, letting everyone revel in this rapidly disappearing artform. The \u201ctrident\u201d pad is still unique among game controllers. \nLonger cables (or wireless controllers) \nThe SNES Mini\u2019s controller cables may be significantly longer than the laughable NES Mini\u2019s, but they\u2019re still too short to sit on the other side of the room with and play. Let\u2019s make the N64 Mini\u2019s a good ten feet long, eh Nintendo? Or perhaps wireless and rechargeable straight out of the box? If cables are a necessity, a standardised connection such as USB, perhaps letting them work with other consoles or computers, would be appreciated too. \nConnectivity and online store \nThere\u2019s something quite nice about the fact the previous Mini\u2019s have been offline-only affairs. There\u2019s no Wi-Fi dropouts to worry about, no always-on connected requirements, no notifications to interrupt your sessions. But we\u2019d still like a (legal) way of getting more games on the machines. \nA Wi-Fi connection and dedicated N64 store front would be a welcome addition \u2013 and could offset the price of getting the afore-mentioned troublesome licensed games onto the console, if they were optional paid-for extras. Bluetooth for controllers would be useful, too. Alternatively\u2026 Related with Drivemode raises $6.5 million from Panasonic and others \nSupport for original cartridges \nNow, this would be convenient work around those licensing issues, wouldn\u2019t it? If you had the original carts, you could simply just plug them in \u2013 though it may make the machine a little less \u201cmini\u201d than its forebears. Perhaps a plug-and-play external accessory could add such support? GoldenEye 4-player splitscreen was a treat \u2013 so long as Oddjob was banned. \n4 player support \nWhat\u2019s an N64 without four-player support? It was perhaps the defining feature of the N64, being (for its day) the most accessible four-player machine out there. With four controller ports on the front, you simply plugged your pads in and were good to go \u2013 no need to faff about with multi-taps. However, size may be a constraining factor here, further reinforcing the need for wireless pads. \nA \u201cHome button\u201d \n\u2026or a controller button combo shortcut with the same effect. Having to get up and press the reset button every time you want to change game, as the current Minis require, is a bit of a pain, easily rectified by the addition of a Home button or command to jump back out to the main menu. N64 Mini \u2013 the games we want to see \nWith a smaller overall library of games, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the N64 Mini came with fewer packed in games than its predecessor, especially considering the licensing limitations. Ocarina of Time was considered the finest game in the Zelda series, until the Switch\u2019s Breath of the Wild was released. \nBut lets imagine in an ideal world it matched its predecessor's 21 pre-installed titles. Which would we want to see included?

You might be able to manage without a spreadsheet tool or something for making slideshows, but text documents are unavoidable. Thankfully, you don't need to splash out on a full Microsoft Office subscription; there are some superb word processors available to download and use completely free. \nHere we\u2019re looking at the very best word processors that can be used offline (particularly useful for distraction-free writing), but there are also several excellent browser-based tools to consider if you'd rather do your writing online. \nGoogle Docs is the most obvious choice, and has the advantage of saving your work automatically so you don\u2019t have to worry if your connection fails. It\u2019s also a good choice for collaborative working, and means you don\u2019t have to upload work to a separate cloud storage service. However, it has a limited selection of templates, there\u2019s no way to import content from other Google applications, and any online tool is going to be surrounded by distractions like social media. \nIf you'd prefer an offline word processor, read on \u2013 the perfect one is only a click away. \nA word processor with cloud storage and support for all text files Interface almost identical to Word Excellent file format support Free cloud storage \nIf you\u2019ve used a modern version of Microsoft Word, there\u2019ll be no learning curve when you switch to Writer \u2013 the word processing component of WPS Office Free. \nThis free word processor looks and behaves almost exactly like its premium counterpart, and even has its own equivalent of OneDrive , offering 1GB free cloud storage. \nIts selection of pre-installed templates gives you everything you need for common document types, and you can easily create your own for bespoke tasks. It\u2019s compatible with every text file format you can think of, including current and legacy versions of Microsoft Word dating back to Office 97. \nWPS Office Writer is supported by discrete ads, which can be removed by upgrading to the premium version, but they\u2019re barely noticeable and no features are locked behind a paywall. Overall, WPS Writer is very impressive, and in our opinion it\u2019s the best free word processor available to download today. \nWPS recently launched a free PDF to Word converter as well, which is a great companion to its word processor.

Why? Well, the various microbial flora and fauna that live on and in our bodies are essential to our continued existence . \nHowever, though there are good microbes there are also more harmful microbes; the kind that cause infections, food poisoning and other illnesses. As the balance between good and evil in any comic book universe will tell you, it's hard to have one set of these microbes without the other, which is going to be a problem on any future missions into space. \nWe know this thanks to the findings of a research team led by Petra Schwendner from the University of Edinburgh. Schwendner and his team examined the Mars500 project \u2013 a simulated spaceship that was inhabited for 17 months by a six-man crew of Russians from 2010 to 2011. Specifically, they studied how the populations of microorganisms changed during the experiment, both over time and in different areas of the craft. Long-term influence \n\"Until now, little was known about the influence of long-term confinement on the microorganisms that live inside habitats that may one day be used to travel to other planets, and whether the structure of the microbiota changes with time,\" said Schwendner. \nTheir results showed that confinement dramatically shaped the bacterial community on board the spacecraft. Different areas had specific bacterial signatures, with communal areas, sleep areas, the gym and the toilet having the greatest activity. The lowest numbers of bacteria were found in the medical module. \nThe most common bacteria were those associated with humans, like Bacillus and Staphylococcus. These were probably dispersed by the crew themselves and while they're rarely lethal, they can be associated with skin infections \u2013 particularly in people with compromised immune systems. \nThe good news, though, is that the team's cleaning schedule kept the worst of the microbes at bay. \n\"Although we located some microbial hotspots where the number of bacteria was much higher than in other areas,\" Schwender said, \"we were quite relieved to find that the overall bacterial counts were within the acceptable limits.\" Cleaning control \n\"Due to appropriate cleaning measures, the microbial community inside the habitat was under control at all times with no or little risk for the crew.\" \nUnfortunately disease isn't the only risk posed by microbes. \"In addition to potential health risks for the crew, some of these microorganisms could have a negative impact on spacecraft, as they grow on and might damage spacecraft material,\" explained Schwendner. \n\"To ensure the systems' stability, countermeasures may be required to avoid development of highly resistant, adapted microorganisms, and a complete loss of microbial diversity.\" \nThe full details of the study were published in the journal Microbiome .

And what it looks like is a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge . \nThere\u2019s a curved screen on the front, which according to previous rumors is a 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display (the same as the Galaxy S7 Edge), there are bezels above and below the screen, like the S7 Edge, and there\u2019s what appears to be a glass back, like the S7 Edge. Even the Nokia 9\u2019s camera is similarly positioned. \nWe can\u2019t be too critical of it though, as if you\u2019re going to imitate a phone the S7 Edge is a good choice, and there are quite a few differences too.

But these tests have all been carried out with a driver behind the wheel for safety. \nThe new plan is to take off the training wheels, and have the cars drive themselves without the safety person as early as this autumn. \nMost likely the tests will continue to be in Phoenix, thanks to its well-maintained roads, sparse population and favorable laws when it comes to self-driving cars. Hailing a robo-taxi \nObviously, if the test is a success Waymo will then look to bringing its ride-hailing driverless cars to more areas, so there's every possibility that your first ride in a driverless taxi could happen in the next couple of years. \nBefore that can happen, there will need to be conversations about regulation, and ironing out the kinks that are currently affecting self-driving cars, namely the dependence on humans for difficult decisions. \nAt present, when a Waymo vehicle is in a situation where it doesn\u2019t know what to do it will contact a human operator, who will tell it what to do. This makes sense in terms of limiting the amount of humans needed, as one person can potentially guide many vehicles. \nThe problem is, if a person doesn\u2019t respond immediately to the car\u2019s request, it could potentially be dangerous.

Thus, the Mi Mix 2 is going to play an important role in determining the market topography of Xiaomi in India. \nHere's what Manu Kumar Jain revealed on his Twitter handle- The wait is over.. #MiMIX2 is coming to India! Come Oct 10 and hail the Mi MIX 2 #TheOriginalX \uf60e @XiaomiIndia RT if you are excited \uf607 pic.twitter.com/ohsLuH9HkV October 4, 2017 Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 Specifications \nConnectivity-wise, the upcoming phone supports 4G LTE, VoLTE, dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, USB Type-C port, etc. A 3400mAh battery juices up the handset. \nComing to the specs, the Mi Mix 2 sports a 5.99-inch 18:9 Full HD+ (2160 x 1080) edge to edge display. The gorgeous IPS LCD panel is covered with a layer of Gorilla Glass 4. The front of the phone a piezoelectric earpiece, front camera and a range of sensors. The fingerprint scanner lies at the back. \nUnder the hood, the Mi Mix 2 packs the flagship Snapdragon 835 SoC which features in almost every 2017 flagship phone. Moving on to the memory department, there is at least 6GB of RAM and 64GB of high-end UFS 2.1 storage. Speaking of the software, the phone is loaded with Android 7.1.2 Nougat and MIUI 9 user interface. \nThere is a single 12 MP camera at the back of the Mi Mix 2. It is powered by the Sony IMX 386 sensor and features 1.25 um pixel size, f/2.0 aperture, 4-axis OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) and a dual LED flash. At the front, there is a standard 5 MP Selfie unit.

One of the thinnest laptops of its time to house full Intel Core processors, it cut a few too many corners in pursuit of that marquee \u2018thinnest laptop ever\u2019 moniker. Today, HP is poised to make good on that vision with a more refined Spectre 13 laptop, and the fruits of its labors are clear. \nSure, the new Spectre 13 houses all of the latest components, namely an 8th-generation Intel Core i7 processor and an FHD, IPS touchscreen to start, but it\u2019s the design revisions that surround those leading parts that work in this rendition\u2019s favor. Price and availability \nStarting at $1299 (about \u00a3978, AU$1,650), the new HP Spectre 13 is clearly a luxury laptop just like its predecessor. Specifically, that price gets you an Intel Core i7-8550U processor at 1.8GHz, a quad-core first for the laptop much less most others. Coupling that are 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM and a 256GB NVMe solid-state drive behind that 1080p Gorilla Glass display. \nUnless you\u2019re really craving a 4K display, which is optional, this laptop should deliver everything you need power-wise. As of this writing, HP hasn\u2019t disclosed how much the 4K version will cost, though pre-orders in the US begin on October 4, with shipping starting October 29. Design \nYou'll find HP\u2019s most pertinent improvements to the Spectre 13 in its look and feel. For starters, HP has narrowed the left and right bezels of the display even further, bringing the Spectre in line with the Dell XPS 13 or Lenovo Yoga 920 . \nNow, the device is cramming a 13.3-inch display into a frame that\u2019s just 12.13 inches wide and merely 0.41 inches thin, not to mention the fact that it weighs only 2.45 pounds. Yet, the keyboard and trackpad are larger than before by a considerable margin \u2013 how\u2019s that? \nWell, HP has managed to reposition the speakers above the keyboard deck, allowing for an expansion of the keyboard to include page control keys on the right side. On a slightly unrelated note, HP widened the trackpad in response to user feedback \u2013 both are welcome improvements. Keyboard travel has also been improved slightly both in terms of depth and feedback, which is always a plus in laptops this incredibly thin. \nBetter yet, not only has HP introduced a ceramic white lid and base color \u2013 using a complex process known as \u2018at-once electro disposition\u2019 to bond the paint to the metal \u2013 in addition to the standard \u2018ash silver,\u2019 but the firm has dropped the chrome accents in favor of brushed aluminum. Smudgy fingerprints, begone! \nHP has also tapered the edges of both the laptop's lid and base with a diamond cutting process, making the device easier to open from nearly any angle. Last year's model had flush edges, making this vastly more difficult. \nHowever, we\u2019re a bit bummed to see that HP hasn\u2019t improved upon the port offering, still putting forth two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports and one USB 3.1 Type-C port (in addition to a 3.5mm audio jack). Sure, these ports are versatile, but the rest of the tech world has yet to catch up to this new standard, which means dongle life continues. Just one USB Type-A port would be a godsend at this point. \nThat said, the inclusion of a Full HD webcam (with IR for Windows Hello) is all but unheard of in most laptops and a hugely welcome inclusion. Of course, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 provide all the wireless connectivity you\u2019ll need. Performance and battery life \nWhile we didn\u2019t have much time with the Spectre 13 to test its mettle, HP promises a 50% gain in performance over the previous generation. But, that\u2019s not all thanks to Intel\u2019s jump from dual-core to quad-core U Series processors, we\u2019re told. \nHP claims to have vastly improved the thermals in this year\u2019s Spectre 13, allowing its engineers to draw some extra wattage from the 8th-generation Intel Core i7 than it was able to from last year\u2019s chip. These improved thermals amount to larger heat pipes and a new, \u2018smart\u2019 cooling system that only activates the fans when necessary. \nThis enhancement, in turn, has afforded HP another half-hour of battery life from the Spectre 13, bringing it up to a total of 11 hours and 15 minutes. This is in addition to the fact that HP is now employing a \u2018sliced battery\u2019 strategy inside, which has allowed it to get 43.7Whr of juice into the machine. However, considering last year\u2019s model lasted just 5 hours and 33 minutes at most in our testing, we\u2019ll be the judge of these claims in a full review. \nFinally, we were taken aback at just how deeply HP has improved the audio in the new Spectre 13. By moving the audio chambers closer to the Bang & Olufsen speaker row and increasing the amount of discrete amplifiers, music is far more full and nuanced than before. It was so impressive that we could listen to tunes straight from the laptop \u2013 no headphones needed. Early verdict \nHP appears to have vastly improved the Spectre 13 on nearly all fronts. Not only is the device narrower than before while maintaining the same thinness and weight, its bezels are all but nil and the nasty chrome accent fingerprint magnets are gone. \nThe laptop\u2019s thermals are improved and a touchscreen comes standard now, not to mention that new ceramic white color is just plain gorgeous. However, we\u2019d have liked to see HP somehow get a USB-A port into the thing, but by next year this could well be a moot point. \nAll in all, it\u2019s clear that HP has not only listened closely to reviews but the feedback of customers too, as nearly all of our bugbears with the previous version of Spectre 13 have been addressed in this model. From a design standpoint, the difference between this year and last is night and day. Now all that remains is to put this thing through the gauntlet, so stay tuned.

You also get integrated graphics courtesy of Intel UHD Graphics 620. \nThe notebook has a 13.3-inch Gorilla Glass touchscreen with vanishingly small \u2018micro-edge\u2019 bezels and a Full HD resolution (with an option on a 4K screen). HP is further claiming that this is the world\u2019s thinnest touchscreen-equipped laptop at 10.4mm \u2013 so it\u2019s not just the bezels that are sleek, but the entire chassis. \nThe claimed battery life of the notebook is up to 11.5 hours (of video playback), and HP has also introduced fast-charge technology that can juice up the battery from empty to 50% in just 30 minutes. \nThe Spectre 13 benefits from a full-size edge-to-edge backlit keyboard, with a pair of Bang & Olufsen speakers placed above it to deliver what HP promises is crisp sound. \nConnectivity includes a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports, a USB Type-C 3.1 Gen 1 connector, and a headphone/mic combo jack. Private convertible \nMoving on to the Spectre x360 13 convertible (pictured above and below), like the aforementioned Spectre 13, this also boasts a choice of Intel\u2019s 8th-gen Core i5 or i7 CPUs, backed with up to 16GB of RAM and up to a 1TB PCIe SSD. It has a 360-degree hinge allowing for use in four different modes (laptop, tablet, stand, tent). \nYou get a 13.3-inch IPS touchscreen with the same super-thin bezels as the Spectre 13, and again that can be up to a 4K resolution display. \nHP claims that the Spectre x360 offers the best battery life out there when it comes to quad-core 2-in-1s, lasting for up to 16.5 hours (depending on the exact configuration you go for, and as ever, your mileage will likely vary when it comes to battery longevity). \nThis machine also benefits from HP\u2019s fast charge technology allowing for the notebook to go from empty to a 90% charge in 90 minutes. \nThere are some nifty security features here, including a fingerprint reader, infrared camera for facial recognition, and the option for a built-in privacy screen (with the Full HD model, not the 4K display). \nThe latter is invoked at the touch of a button, and darkens the screen for those viewing from the side at an angle, meaning that nosy-parkers sat next to you won\u2019t be able to make out what you\u2019re typing in that private email (or that\u2019s the theory, anyway). \nBoth of these refreshed HP notebooks hit the shelves on October 29, with the HP Spectre starting at $1,300 (around \u00a3980, AU$1,650), and the Spectre x360 13 weighing in at $1,150 (around \u00a3870, AU$1,460) for the most basic configuration. Will these new HP notebooks make the cut for our best laptops list?

Big battery and suspect SIM \nThe Pixel 2 XL\u2019s battery is supposedly 3,520mAh, which we\u2019ve heard before , and other listed specs and features include 64GB of storage, a fingerprint scanner and an 8MP front-facing camera with an f/2.4 aperture, which is slightly different from the 7MP one we\u2019ve heard about in other leaks . \nInterestingly, there\u2019s also mention of an e-SIM, which we\u2019ve heard before but were skeptical of. This could theoretically let you change network without changing SIM card, but a standard nanoSIM slot is also listed, so even if this is accurate we suspect most networks will make you use that one. \nThe Pixel 2 XL is listed here as being in \u2018Just Black\u2019, though we\u2019re sure other colors will be available. The only significant spec not listed is the rear camera, but previous leaks suggest this will be 12MP. \nIt\u2019s hard to say how accurate this listing is, though Quandt has a solid track record. In any case, we\u2019ll know soon, as the Pixel 2 XL is being announced today at 9AM PST/12PM EST/5PM BST or 3AM AEDT on October 5 and we\u2019ll bring you all the information as soon as we have it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roland quandt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quandt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google pixel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qualcomm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pixel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:41:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e84f9cbba3eafd04a6e4d8f90f3ff7f123b28a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3DUB8KJOOiehHorNMKM1X8JK9t03F3OpAxod9WpzxIew5Zkvl2gmd9qWiZuqFJv5.i8AwJFaJFANIhBl_KDX7eVEDLTo71PX2", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - All the latest technology news", "title": "Here\u2019s why having an Amazon Prime subscription is a good idea", "title_full": "Here\u2019s why having an Amazon Prime subscription is a good idea", "published": "2017-10-04T15:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2aXUxcsySgGxaycbbae4Qk-1200-80.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 10, "comments": 0, "shares": 10}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e84f9cbba3eafd04a6e4d8f90f3ff7f123b28a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3DUB8KJOOiehHorNMKM1X8JK9t03F3OpAxod9WpzxIew5Zkvl2gmd9qWiZuqFJv5.i8AwJFaJFANIhBl_KDX7eVEDLTo71PX2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rounak Jain", "published": "2017-10-04T15:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here\u2019s why having an Amazon Prime subscription is a good idea", "text": "Here\u2019s why having an Amazon Prime subscription is a good idea Here\u2019s why having an Amazon Prime subscription is a good idea Be a Prime member now Shares \nAs most of you know, Amazon Great Indian Festival sale is live from today onwards.

This verifies that the VPN tunnel is enabled, and that your real IP address is successfully cloaked by the VPN. \nEven if this is confirmed, bear in mind that the test has been carried out at a single point in time. Any computer user knows that getting something to work once can be a challenge, but is certainly not the same as having it work day in and day out with 24/7 uptime. In other words, even the best VPN can\u2019t be guaranteed 100% secure, and even with leak protection enabled, your IP address can be exposed, if only for brief intervals. \nOne common issue with a VPN connection is when the user overloads it with traffic, initiating a temporary disconnect, and then when the service reconnects, the computer does this directly, without the VPN enabled \u2013 which is known as a reconnection leak. \nThe other concern here is that the user is typically oblivious to this issue as the PC and the VPN appear to be functioning normally, and there is no indication of any flaw \u2013 short of repeating the IP leak test \u2013 to reveal that the user\u2019s IP address is not hidden. \nEvery problem has a solution, and the fix for these VPN hiccups is known as a kill switch, and they come in two varieties. Some of the better VPN providers integrate a VPN kill switch directly into their service. This is a feature to look for when selecting a provider, as it really is a must-have these days. \nWhen the VPN service\u2019s software discovers that the VPN tunnel is no longer providing privacy protection, the kill switch then kicks in with the swiftness of an overloaded circuit breaker in an electrical panel, and terminates all connections to prevent the exchange of unencrypted data. Examples of VPNs that offer an integrated kill switch are NordVPN , IPVanish and AirVPN, among others we highlight below. We\u2019ve also debunked 6 common myths concerning VPNs \nHow about if you already have a VPN that you are otherwise satisfied with, and you\u2019ve only just realized that it doesn\u2019t have an integrated kill switch, after paying for an annual subscription? Or perhaps your VPN software has an integrated kill switch, but you are a \u2018belt and suspenders\u2019 kind of computer user who wants a backup, just in case. Hey, we don\u2019t blame you, and fret not, the functionality of a VPN kill switch can easily be added via a software solution that monitors the connection, and then kills it if the VPN tunnel is compromised. \nRead on for some great and affordable (or even free) choices below, whether you want a standalone kill switch, or a VPN which boasts an integrated effort (or indeed both). 1. VPN Watcher \nVPN Watcher is a lightweight piece of software. It\u2019s a VPN kill switch which is available in three tiers: Free, Personal and Gold. The main difference between these options is that the paid versions check the connection more frequently, and support more simultaneous applications. \nA limiting factor, as seen in the screenshot above, is that VPN Watcher supports only a half dozen VPN services directly, and otherwise requires a more labor intensive and painful manual configuration. 2. VPNetMon \nVPNetMon has only one tier for its kill switch software \u2013 and the good news is that it\u2019s a free offering. It also works with a wide variety of VPN software. While those are the points in favor of this app, disadvantages include the fact that it does take some time and tweaking to configure, and can be a little buggy. The software can support up to three VPN applications. 3. VPNCheck \nVPNCheck is another lightweight piece of software, and it comes in two versions: Free and Pro. While both offer a kill switch that gets activated if the VPN crashes, only VPNCheck Pro also has a DNS Leak Fix feature. Both versions are simple apps that are easy to configure and use. 4. Comodo Firewall \nComodo Firewall is a well-known free firewall that\u2019s popular with the open source crowd. We\u2019ve recently reviewed the product and awarded it four stars to boot. While its primary focus is firewall duty, which the software does seriously well, it is quite robust and configurable to various other purposes. \nIn fact, for more advanced users willing to delve deeper into the settings, Comodo Firewall can be set up to function as a VPN kill switch. This involves going into the Global Rules menu, and setting up a series of rules that will block the IP address from being revealed.

Amidst the many VPNs on the market these days, LiquidVPN stands out for two features. The first is that LiquidVPN claims to have a \u2018zero logs DNS service\u2019 (LiquidDNS) meaning that it doesn\u2019t keep any of the DNS requests that users make. \nThe other standout element is that LiquidVPN has integrated a VPN kill switch into its software: \u2018Liquid Lock\u2019. This will allegedly stop all types of leaks, including DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks, disconnect leaks, and IPv6 leaks. 6. HideMyAss \nAnother VPN that has an integrated kill switch is HideMyAss , a service brought to you by AVG of antivirus fame. When TechRadar Pro reviewed this provider last year, we noted that HideMyAss benefits from a large network of servers, and it\u2019s very easy to use (albeit not cheap). \nAnother plus of HideMyAss for less tech-savvy types who don\u2019t want to attempt to configure a kill switch is that this provider has one built directly into the software client. The firm calls it \u2018Secure IP Bind,\u2019 and it functions by forcing selected applications to only work when connected to the VPN servers. If the VPN gets interrupted, the apps will no longer work, and the IP leak is avoided.

Can your lust for retro revivalism never be sated? Of course not, and so, if Nintendo loves money as much as the next business, then it\u2019ll probably be carefully considering making an Nintendo 64 Classic Mini very soon. \nWith the SNES Mini now on shelves and in homes, selling out faster than mushrooms at a Mario party, it\u2019d make a lot of sense for Nintendo to turn its attentions to the next console in its storied history, the Nintendo 64, AKA the N64, and get it placed under the company\u2019s shrink ray. The original console in all its curvy glory. \nNintendo\u2019s first console capable of true 3D gaming, the Nintendo 64 was released in 1996, and went head-to-head with Sony\u2019s original PlayStation. Though it was the first time Nintendo\u2019s console crown began to look a little shaky on its head, it still laid claim to some of the greatest games of its generation \u2013 and certainly many N64 titles hold up better to modern scrutiny compared to their Sony counterparts. Super Mario 64 still impresses to this day. \nWhile its solid 3D visuals impressed, the console broke new ground in other areas, which still resonate strongly today, and helps it remain a relevant machine, ripe for revival. From its turn-on-a-dime analogue stick to its rumble-pak equipped controllers, the N64 may have had a relatively small game library, but its hits were stone cold. Will there be an N64 Mini? \nThere\u2019s evidence for and against it being Nintendo\u2019s next project. For starters, a trademark document was recently uncovered with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). Filing number 016991325 points to an image of a Nintendo 64 controller, showing the company legally suring up the defences of its trident-shaped pad for some future purpose. \nHowever, there\u2019s a few hurdles that Nintendo would have to jump in order to get the N64 Mini out onto shelves in a way that\u2019d make financial sense for the company, which could throw the whole enterprise into jeopardy. \nFirstly, the console itself is a more complex machine than the SNES and NES decks that preceded it. Its 3D graphics were more demanding, requiring more complex internal hardware, while it\u2019s controller was a bulky beast, which would require a more costly production run. It\u2019s worth noting that the SNES and NES Mini\u2019s also share the same internals, meaning that, software development aside, Nintendo merely needed to build a new shell to get the miniature Super Nintendo to market. Banjo-Kazooie would be a title potentially affected by the Rare licensing problem. \nAnd then on top of that, there\u2019s just the little tiny issue of the fact that (gulp)... Microsoft effectively owns the intellectual property behind some of the N64\u2019s best games. \nIn 2002, Microsoft bought British games company Rare, a key talent under Nintendo\u2019s wing during the N64 era. It was responsible for the likes of Donkey Kong 64, GoldenEye, Banjo-Kazooie and more of the console\u2019s classics. \nAs a result, getting these to the mini machine would be a complicated, and potentially costly process. And things get only more complicated with games like Rare\u2019s GoldenEye, or the fantastic Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, which are based on other existing licences. It\u2019s not going to be a straightforward build should Nintendo commit. A work-around for missing games? \nIf you\u2019re an intrepid gadget tinkerer, there may be hope for getting missing games onto any eventual N64 Mini \u2013 at least if the SNES and NES Mini consoles are anything to go by. \nHackers were easily able to get access to the inner workings of those existing consoles, and built a tool for putting ROMs and homebrew onto the little SNES and NES machines. Using ROMs is a bit of a legal grey area, as we\u2019ve discussed before. But in the case of the SNES Mini, there was the suggestion that the console\u2019s makers had considered this and were subtly turning a blind eye to it . Perhaps those with access to missing N64 Mini games will be able to do the same. What we want to see \nMore of the same, essentially! The SNES Mini added further refinements to the tiny console formula, and, with a few minor tweaks, the N64 Mini could see the form perfected. \nReturning features \nThere\u2019s plenty from the previous minis we\u2019d like to see making a comeback \u2013 the convenience of pre-installed games, modern connections like USB for power and HDMI for video and audio, as well as software save states and rewind functionality. Frames for 4:3 games displayed on widescreen are welcome too, as are filters to spruce up the ageing visuals. \nIn-console manuals \nCurrently, to view the manuals of the games on the existing mini consoles, you have to scan a QR code and be sent to a corresponding webpage. All that faff just won't do. Let\u2019s have the manuals \u2013 so often full of wonderful SNES-era artwork \u2013 baked into the console\u2019s storage itself, letting everyone revel in this rapidly disappearing artform. The \"trident\" pad is still unique among game controllers. \nLonger cables (or wireless controllers) \nThe SNES Mini\u2019s controller cables may be significantly longer than the laughable NES Mini\u2019s, but they\u2019re still too short to sit on the other side of the room with and play. Let\u2019s make the N64 Mini\u2019s a good ten feet long, eh Nintendo? Or perhaps wireless and rechargeable straight out of the box? If cables are a necessity, a standardised connection such as USB, perhaps letting them work with other consoles or computers, would be appreciated too. \nConnectivity and online store \nThere\u2019s something quite nice about the fact the previous Mini\u2019s have been offline-only affairs. There\u2019s no Wi-Fi dropouts to worry about, no always-on connected requirements, no notifications to interrupt your sessions. But we\u2019d still like a (legal) way of getting more games on the machines. \nA Wi-Fi connection and dedicated N64 store front would be a welcome addition \u2013 and could offset the price of getting the afore-mentioned troublesome licensed games onto the console, if they were optional paid-for extras. Bluetooth for controllers would be useful, too. Alternatively\u2026 \nSupport for original cartridges \nNow, this would be convenient work around those licensing issues, wouldn\u2019t it? If you had the original carts, you could simply just plug them in \u2013 though it may make the machine a little less \u201cmini\u201d than its forebears. Perhaps a plug-and-play external accessory could add such support? GoldenEye 4-player splitscreen was a treat \u2013 so long as Oddjob was banned. \n4 player support \nWhat\u2019s an N64 without four-player support? It was perhaps the defining feature of the N64, being (for its day) the most accessible four-player machine out there. With four controller ports on the front, you simply plugged your pads in and were good to go \u2013 no need to faff about with multi-taps. However, size may be a constraining factor here, further reinforcing the need for wireless pads. \nA \u201cHome button\u201d \n...or a controller button combo shortcut with the same effect. Having to get up and press the reset button every time you want to change game, as the current Minis require, is a bit of a pain, easily rectified by the addition of a Home button or command to jump back out to the main menu. N64 Mini - the games we want to see \nWith a smaller overall library of games, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the N64 Mini came with fewer packed in games than its predecessor, especially considering the licensing limitations. Ocarina of Time was considered the finest game in the Zelda series, until the Switch's Breath of the Wild was released. \nBut lets imagine in an ideal world it matched its predecessor's 21 pre-installed titles. Which would we want to see included? These ones: \nSuper Mario 64 \nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time \nThe Legend of Zelda: Majora\u2019s Mask \nMario Kart 64 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donkey kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banjo-kazooie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zelda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mario kart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mario", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "snes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rogue squadron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union intellectual property office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "super mario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "super nintendo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:41:28.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "036f0747e9d1c9b32dcf4be2a2f4bccb7b2e3f64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG31iOxV8_IrFKyde2yEv7CAbToo6ud7NnnsHqMdBhOrPqCeDsWKfWqbGNEkkQEU.LQPMfayqR9m3ZC2zeo1_ootHIuLAN7IbhqAQ2WE5bq5q4-", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - All the latest technology news", "title": "Horizon Zero Dawn is going for gold at this year\u2019s Golden Joystick Awards", "title_full": "Horizon Zero Dawn is going for gold at this year\u2019s Golden Joystick Awards", "published": "2017-10-04T14:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h7tFmBCV9VkR7Py6Wdfby4-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 8, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "036f0747e9d1c9b32dcf4be2a2f4bccb7b2e3f64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG31iOxV8_IrFKyde2yEv7CAbToo6ud7NnnsHqMdBhOrPqCeDsWKfWqbGNEkkQEU.LQPMfayqR9m3ZC2zeo1_ootHIuLAN7IbhqAQ2WE5bq5q4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emma Boyle", "published": "2017-10-04T14:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Horizon Zero Dawn is going for gold at this year\u2019s Golden Joystick Awards", "text": "Horizon Zero Dawn is going for gold at this year\u2019s Golden Joystick Awards Horizon Zero Dawn is going for gold at this year\u2019s Golden Joystick Awards More like Horizon Eight Nominations Shares \nDubbed the \u201cbiggest publicly-voted video game awards ceremony on the planet\u201d, the Golden Joystick Awards are back for their 35th year.

If you check off all the game\u2019s achievements you might, apparently unlock never-before-seen-footage of season 2. \nGiven that\u2019s coming at the end of this month and there's around 10 hours of gameplay, 7 playable characters to choose from, 6 Dungeons and over 30 quests here you\u2019ll probably want to crack on. \nAccording to the game\u2019s official blurb, those born after 1984 \u201cmight want to start with Normal difficulty\u201d to explore a their own pace. Those used to the excruciating difficult of games from the 80s, though, will be drawn to the \u201csoul-crushing\u201d classic mode. \nA nice touch is that Netflix and the developers aren't planning to abandon the game after the second season of the show premiers. In fact, when the new episodes go up, the game will be updateds with new content and characters. \nStranger Things: The Game has been developed by Texas studio BonusXP, Inc. and published by Netflix. You can download it for free on Google Play or iTunes right now.

Many of the big names in PC security provides tools that will release your PC from ransomware and don\u2019t charge for the privilege. There are also dedicated tools to prevent programs that behaves like known ransomware from running on your PC at all. \nBefore you get started, it's useful to recognize that there are two main types of ransomware: the kind that encrypts your files and threatens to delete them unless you pay a fee (like WannaCry), and the kind that locks you out completely by preventing you reaching your desktop. Thankfully, there are free tools to combat both types. \nIf you haven't yet fallen victim to a ransomware attack and want to protect your PC proactively, consider a dedicated prevention tool like ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware , which uses behavioral analysis to identify processes that act like ransomware \u2013 even if it's not yet a specific known threat \u2013 and automatically backs up your files if it detects anything. It carries a subscription fee, so we haven't included it in our main roundup, but $1.99 per month for one PC is a modest fee compared to the ransoms charged by criminals. \nSolutions designed to defeat different strains of ransomware Step-by-step guidance Tackles 21 forms of ransomware Frequently updated \nNot all ransomware encrypts data in the same way, so security software providers have to create specific solutions as new threats emerge. At the time of writing, the security experts at Avast have developed Free Ransomware Decryption Tools to tackle 21 different strains of file-locking ransomware. \nTo help you work out which one you need, Avast has provided a detailed description of how each form of ransomware works, what extension you\u2019ll see on the encrypted files, and an example of the type of message the virus creators have prepared for their victims. \nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded the appropriate tool, it will guide you through the process of wiping out the ransomware without paying the criminals. You\u2019ll need to provide two versions of the same file \u2013 an encrypted one, and the original. \nThis will be easiest if you made a backup before the infection, but Avast also suggests locations where you might be able to find unaffected original files. The tool will then compare the two and use the results to determine the password.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avast", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "avast", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T17:11:23.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b8ea56f7d6a871fd56158a8c0fed0f793b475f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3WVrkpvdrAoR3qiOwY2XEx_irsnjmFBO35rcLsXcy1UqLzlMKPdNG77c96YLjspXYX7nIz16WM4xDFUTmm6UCEU7z4mR60YkHNGk9jr8_8tEdtyZdZWq9LA--", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://techradar.com//rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - All the latest technology news", "title": "Sonos One announced: the long-promised Alexa smart speaker is finally official", "title_full": "Sonos One announced: the long-promised Alexa smart speaker is finally official", "published": "2017-10-04T17:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5mFadwHAhStt98qUhbaJEL-1200-80.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 25, "comments": 0, "shares": 25}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6b8ea56f7d6a871fd56158a8c0fed0f793b475f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3WVrkpvdrAoR3qiOwY2XEx_irsnjmFBO35rcLsXcy1UqLzlMKPdNG77c96YLjspXYX7nIz16WM4xDFUTmm6UCEU7z4mR60YkHNGk9jr8_8tEdtyZdZWq9LA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jon Porter", "published": "2017-10-04T17:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sonos One announced: the long-promised Alexa smart speaker is finally official", "text": "Shares \nAfter months of waiting, Sonos's long promised Alexa-powered smart speaker has finally been announced. \nCalled the Sonos One, the smart speaker integrates with Amazon's Alexa voice assistant via a dedicated Sonos Alexa skill. Interestingly, the company also announced that the speaker is also set to receive Google Assistant support later, in 2018. \nThe voice control means you'll not only be able to control music playback, but you'll also be able to access all of Alexa's other functionality such as controlling your smart home and getting weather reports. \nSince this is a Sonos speaker after all, it will also be able to integrate with any other Sonos equipment you have to get music playing throughout your home. You can pair two together to create stereo sound, add a Sonos Sub or integrate them with an existing Sonos-based home cinema setup. Long-promised \nThe speaker is based on Sonos's existing Play:1 which we were seriously impressed with when we reviewed it. The Sonos One features the same Class-D amplifiers and custom drivers. There are also touch controls on the device to control music playback directly. \nOther features include the ability to turn down the music when the Sonos One is listening to your voice commands through its six microphone array. AirPlay 2 will also be supported via a software update next year. \nTo limit privacy concerns, the speaker has a light that's hard-wired to the microphone so that you can be sure it's not listening to you when you don't want it to. \nThe speaker will be available in either black or white finishes when it goes on sale on October 24 for $199 (\u00a3199) with pre-orders starting today. \nIn addition to the new speaker, Sonos has also announced that Alexa can be used to control its existing lineup of speakers. The Beta for this service starts today . \nSonos first indicated it was working on an Alexa-powered speaker back in August 2016. A change to its privacy statement back in August 2017 indicated we'd see the smart speaker soon, before just one week ago pictures of the speaker appeared in the wild . \nWe'll be interested to see how the speaker performs when we get it in for a full review. If Sonos can combine its excellent audio chops with the intelligence of Alexa it might have a great little speaker on its hands.

Also, \u2018enhanced AR\u2019 hardware (which is what CCS calls mixed reality devices) like HoloLens will start to cause ripples in the market in 2018 (in terms of both consumers and enterprise), leading to further growth the following year. \nCCS Insight analyst George Jijiashvili observed: \u201cEnhanced AR devices like Microsoft's HoloLens and Magic Leap's upcoming solution will [begin] to affect the market, although the volume will initially be small and will only start building after 2019.\u201d \nAt that point, sales could be pushed further by the next-gen HoloLens \u2013 should it be ready by then . Smart glasses \nThe prediction for 2021 is that 8.6 million AR devices will be shipped in total, and of these, 7.1 million will be smart glasses, with the remaining 1.5 million being enhanced AR devices. Almost half of all this hardware will be sold to businesses. \nJijiashvili noted: \u201cAR will generate 26% of the [VR and AR] market value despite contributing only 9% of the volume. Again, this is because of their higher ASP, which will be supported particularly by enhanced AR devices largely targeted at enterprises.\u201d \nCCS further predicted that total shipments of VR and AR devices will hit 99 million units in 2021, for total sales of almost $12 billion (\u00a39 billion). \nFor this year, the analyst firm forecasts that 16 million VR and AR devices will ship by the close of 2017, which is a more than healthy yearly growth of 47%. The vast majority of those shipped devices will be VR, and (cheaper) smartphone-based VR products at that \u2013 13 million of them.

Unlike raster graphics (which you\u2019re more likely to use Paint.NET or GIMP for), vector graphics use mathematical expressions to draw the lines, shapes and colours. This means they\u2019re infinitely scalable, so you can blow them up to the size of a billboard with no unsightly pixellation. \nVector graphics are the best choice for a number of design and illustration tasks, such as creating icons, logos, diagrams, charts, posters and website graphics. In the latter case, the current standard is Scalable Vector Graphics format (SVG). \nAdobe Illustrator is the industry standard tool for vector graphics, but it's undeniably expensive and many people have been turned off by its move to a subscription payment model as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud. This has led to a renewed interest in alternatives such CorelDRAW, Sketch or Affinity Designer, all of which involve just a one-off fee. \nBut if your needs are relatively simple, then you can save even more money by trying out alternatives to Illustrator that are totally free \u2013 and there are some brilliant options to choose from. \nExample vector files designed by Freepik \nA feature-packed editor that's a true substitute for Illustrator Comprehensive toolkit Frequent updates Performance can be sluggish \nOpen source vector graphics package Inkscape is staggeringly powerful, and is the best free alternative to Adobe Illustrator for pro and semi-pro illustrators, graphic designers and web designers. \nAs well as the standard drawing and shape tools, Inkscape boasts a special spirals tool, a tool to create patterns and arrangements of clones, advanced object manipulation options, multiple filters (including bevels, textures, overlays and more), and some nifty fill settings. In short, there\u2019s very little Illustrator can do that Inkscape can\u2019t. \nBecause it's open source, it\u2019s not only free to use but if you have the technical know-how you can even edit it and incorporate it into other software. And new features are being added all the time; the latest version brings mesh gradients, improved SVG2 and CSS3 support and new path effects to the party. \nSo what\u2019s the catch? Some users have complained that it performs slowly, although that does seem to depend on what device and operating system you\u2019re using. The best thing to do is just download it and give it a quick try; there's nothing to lose. \nReview and where to download: Inkscape \nA browser-based vector editor that's as powerful as a desktop app Good format support Convenient browser extension Easy to use \nBoxy SVG is a free tool for creating scalable vector graphic files that runs as an extension in Google Chrome. It comes with a good range of basic tools, including pens, bezier curves, text, basic shapes, stroke and fill, layers, ability to add type, groups, transforms and paths. \nThe main selling point for Boxy SVG is the utter simplicity of its UI. It makes a virtue of paring down the experience of creating vector graphics to a fairly minimal set of options. These essentially restrict you to the kind of things that the SVG format is good at. As a result, it\u2019s fast, easier to pick up than Illustrator, and the files it creates are clean and efficient. \nAs well as importing and exporting files in SVG and SVGZ format, you can also use Boxy SVG to import and export JPEGs and PNGs. Wonderfully convenient. \nTry it online: BoxySVG \nGet a complete vector-editing suite in your favorite web browser Cross-platform Frequent updates Fewer features than Illustrator \nGravit offers many of Illustrator's key features right in your browser, so there\u2019s nothing to download and you can access your designs from a range of devices, wherever there\u2019s an internet connection. \nOnce you've signed up for an account, you can run the editor in Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Opera \u2013 or any derivative thereof. \nGravit\u2019s basic vector toolset includes Pen, Line, Knife, Slice and Bezigon tools. You can create shapes including rectangles, ellipses, triangles, polygons, and stars, plus there are layers, auto-shapes, live filters and path editing modes. There are also good typography tools, paste-inside support, all wrapped up in a well designed interface. \nYou can export your graphics in JPG, PNG, or SVG format, or save your work online and retrieve it later. \nGravit might not be as powerful or feature-rich as Illustrator, but it's a very capable alternative, and its browser-based nature gives it an edge. \nTry it online: Gravit \nA slimline vector editor available for your browser or desktop Intuitive interface Easy to master Lacks some advanced features \nVectr is a free cross-platform program that you can use used to create and edit vector graphics, either on your desktop (versions are available for Windows, Mac, Linux and ChromeOS), or in any modern browser. \nVectr is intuitive to use, with a shallow learning curve. \u201cDesign software shouldn\u2019t bring people a sense of struggle, yet that\u2019s exactly how the troublesome design software we grew up on made us feel,\u201d says its developer, who has created this pared-back vector editor with accessibility in mind. \nWhile it lacks many of the advanced features of Illustrator, then, it\u2019s got all the tools you need for basic vector editing - shapes, text, multiple layers and like - and what it does, it does very well.

It looks quite a bit like the Play:1 , but now comes equipped with a six-microphone array that the firm claims can pick up your voice anywhere in the room, no matter how loud the music is playing from its Class-D amplifiers. \nThe speaker marks an interesting evolution in not only Sonos\u2019s product line, but for Amazon\u2019s Alexa assistant on the whole, with the ability to control audio in any room from the Sonos One speaker. Sonos dubs this level of multi-room control \u2018continuity of control.\u2019 \nThat continuity extends beyond voice into touch controls as well as through the existing Sonos app, which will be updated with Alexa capability today, as of this writing. (Yes, this means that all Sonos speakers that aren\u2019t the One will support voice control, but through your phone.) Price and availability \nSonos is selling its One speaker for $199 or \u00a3199, which is largely on par with Amazon and Google\u2019s smart speakers. You can pre-order the Sonos One starting today, as of this writing, on Sonos\u2019s website \u2013 all orders ship starting October 24. \nIf you want truly stereo sound from the Sonos One, however, you\u2019ll have to buy an additional unit and place it in the same room. That said, Sonos One is compatible with every Sonos product to date in terms of joining a given sound system. \nSo, if you already have a few Sonos speakers or even a Sonos Playbar or Playbase in the house, then you can pick up a Sonos One and add Alexa voice control to that system. That is, of course, specifically through the one or two Sonos One speakers you have. \nFor existing Sonos customers, the Sonos One presents an impressive value through its compatibility and modularity. Design \nAgain, the Sonos One was built on the backbone of the Sonos Play:1 design \u2013 so much so that it\u2019s nearly the same speaker, save for a few key differences. Namely, this device includes a six-microphone array that wasn\u2019t there before, which allows for voice control via Amazon\u2019s Alexa digital assistant. \nTo give you peace of mind, the One includes a white microphone indicator LED that lets you know when Alexa is listening, and it\u2019s hard-wired to the microphone circuitry. \nAccording to Sonos, this hard-wired LED ensures that the speaker and Alexa cannot listen to your voice without the white light telling you as much. \nNow, the second major change: touch control. In replace of the buttons found on the Sonos Play:1, this new speaker employs capacitive touch controls that include a play and pause button as well as support for swiping gestures to skip back and forth between songs. \nThis change relegates the pairing button to the back of the device, just above the power and Ethernet ports. The Sonos One works over Wi-Fi, too, of course. \nThe Sonos One includes mounting hardware, so that it can be mounted to walls and ceilings or speaker stands. Sonos also ensured that the One is humidity-resistant, so that it can be hooked up in bathrooms during a shower or outside on the patio without damaging the hardware. \nJust like with most of its products, the Sonos One is available in both black and white colors. Performance \nIn practice, the Sonos One seems to generally work as expected: mostly spot-on with moments of annoying slip-ups that remind us how far voice recognition technology has left to go. During a demo we were provided, the One flubbed one song request, requiring the demo runner to repeat himself. \nBut, save for that one annoying mistake, the Sonos One performs admirably. If you have a Sonos Play:1 at home, then you can expect the same incredible depth, volume and nuance from the Sonos One \u2013 it uses the exact same audio hardware and software. Only now, we\u2019re told it\u2019s powered by a quad-core processor rather than a single-core in the Play:1. \nOf course, this serves the echo cancellation and voice recognition more than anything, and it shows. During the demo, a presenter requested a song change while music was playing at a normal volume, and the speaker responded in kind almost instantly without any need to shout. \nAs for the stereo audio feature with two Sonos One speakers, this too works admirably, making the audio even truer to the source recording of a given song. \nWhat\u2019s most interesting to us was that the Sonos One can control any Sonos speaker in the house regardless of whether said other speakers are indeed One models. This means that you can tell the Sonos system to play a song in the living room, where perhaps a Sonos Playbar is placed, from your Sonos One in the kitchen. \nAnd, of course, the Sonos One supports all the same functions as an Amazon Echo through Alexa, like telling the time or delivering you the latest news. Early verdict \nWe\u2019re genuinely impressed by the Sonos One overall. It\u2019s a massive improvement upon the existing Play:1 hardware, with its powerful six-microphone array and capacitive touch controls. \nVoice recognition was a bit dodgy during the demo that was presented to us, but we chalk that up more to user error and the general spottiness of digital assistant voice recognition on the whole than the Sonos One hardware. \nFor all of the Sonos One\u2019s improvements and compatibility with existing Sonos products, we\u2019d consider this a pretty excellent value, especially for those already in the Sonos camp. Plus, with Google Assistant and Apple AirPlay 2 coming to the platform in 2018, that value proposition will only get stronger. \nBut, of course, stay tuned for a full review \u2013 and remember that much of this functionality will be ready on your existing Sonos system via the Sonos app right about \u2026 now.

Shares \nAfter over a year of promises, Sonos has finally announced its own smart speaker. Called the Sonos One, the speaker will combine the intelligence of Amazon's Alexa with the multi-room capabilities of Sonos when it releases on October 24. \nNot to be outdone, Amazon has also announced some new additions to the Amazon Echo lineup. There are now a dizzying array of different Amazon Echo speakers from the screen-equipped Amazon Echo Show to the miniature Amazon Echo Dot, but for the purposes of this guide we'll be comparing the newly announced Amazon Echo, since this is likely to become the default version of the smart speaker going forward after it releases in November. \nHere's everything you need to know about how the two speakers compare. Price \nIn terms of price, the Sonos One is much more expensive than the updated Amazon Echo. The new Amazon Echo will cost $99 / \u00a389 when it goes on sale, while the Sonos One will cost $199 / \u00a3199. \nThat makes the Sonos One over double the price of the new Amazon Echo. \nDepending on what you plan on using your smart speaker for, however, the extra money could be worth it. Sound quality \nOne of the biggest selling points of the Sonos One is sound quality. With a pair of Class-D amplifiers and custom built drivers, the speaker looks set to deliver the same high level of audio quality that Sonos has become known for over the years. \nThe Sonos one also features the same Trueplay speaker tuning as Sonos's other speakers, \nAmazon's record on sound quality has historically been a little more patchy, with the original Amazon Echo being roundly criticised for lacking in bass. \nWith the new Amazon Echo, the company has promised that it's going to improve the situation. The new speaker features a dedicated tweeter and a 2.5-inch downward-firing woofer. In our hands-on review of the new Echo we thought that these improvements lead to a clearer and more immersive sound. \nOf course, if audio quality is your primary concern, then Amazon has also recently announced the Amazon Echo Plus , which features Dolby Processing for a better level of audio quality. Design \nIn terms of design, the Sonos One follows the same design philosophy as the company's existing Sonos Play:1 with a plastic finish that's available in either black or white. \nIn this regard Sonos seems to be following in Amazon's footsteps, as the finish will sound very familiar to anyone who's spent time with the original Echo. \nWith the new Echo however, Amazon has given its design an overhaul, introducing wood, cloth, and metallic finishes. \nAll this means the new Amazon Echo is the slightly more versatile looking of the two speakers overall. Multi-room functionality \nSonos was the brand that essentially invented the multi-room product category, and it's hence not surprising that the Sonos One will integrate with your existing Sonos speakers. \nYou can either pair it up with other speakers to play the same music, or else have different music playing in different rooms. You can even pair two Sonos Ones together for stereo sound, add a Sonos Sub to improve the bass, or pair them with a Sonos Playbar or Playbase to integrate them into a surround sound setup. \nThe Sonos One will also support Apple's AirPlay 2 with a forthcoming update, which will bolster its multi-room capabilities when used with iOS devices. \nAmazon has also added some multi-room functionality of its own with a recent update . \nIt's not quite as substantial as Sonos's offering, but it should allow you to play music seamlessly across your house from all of your Echo devices. Physical buttons \nAnother key difference between the two speakers is physical buttons. \nWhile the Amazon Echo gets by with just four buttons (two for volume, one to wake Alexa, and one to stop the device from listening to you), the Sonos One is much more fully featured. \nThe latter features touch controls that allow you to skip tracks without having to use your voice, which is helpful if you want to skip multiple tracks in quick succession (notoriously difficult when using voice controls). Other features \nWe initially suspected that Sonos's new speaker wouldn't otherwise have too much to distinguish it from Amazon's own hardware, but that was before the surprise announcement that the Sonos One will be made compatible with Google Assistant next year. \nThe update will mean you should have the ability to summon either voice assistant to control your smart speaker. \nIt's not yet clear how the two voice assistants will be combined. Presumably there'll be some option to switch between them in the Sonos app to avoid awkwardly summoning Google Assistant when you meant to ask for Alexa. \nNaturally, as an Amazon-made product, the Amazon Echo will stick to just supporting Alexa.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sonos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amazon echo show", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon echo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T19:19:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "908ec0446037ffb02c32f8bc4d1ace60469fe47d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3WVrkpvdrAoS4JstN27dm_0jnYgLh7UxVZwcbejSzaUexdM9R5UIE.QurRI4xEGmgCL_hDdO5DAaIiaG79iLOTq6DFJVgfdRyZUQ67QqUNyOE.lpQe87v0350NZ1mr57hmi3nApKeW0wOuUeVk3l0pg--", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://techradar.com//rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - All the latest technology news", "title": "The best free software for writers 2017", "title_full": "The best free software for writers 2017", "published": "2017-10-04T18:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/opoiGwDFJ6PkpMVF66AuL7-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1457, "comments": 0, "shares": 1457}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1222}, "linkedin": {"shares": 93}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 1}}}, "uuid": "908ec0446037ffb02c32f8bc4d1ace60469fe47d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3WVrkpvdrAoS4JstN27dm_0jnYgLh7UxVZwcbejSzaUexdM9R5UIE.QurRI4xEGmgCL_hDdO5DAaIiaG79iLOTq6DFJVgfdRyZUQ67QqUNyOE.lpQe87v0350NZ1mr57hmi3nApKeW0wOuUeVk3l0pg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gary Marshall", "published": "2017-10-04T18:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "The best free software for writers 2017", "text": "The best free software for writers 2017 The best free software for writers 2017 Plan, write and prepare to publish Shares \nWriters tend to make a very big deal of their tools, whether those tools are delicate pens or ancient typewriters.

Google Home Mini features \nWith an enclosure made entirely out of fabric, the speaker has an incredebly rounded design. \nThere are four lights underneath the fabric that indicate when the speaker is listening to you, and its top can be tapped instead of saying 'OK Google' out loud. \nGoogle advertises that the speaker offers 360 degree sound and has far-field microphones that can hear you through the sound of music playing. \nIn terms of the functionality of the speaker, we\u2019re expecting it to offer much of the same functionality as the full-size Google Home, albeit with a much smaller (and therefore likely weaker) speaker. \nPrior to its announcement, a leaked Walmart listing suggested the speaker will measure in at 4.53 x 4.53 x 4.72 inches (11.5cm x 11.5cm x 12cm), which is just a shade bigger than the Amazon Echo Dot\u2019s 3.3 inch diameter and 1.3 inch height. \nThe speaker will be available in three colors , Chalk (a slightly off white), Charcoal (a dark gray) or Coral (light pink). \nThe cord present in the images suggest that the speaker will, like its bigger brother, rely on mains rather than battery power. \nAlso prior to its announcement screenshots from someone living near the Google campus suggest that the speaker will unsurprisingly be set up in much the same way as the existing Google Home speaker through the Google Home app. @ArtemR Google Home Mini confirmed. #lol cc @jasonhowell @ronxo @Ohthatflo pic.twitter.com/GpmgDk0T5T October 2, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google pixel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amazon echo show", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google home mini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon echo dot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T19:28:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8049bebfe70e8e1b22201f3b90418ee0092fcfbb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3NGpJBzISZS.y5J.lf6o92HZx1_5NadTJv3PtevbmoeVw6iT4WhogLvpvPsPfszLm", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Amazon might soon have its own town | TechRadar", "title_full": "Amazon might soon have its own town | TechRadar", "published": "2017-10-04T12:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.135, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBZrpn98LDvFwC8x9HYSk-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 31, "comments": 0, "shares": 31}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2987}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8049bebfe70e8e1b22201f3b90418ee0092fcfbb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3NGpJBzISZS.y5J.lf6o92HZx1_5NadTJv3PtevbmoeVw6iT4WhogLvpvPsPfszLm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gerald Lynch", "published": "2017-10-04T12:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Amazon might soon have its own town | TechRadar", "text": "Amazon might soon have its own town Amazon might soon have its own town A new HQ could be named after the Kindle kings.

Instead of asking Google Assistant to turn up the music so it can be heard over the sound of the machine, the AI inside the Home Max will dynamically adjust the sound to make it more audible. \nThe Google Home Max will launch in December of this year for $399 (about \u00a3300, AU$500) \u2013 first in the US and then come to other countries around the world \u2013 and will come with a free 12-month subscription to YouTube Red.

We've put together a guide so you can see every shade in one place. \nIf you're planning on picking up the newly launched Google Pixel 2 or Google Pixel 2 XL , you'll have a few different color choices for the new devices. \nBelow we've listed all of the colors we've seen for both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, but we don't currently know if certain markets will have limited color choices at launch. \nThe colors are different for both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL too, so make sure you're clear on what version of the phone you want to buy. Just Black The Google Pixel 2 in Just Black Image 2 of 2 The Google Pixel 2 XL also comes in Just Black too \nYeah, the name of this one kind of sums it up. The darkest version of the Pixel 2 comes with two slightly different shades of black, but it's not as bold as the other options for both of the phones. This is by far the darkest shade, and you'll be able to buy both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL in this color. Kinda Blue This is the Google Pixel 2 in Kinda Blue \nThis is the only version of the Pixel 2 that comes in a different shade to either black or white. Kinda Blue is a little muted compared to most other blue phones on the market right now, but it still looks like an attractive handset and you'll only be able to get this shade on the Pixel 2, and not the Pixel 2 XL. Clearly White Only the Google Pixel 2 comes in Clearly White, so bad luck if you wanted the Pixel 2 XL \nIf you're looking for the lightest shade of the Pixel 2, this is it. The clearly sarcastic name refers to how plain the phone looks, but if you're looking for an indistinct color this could be a great choice. Clearly White is only available on the Pixel 2 and won't be a color choice for the Pixel 2 XL. Black & White The Black & White version is just for the Google Pixel 2 XL \nThis is perhaps the most contrasting look for the phone and is exclusive to the XL version of the Pixel 2. The top part is a deep black, much like the top half of the Just Black version, while the bottom is a clean white shade. It looks to be one of the boldest color choices on the market for any phone right now, but it's an attractive look.

Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone X design \nBoth the iPhone X and the Google Pixel 2 have glass on their backs, but while the rear of the iPhone X is all glass, on the Pixel 2 there\u2019s just a strip of glass at the top, while the rest of the back is metal. That gives it a two-tone effect, while the iPhone X is all one color on the rear. \nThe sides of both phones are metal, but their fronts are very different, as while the iPhone X is almost all screen, with just a small notch at the top, the Pixel 2 has quite large bezels above and below the screen. \nOther differences include their dimensions, with the Pixel 2 coming in at 145.7 x 69.7 x 7.8mm, while the iPhone X is 143.6 x 70.9 x 7.7mm, and their color schemes, as the Pixel 2 is landing in black, white and blue, while the iPhone X will be available in space grey and silver. \nThere are other similarities too though. Neither phone has a 3.5mm headphone port for example, and they\u2019re both IP67 certified dust and water resistant, meaning they can be submerged up to 1 meter deep for up to 30 minutes. Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone X display \nThis is one of the biggest differences between the Google Pixel 2 and the iPhone X, as while the Pixel 2 has a 5.0-inch 1,080 x 1,920 AMOLED display, the iPhone X has a 5.8-inch 1,125 x 2,436 AMOLED screen. So the display technology is similar, but the screen on the iPhone X is a lot bigger and far higher resolution. \nYou also get True Tone with the iPhone X, which is a feature that automatically adjusts the white balance of the display based on the surrounding light, but the Pixel 2 has an always-on display, meaning it can stay partially lit up at all times, showing notifications and the time. \nCleverly the always-on screen can even identify songs that are playing around you without you having to ask. Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone X OS and power \nThe Pixel 2 runs Android Oreo, while the iPhone X, of course, runs iOS 11. iOS is much the same on all Apple handsets \u2013 though slightly tweaked on the iPhone X, to add gesture controls in place of a home button. Android meanwhile can vary quite a lot between handsets, but with the Pixel 2 you get a stock version, so it\u2019s as Google intended. \nThough there is one notable addition in the form of \u2018Active Edge\u2019, which is what Google\u2019s calling the Pixel 2\u2019s squeezable sides. It\u2019s a lot like the feature we\u2019ve seen on the HTC U11 , and allows you to launch Google Assistant by simply squeezing your phone. \nThe closest the iPhone X comes to that is 3D Touch, which lets the phone respond differently depending on how hard you press on the screen. \nIn practice both operating systems are polished and clutter-free, at least until you fill your phone with apps. Both handsets should also get updated to new versions of their respective operating systems as soon as they\u2019re available. \nOn the power front the differences should be less noticeable. The Google Pixel 2 has an octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset and 4GB of RAM, making it a match for many 2017 Android flagships, including the US version of the Samsung Galaxy S8 , while the iPhone X has a hexa-core A11 Bionic chipset and likely 3GB of RAM \u2013 though Apple itself hasn\u2019t confirmed the RAM amount. \nAs usual, the Android phone sounds faster on paper, but in benchmarks the iPhone X has stormed ahead of Android flagships, and in real world use both of these phones are likely to feel very fast. Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone X biometric security \nBiometric security is worth highlighting, as it\u2019s one of the main features of the iPhone X. Specifically, the phone has a facial recognition system dubbed Face ID, allowing you to unlock your phone just by looking at it. We\u2019ll give you all the details on how well it works in our full review, but there\u2019s a lot of tech involved, and Apple claims it\u2019s both reliable and secure. \nWhat the iPhone X doesn\u2019t have is the more conventional fingerprint scanner option. The Pixel 2 does though, with a scanner on the back of the phone. Again, we\u2019ll let you know how well this works in our full review, but the choice could well come down to whether you\u2019d rather have something futuristic or familiar. Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone X camera and battery \nWhile the Google Pixel 2 has a 12MP f/1.8 single-lens camera, the iPhone X has a 12MP dual-lens one, with f/1.8 and f/2.4 lenses. Both phones sport optical image stabilization, but the extra lens on the iPhone X grants it some extra tricks, including optical zoom and the ability to focus on the foreground while blurring the background to create a bokeh effect. \nAround the front the Pixel 2 has an 8MP camera, while the iPhone X has a 7MP one, but thanks to its face scanner the iPhone X again has some additional tricks, such as being able to bring emoji to life and have them imitate your facial expressions and speech. \nFor battery, you get a 2,700mAh one in the Google Pixel 2 supposedly offering 'all day life' and reportedly a 2,716mAh one in the iPhone X, though Apple hasn\u2019t confirmed this. \nAssuming that\u2019s accurate the two phones have almost identically sized batteries, but the iPhone X has a much larger screen to power, so may well not last as long. We\u2019ll let you know how they stack up when we\u2019ve put both phones through full reviews. Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone X price \nThe Pixel 2 costs $649 / \u00a3629 / AU$$1,079, making it an expensive phone, but a lot cheaper than the iPhone X, which starts at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,579. Of course, Apple\u2019s phone is larger and arguably more high-end. Keep an eye out for our full reviews to see whether we think each phone is worth what it costs. Takeaway \nWhile the Pixel 2 will likely be one of the iPhone X\u2019s main competitors, these two phones are actually quite different. \nObviously they run different operating systems, but beyond that the iPhone X is a larger and arguably more forward-thinking phone, with a price tag to match. \nThey\u2019re both high-end though, with premium designs and lots of power, so assuming they live up to their potential it\u2019s unlikely that either of these phones will let you down. As always though we\u2019d recommend waiting until we\u2019ve given our final verdicts before picking up either of them.

Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone 8 design \nThe Pixel 2 has a mostly metal back with a glass strip taking up the top quarter, a lot like the original Google Pixel , and like that phone it also has sizeable bezels around the screen. \nThe iPhone 8 also has large bezels, though while that uses the lower one to house a home button and fingerprint scanner, the Pixel 2 has its scanner on the back. \nAnd from the back these are quite different looking phones, as the back of the iPhone 8 is all glass (though it has a metal frame) and it doesn\u2019t have the two-tone color you\u2019ll find on the Pixel 2. \nThe iPhone 8 is also marginally smaller than the Pixel 2, as the Pixel 2 comes in at 145.7 x 69.7 x 7.8mm, whereas the iPhone 8 is 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3mm. However, these are both reasonably compact handsets. \nThe Pixel 2 also lacks a headphone port, just like the iPhone 8, and it\u2019s IP67 certified dust and water resistant, meaning it can be submerged up to 1 meter deep for up to 30 minutes. That\u2019s a match for the iPhone 8 as well. \nOne thing that doesn\u2019t match though is their color schemes. The iPhone 8 is available in silver, space gray and gold, while the Pixel 2 comes in black, white and blue. Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone 8 display \nThe Pixel 2\u2019s screen is small, especially by flagship standards, at 5 inches. It\u2019s also not as high resolution as some recent flagships \u2013 including the Pixel 2 XL \u2013 coming in at 1,080 x 1,920. Though like the iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy S8 it has an OLED display. \nThe iPhone 8 on the other hand is LCD, which means the Pixel 2 is likely to be capable of displaying blacker blacks and offering better contrast. It\u2019s also bigger and sharper than the 4.7-inch 750 x 1,334 iPhone 8 display. \nThough Apple\u2019s screen does have some tricks up its sleeve, such as True Tone, which automatically adjusts the white balance to suit the ambient light. \nThat\u2019s not to say the Pixel 2 doesn\u2019t have fancy features as well though. One such feature is an always-on display, allowing you to see the time and notifications without waking the phone up. \nThe always-on display can even automatically identify whatever song is playing without you having to ask. Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone 8 OS and power \nThis is one of the biggest and most obvious differences between these two phones \u2013 the Pixel 2 runs Android Oreo, while the iPhone 8 runs iOS 11. \nIf you\u2019ve ever used Androids and iPhones before you\u2019ll know broadly what to expect here, but these are the latest versions of each operating system and both phones should get day one software updates. That\u2019s standard on iOS, but not on Android, so worth mentioning. \nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that the Pixel 2 sports a new feature in the form of \u2018Active Edge\u2019. This lets you squeeze the sides to launch Google Assistant. The iPhone 8 doesn\u2019t have such a feature, but it does have 3D Touch, which allows the screen to respond differently depending on how hard you tap it. \nAs for power, the Google Pixel 2 has an octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset and 4GB of RAM. That\u2019s a fairly standard flagship spec in Android land, matched by the likes of the HTC U11 and Sony Xperia XZ1 . \nIt\u2019s plenty powerful in other words, as is the iPhone 8, which sports a hexa-core A11 Bionic chipset and 2GB of RAM. The latter may sound disappointing, but in practice not much seems to be able to slow this phone down. Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone 8 camera and battery \nThese two phones have similar camera setups, with both sporting a 12MP rear f/1.8 camera (complete with optical image stabilization) while the Pixel 2 has an 8MP front-facing one and the iPhone 8 has a 7MP front-facing one. \nWe\u2019ll let you know how good the Google Pixel 2\u2019s camera is in practice once we\u2019ve put it through a full review, but DxOMark has given it the highest score of any phone, while in our own tests the iPhone 8 has a good but not quite class-leading camera. \nAs for battery, the Pixel 2 has a 2,700mAh one, which is actually an ever so slight downgrade on the original Google Pixel\u2019s, but still a lot bigger than the 1,821mAh one in the iPhone 8. Hopefully it also translates into longer life, as the iPhone 8 just barely lasts a day. \nGoogle claims its phone offers 'all day life', but we'll let you know how true that is when we've reviewed it. Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone 8 price \nThe Google Pixel 2 costs $649 / \u00a3629 / AU$$1,079, making it a similar price to the iPhone 8, which starts at $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,079 for a 64GB version, rising to $849 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,329 for a 256GB one. They\u2019re expensive phones then, but both undercut many flagships, including the Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. Takeaway \nIf you want a compact flagship you don\u2019t have many options, and these could well be two of the best. But while they\u2019re both small and powerful they have a lot of differences. \nOf the two the Pixel 2 is larger, and it has quite a different look, thanks to the two-tone metal and glass back. It also has a sharper screen and a bigger battery, though its fingerprint scanner is arguably less convenient, since it\u2019s on the back rather than the front. \nBut the two phones look to have similar cameras, along with the same level of waterproofing and a similar price. \nThe biggest difference is likely to be their operating systems, and you probably already know which of those you prefer. But for anyone who\u2019s platform agnostic it could be a tough choice between the two. Keep an eye out for our full review of the Google Pixel 2, to hopefully make the decision easier. Will the Pixel 2 make our best phones list ?

Read our hands-on Google Pixel 2 review \nIt's also more powerful, with an improved camera and new features. Not everything has necessarily changed for the better though, as for example the 3.5mm headphone port has been ditched. \nThere's a lot to take on board, but we've covered everything you need to know. Read on for full details of every aspect of the Pixel 2. What is it? Google's new flagship smartphone How much will it cost? Starts at $649 / \u00a3629 (AU$840) When will it release? Pre-orders are now open, hits stores October 19 Google Pixel 2 price and release date Starts at $649 / \u00a3629 for 64GB model Pre-orders are open, arrives in stores on October 19 \nGoogle's October 4 launch event segued into an immediate pre-order phase for the Google Pixel 2 phone in countries like the US, UK, Australia and Canada. \nWhile you can get the phone unlocked in the US through Google, there are pre-orders through Verizon, too. \nThe actual Google Pixel 2 release date is on Thursday, October 19. That's when the first shipments of the new phone will begin. \nThe Google Pixel 2 price starts at $649 or \u00a3629 for 64GB version. It'll cost more for the 128GB option, at $749 and \u00a3729. \nFor a limited time only, you'll also get a free Google Home Mini with your purchase of the new Pixel 2 if you're in the US, UK, Australia, Canada or Germany. Google Pixel 2 display 5-inch, full HD AMOLED display Always-on display shows a variety of information \nThe Google Pixel 2 has a 5-inch, 1080p AMOLED display, which comes in at 441 pixels per inch. That's pretty standard, but the new feature here is the always-on display. \nThe always-on display can show you the time, date, email and text message notifications and reminders on screen without you having to touch or wake the Pixel 2. \nIf you're playing music, the Pixel 2 can also detect the song and display the tune that's playing on the always-on display as well. This doesn't even need an internet connection to recognize the tune, as it uses an on-device database of music. Google Pixel 2 design Fastest fingerprint scanner of any phone Dual front-facing speakers \nThe Google Pixel 2 has a metal body with a chunk of glass at the top of the rear of the phone, where the camera and flash is located. \nThe power/lock and volume keys are on the right of the handset, while there's a USB-C port on the base. The biggest design change on the Pixel 2 however is the removal of the headphone jack. \nThat means you'll either have to use a set of Bluetooth headphones, USB-C connected headphones or a clunky adapter if you want to use a traditional pair. \nRound the back the new Pixel 2 has a centralized fingerprint scanner, which Google claims is the fastest one on any phone. \nIt's also IP67 dust and water resistant, which means it will survive a dip in the bath and a trip to the beach without struggling with the conditions. \nOn the front there's a slightly slimmer bezel on either side of the screen vs the original Google Pixel, but there's still a very obvious chunk above and below the display, as it opts for a more iPhone 8 / Sony Xperia XZ1 layout rather than the all-screen Galaxy S8 and LG G6 . \nThis does mean, however, you get front facing speakers, which should provide a better audio experience. We don't see this feature on enough phones. \nThe Google Pixel 2 will be available in three colors, Just Black, Clearly White and Kinda Blue. Google Pixel 2 power Snapdragon 835 chipset and 4GB of RAM \nThe Google Pixel 2 comes with the latest Snapdragon 835 chipset under the hood, giving it plenty of power and matching the setup in the LG V30 , HTC U11 and Sony Xperia XZ1. \nThat's paired with 4GB of RAM, which combined means you'll be able to throw pretty much anything at the Pixel 2 and it should run it without issue. \nWe will, of course, be putting that to the test in our in-depth Google Pixel 2 review in the coming weeks. \nYou also get the choice of either 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, although the price between them is rather vast. Google Pixel 2 camera 12MP rear camera with 98 DxOMark (highest for any phone) OIS and EIS for video recording \nThe Google Pixel 2 camera has a 98 DxO score (with the original Pixel getting 89), which is the highest score of any smartphone camera. It has a 12MP rear camera with OIS (optical image stabilization), combined with HDR smarts. \nYep - that's right... it's only a single lens on the rear of the phone. \nIt still comes with Portrait mode, allowing you to take professional looking shots by blurring the background to make the foreground pop. \nWhile most rivals achieve this with a dual camera setup, the Pixel 2 uses just one camera with a dual pixel setup. \nPortrait mode doesn't just work on the rear camera, with the front facing camera also offering the feature. \nFor video recording, the Pixel 2 uses both OIS and EIS, giving you smoother, clearer footage. If you're more into selfies, you'll get an 8MP front-facing camera. \nIf you buy the Pixel 2 you'll also get unlimited photo and video cloud storage at full resolution until 2021. After that date any new uploads will be limited to 16MP photos and 1080p videos, but your existing files won't be compressed. Google Pixel 2 battery All day battery life 7 hours use from a 15 minute charge \nGoogle claims that the Pixel 2 will give you an all-day battery life and fast charging that can give you up to seven hours of use from just 15 minutes of top up time. \nThe actual size of the battery is 2,700mAh, and we'll be putting it to the test during our in-depth review process to see if it can really last a day. \nDisappointingly there's no wireless charging support, so you're out of luck if you were hoping for this feature on the Pixel 2. Google Pixel 2 operating system Runs stock Android 8.0 Oreo out the box \nNo surprise here, as the Google Pixel 2 runs the stock version of Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. \nIt's the latest version of Google's operating system and the Pixel 2 (and Pixel 2 XL) will be used to highlight the benefits of a pure Android experience. \nYou'll also benefit from Google Assistant, providing a wide range of voice-enabled functions and features. \nAs the Pixel 2 has been built by HTC for Google, it also features the squeeze sensor we saw in the HTC U11. You can use this to launch Google Assistant at any point, with a smart squeeze detection meaning you shouldn't accidentally activate Assistant when you're just holding the handset.

Cut to the chase What is it? Google's next plus-sized smartphone How much will it cost? $849 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 When will it release? Pre-orders open now, with a November 15 launch Google Pixel 2 XL price and release date Starts at $849 / \u00a3799 /AU$1079 Pre-orders open now Hits stores on November 15 \nThe Google Pixel 2 XL release date and price has been revealed at the company\u2019s big autumn event, and if you were hoping to pick it up today, you\u2019ll be a bit disappointed that it will ship on November 15. \nBut you shouldn\u2019t wait too long to start saving: Google\u2019s phablet is available for pre-order and the 64GB option will set you back $849 / \u00a3799 /AU$1079, a jump in price of $80 over the original Pixel XL. \nIf you want the larger-storage model, which comes in at 128GB, it's going to cost a rather large \u00a3899 / $949, and we're waiting for other regional prices to appear. \nLooking back at last year\u2019s pricing structure, which saw the 2016 Pixel XL go for $769 (\u00a3719, AU$1,269), the new phone is now a $200 jump above the base cost of the Google Pixel 2, instead of last year\u2019s $100 price difference between the two sizes. \nWant that extra battery and souped-up screen resolution? It\u2019s going to cost you. \nAnd that\u2019s just for the 64GB model, which to be fair, is double the capacity of last year\u2019s 32GB base model Pixel XL \u2013 a good move. But if you want 128GB, the price will go up another $100, bringing you ever so close to the cost of an iPhone X . \nGoogle has surprisingly staggered the release of the smaller and larger phones. The Pixel 2 will release on October 19, but you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer for the larger phone to arrive. Google Pixel 2 XL screen 6-inch QHD display Tiny bezels \nAs was the case when comparing the original Pixel devices, the screen resolution of the Pixel 2 XL sticks out as one of the biggest advantages to going grande. \nBoth will feature a vibrant P-OLED display, though only the larger 6-inch model will feature a 2,880 x 1,440 resolution, a spec that lends brilliantly to virtual reality games applications enjoyed via the Google Daydream View headset. \nBut these aren\u2019t the only differences between them. \nThe Pixel 2 XL has joined the bezel-light party alongside the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 , LG V30 and LG G6 , though it\u2019s not nearly as borderless (read: impressive) as the iPhone X or Essential Phone . \nStill, it\u2019s the same idea here that\u2019s put into effect: a tall 18:9 aspect ratio that makes the screen twice as tall as it is wide. The result is a large-screened phone that\u2019s still easy to operate single-handed. Google Pixel 2 XL design A two-tone metal and glass build Dust and water resistant \nStaying on the front of the device for a bit longer, its duo of front-firing speakers come into view. \nAt our first look of the Pixel 2 XL, it definitely seemed louder and more direct than your average phone speaker performance, though the demo was shown in a loud, crowded room. \nYou\u2019ll likely want to keep a set of wireless headphones handy. \nNow on our way to the back of the IP67-protected phone, the divisive split of glass and aluminum is still here (and you\u2019ll still either love or hate it), though the melding of materials is more confidently executed this year. \nOtherwise, the button layout looks similar to last year\u2019s model, with a grooved power button and a volume rocker taking their place on the right side. \nFor those interested in picking up with the Pixel 2 XL in a wacky color (raises hands), the batch of colors available might disappoint \u2013 there are only two. \nIt will be available in \u201cJust Black\u201d, a melding of black aluminum with charcoal-colored glass, or \u201cBlack & White\u201d. \nWhile the latter is exactly how it sounds (the top being black, bottom being white) this color\u2019s power button is a bold orange. \nSome have described this as the \u201cpanda\u201d look, but we're settling on penguin given the orange power button. Finally, both options will have black bezels around the front. \nUnfortunately, the Google Pixel 2 seems to be the only model that\u2019s getting a cool color option. Have you seen \u201cKinda Blue\u201d? It\u2019s colorful in a subtle yet brilliant way. \nComing back to that comment made about wireless headphones, cutting the cord is almost mandatory here because this phone (along with the smaller Pixel 2) has removed the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 the first Google-made phones to ditch the legacy port. \nAs it turns out, Google has announced the Pixel Buds , the company's first set of wireless headphones, to fill that gap. Google Pixel 2 XL camera and battery A 12MP single-lens rear camera An 8MP front-facing snapper \nThe camera performance is one of the original Pixel\u2019s strongest suits and in our limited time using the Pixel 2 XL, Google looks to build upon that success in the Pixel 2 XL. \nThe rear-facing camera, which is nearly the same size as the fingerprint reader, contains a 12MP sensor with an f/1.8 aperture. We\u2019re hopeful to see some improvements here and this is something we\u2019ll be testing in-depth in our full review. \nIt's not a dual-lens camera though, unlike much of the competition this year. That said, it does still employ dual pixel technology to allow for a depth effect which Google claims is just as good thanks to machine learning. \nThe original Pixel XL featured a 3,450mAh battery and Google has boosted it slightly to 3,520mAh for the Pixel 2 XL. Google Pixel 2 XL specs and OS Speedy Snapdragon 835 chipset and 4GB of RAM Stock Android Oreo Active Edge lets you squeeze to launch Google Assistant \nThe Google Pixel 2 XL features the Snapdragon 835, a celebrated chipset that is rather fast and efficient even as we move closer towards 2018. \nPaired alongside this powerful, ubiquitous system-on-a-chip is 4GB of RAM \u2013 the same RAM count as last year\u2019s model. \nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and OnePlus 5 have powered ahead with 6GB of RAM, though the gains won\u2019t be noticeable to most using today\u2019s applications. \nHeck, the iPhone X will ship with 3GB of RAM, so until apps become even more demanding (which might happen pretty quickly thanks to the introduction of ARCore) 4GB will continue being a viable offering for real-world use. \nMoving onto software, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will be the true showcases for Android Oreo, even though several other phones already have the software. \nSure, you can experience just about everything else that Google\u2019s latest operating system update has to offer on the Google Pixel, Google Nexus 6P and Sony Xperia XZ1 , and soon many Moto phones, but the latest Pixel has some special treats in store. \nOne of which includes the HTC U11 \u2019s most interesting feature: its squeeze-friendly sides . Google has rebranded it to be called \u201cActive Edge\u201d and it will give users a new way of interacting with Android Oreo, which could be a super handy feature given this particular phone\u2019s larger size in the hand. \nWhile stock Android offers a few shortcuts, like double tapping the power button to launch the camera, Active Edge adds one more, letting you squeeze the phone to launch Google Assistant. \nWe\u2019ve spent plenty of time with this feature in our combined experience with the U11 and Pixel 2 XL and whether it will become a de-facto method for getting to Google remains to be seen. \nBeing able to squeeze to call up Google Assistant without the need for a dedicated hardware button (ahem, Bixby) is certainly neat, but your real-world mileage may vary. \nWe\u2019ve recently spent time with the Pixel XL 2 and if you want some more information, including hands-on photos and impressions, check out our full hands on Google Pixel 2 XL review . \nAnd, of course, stay tuned for the full review, which we\u2019re excited to bring you a bit closer to its November launch.

For many phones updated to Android 8.0, another name for Oreo, boot speeds will be increased as much as two times, as we've personally seen with the Google Pixel. Additionally, the operating system update tackles pesky background activity that drains your battery and your data plan. \nWhile it's light on visual changes, Oreo packs in some useful design tweaks, like picture-in-picture (PiP) mode for the likes of YouTube, Hangouts and others, as well as notification dots that give you a colorful nudge to check out your notifications. \nHead below to read more about the best features coming with the Android Oreo update. But first, check out which phones are compatible with the software. \nNot seeing your phone, or the one of your wishlist? Don't fret just yet, as more phones have been confirmed to support the update later this year from the likes of Essential, Huawei, Samsung, Motorola, LG, HMD Global, Sony and more. \nThe list of supported devices will undoubtedly grow as the year goes on. Even the newly announced Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL come with the latest software straight out of the box. Here\u2019s how to install Android Oreo right now When can I download Android Oreo? \nIf you don't own a Google Pixel , Google Pixel XL , Nexus 6P or Nexus 5X , the wait for Android Oreo is set to continue. For some phone manufacturers, that could mean a matter of months, while others are much closer. \nCompanies are typically quiet on this topic until there's good news to deliver, but rest assured that we'll be updating this page with the latest. \nGoogle itself has confirmed that the Oreo update will hit devices from many popular manufacturers by the end of the year. And while it doesn't call the particular phones out by name, Google's official statement is as follows: \n\"Hardware makers including Essential, General Mobile, HMD Global Home of Nokia Phones, Huawei, HTC, Kyocera, LG, Motorola, Samsung, Sharp and Sony are scheduled to launch or upgrade devices to Android 8.0 Oreo \" \nWith that information, we can safely guess that this includes (at the very least) the Essential Phone , the Samsung Galaxy S8 , Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus , Samsung Galaxy Note 8 , LG G6 , LG V30 , Sony Xperia XZ Premium and more. Don't see your phone on this list? No need to fret just yet. \nHere are the phones confirmed to get the update. Nokia \nWe've received official confirmation that Nokia 6 , Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 will receive Oreo and soon after we also heard word the Nokia 8 will get the update too. \nAn actual release date for the Nokia 8 to get Android Oreo is unclear, but the beta of the software is currently 1.3GB big according to a tweet from Juho Sarvikas, Chief Product Officer at HMD Global. HTC \nHTC has confirmed the HTC U11 , HTC 10 and HTC U Ultra will all feature Android Oreo at some stage, but exact timings for the update are currently unclear. OnePlus \nThe OnePlus 5 is an obvious candidate, but OnePlus has also confirmed that the OnePlus 3T and OnePlus 3 will receive the update. Sony \nThe new Sony Xperia XZ1 and Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact will both run Android Oreo out of the box when they arrive this autumn. \nAdditionally, the company is also updating the Sony Xperia X , Sony Xperia X Performance , Sony Xperia XZ , Sony Xperia X Compact , Sony Xperia XZ Premium , Sony Xperia XZs , Sony Xperia XA1 , Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra and Sony Xperia XA1 Plus . Motorola \nHave a Moto phone? The company recently stated that it will start rolling out the update this autumn to the following phones: Moto Z , Moto Z Force , Moto Z2 Force , Moto Z Play , Moto Z2 Play , Moto G5 , Moto G5S, Moto G5 Plus , Moto G5S Plus , Moto X4 and Moto G4 Plus . \nPreviously, the company had promised to update the Moto G4 Plus to Android O software, but made no mention of that handset - or the Moto G4 - in its announcement. While Moto has done right by changing its tune and adding support for the plus-sized budget G4, it appears that the regular G4, as well as the Moto G4 Play , will sit this one out. \nWe'll be updating this article with the latest Android Oreo release date news as it happens, so be sure to check back and see if your phone is included. Samsung \nNothing is confirmed for Samsung products yet, but a blog run by Samsung Turkey suggests any products from the company that will be updated will have to wait until early 2018 to see the upgrade land. \nWe expect to see the Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8 Plus and Galaxy Note 8 see the update and maybe even the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge too.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "juho sarvikas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oneplus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hmd global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general mobile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "htc  htc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google pixel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moto z force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyocera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony xperia x compact", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "htc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony xperia xz premium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung galaxy s8", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nokia phones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motorola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nokia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "htc u ultra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T21:41:55.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f46f2bf5e1d1ac520a5cf6be3b86b6a2afa8f8fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3RuwlObRIjxTFEWNWzgve6R1UZp18BuoI8X.XaHcPBLrlqsp8.MmZ_y5ts51vBgPzFgAseSUJ6o4.2HFRraANj7xRJPtrYB3waLQwiYwICws-", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/au/rss", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - All the latest technology news", "title": "Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL: which new phone should you buy?", "title_full": "Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL: which new phone should you buy?", "published": "2017-10-04T21:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sttmpyi73b9g6xksvwKcuW-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 116, "comments": 0, "shares": 116}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f46f2bf5e1d1ac520a5cf6be3b86b6a2afa8f8fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3RuwlObRIjxTFEWNWzgve6R1UZp18BuoI8X.XaHcPBLrlqsp8.MmZ_y5ts51vBgPzFgAseSUJ6o4.2HFRraANj7xRJPtrYB3waLQwiYwICws-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James Peckham", "published": "2017-10-04T21:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL: which new phone should you buy?", "text": "Is it just size that's different? Shares \nGoogle has just announced its two new handsets for 2017 at an event in San Francisco and we now know everything we need to about both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL . \nThese are follow up handsets to the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL , but there are more key differences between the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL than there were between the handsets released last year. Check out our early look at the Pixel 2 XL with our video run through \nThe exact release date for the phones is set as October 19 for the Pixel 2, but you'll have to wait until around November 15 to buy the larger phone. \nBelow we are going to compare the new phones so you can decide whether it's worth waiting for the Pixel 2 XL or you want to grab the Pixel 2 when it first comes out. Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL design \nIf you know the original Pixel and Pixel XL well, you won't be particularly surprised by the design of the two new phones. \nThe Pixel 2 is smaller than the Pixel 2 XL, but the two-toned design of the rear on the two phones looks rather similar. Each comes with an aluminium design and curved edges on the back. \nColors differ a little with both phones launching in \"Just Black\", \"Black and White\" but the smaller phone looks to be the only phone coming in \"Kinda Blue\", which you can see below on the right. \nThe power button is a different color on some too, with the Black and White variant having a bright orange button and Kinda Blue getting a jazzy blue button too. Google Pixel 2 colors: what shades can you buy? \nThe bad news is both phones will not have 3.5mm headphone jacks which we think is to specifically allow for it to be waterproof, unlike the original Pixel. \nEach handset has a USB-C port on the bottom and the power/volume keys are on the right hand side of the handset. The fingerprint sensor sits on the rear of each phone too. Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL display \nScreen is going to be one of the big differing factor for both versions of the Pixel 2. The smaller Pixel 2 will come with a 5-inch screen with a Full HD resolution. \nIt's OLED tech and come with a traditional 16:9 ratio, unlike a lot of phones we've seen this year. All of that seems quite predictable, but both new phones also include an always-on display too. \nThe Pixel 2 XL has a 6-inch display with a ratio of 18:9 with a resolution of 2560 x 1312. It uses AMOLED tech and comes with a thinner bezel, but it still doesn't look as bezeless as the Samsung Galaxy S8 or iPhone X . \nIf you're after the latest and greatest beautiful screen tech, you'll want to opt for the Pixel 2 XL over the smaller Pixel 2. Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL OS and power \nThe new Google Pixel phones are running the latest Android Oreo software and it'll be ready to roll as soon as you take it out of the box. It'll be in a stock capacity and work in a very similar way to how we've seen it on the older Pixel devices. \nWhen it comes to power, both phones are running the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset that performs particularly well on a series of flagship phones we've already seen launch this year. \nBoth phones have 4GB of RAM and storage wise we know your choice is either 64GB or 128GB of internal memory. Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL camera and battery \nCamera wise, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will both feature the same shooter setup. Each has a 13MP camera on the rear, but it won't be a dual sensor shooter like a lot of modern smartphones. \nInstead the single sensor is very large - as large as the fingerprint sensor itself - that should allow for lots of light and hopefully should mean great photography in poor lighting \nThere's optical image stabilization on the rear camera that works with electronic image stabilization to offer smoother video than on other handsets. On the front there's also a 7MP camera for selfies. To learn more about the camera tech, head to our Google Pixel 2 explainer \nBattery will be a big differing factor between the two phones too. Google hasn't officially unveiled the battery capacities, but previous leaks have given us a good idea at how big each cell will be. \nOne source claimed the Pixel 2 would come with a 2,700mAh battery while another leak suggests the Pixel 2 XL will have a 3,520mAh cell. \nThat heavily suggests the battery will be much better on the Pixel 2 XL, but we won't know for certain until we get the phones to review in the coming weeks. Whether wireless charging or fast-charging tech will be available is currently unclear too. Google Pixel 2 vs Google Pixel 2 XL price \nNeither of these phones are going to be cheap. The original Pixel was $649 (\u00a3599, AU$1,079) at launch, and we know for certain the Pixel 2 will also cost $649, but the price has jumped up to \u00a3629 in the UK. \nWe don't know the Australian price yet, but it'll likely be around AU$1,079. \nThe Pixel XL was $769 (\u00a3719, AU$1,269) but the price of the Pixel 2 XL has jumped up significantly to $849/\u00a3799 (around AU$1,079). If you're after a more affordable Pixel 2, you'll want the smaller one but neither of these handsets are particularly affordable. Takeaway \nThe Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are quite similar handsets. You'll get most of the same features, it's just whether you'd like a larger - and higher quality - screen and hopefully extended battery life. \nThe Pixel 2 XL looks to be the higher spec phone that will be the better handset in general, but it also has that much higher price tag. It mostly comes down to how much you're willing to spend on a new phone from Google.

But Google\u2019s Pixel 2 is here, and looks to be a worthy successor to the original Pixel phone. \nGoogle\u2019s first Pixel was an impressive debut, and the Pixel 2 improves on it, leaning from any past mistakes. It could give Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8 some serious competition. \nLet\u2019s see how the two premium Android phones stack up against each other. Design \nFew phones can stand up to the design of a Samsung flagship phone, and that goes doubly for the Galaxy S8. It\u2019s thin, sleek, and features Samsung\u2019s incredible infinity display with curved edges and an incredibly screen-to-body ratio. Even though it has a 5.8-inch display, it\u2019s not a massive phone, with dimensions of 5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31 inches and a weight of just 155g. \nThe Pixel 2\u2019s design, in contrast, is nothing to drool over. It\u2019s simple and sleek, but doesn\u2019t have the same impressive curved-edge screen or screen-to-body ratio as the Galaxy S8. The screen is sandwiched between sizable bezels that many flagships are doing away with. \nBoth phones feature fingerprint scanners on the back. The Galaxy S8 scanner is awkwardly placed next to its rear camera, whereas the Pixel 2 scanner is more central, which could make it easier to find and naturally reach. And Google boasts having the fastest smartphone fingerprint scanner. The Galaxy S8 also has a heart rate scanner on the back and iris scanner on the front, features the Pixel 2 lacks. \nBoth the Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2 are water and dust resistant, but Samsung scores higher points with an IP68 rating compared to the Pixel 2\u2019s IP67. That means the Galaxy S8 can up to 30 minutes in about four feet of water, whereas the Pixel 2 shouldn\u2019t go deeper than three feet. Both phones are protected by Gorilla Glass 5, which should withstand drops onto a flat surface from about five feet up. \nNeither phone has much in the way of color options. In the US, the Galaxy S8 only comes in Orchid Grey or Midnight Black (though there are additional options abroad). The Pixel 2 comes in \"Clearly White\", \"Just Black\", and \u201cKinda Blue,\u201d giving it a slight edge. \nFor music lovers, the Galaxy S8 carries on the legacy of the 3.5mm headphone jack, though its built-in speaker isn\u2019t much for playback. On the other side, the Pixel 2 dumps the headphone jack in favor of the new wireless codecs for audio that come with Android 8.0 Oreo, and it has dual front speakers for stereo audio. In this case, the Pixel 2 gets another edge, as its lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack can be resolved with a dongle. Display \nJust as it's hard to beat a Samsung flagship, it\u2019s hard to beat a Samsung display. The Galaxy S8 packs in a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 2,960 x 1,440 and an insane pixel density of 570 pixels per inch (ppi). \nThe Pixel 2 also has an OLED display, but it will feel leagues behind at a small 5 inches and a resolution of just 1,920 x 1,080. These specs are more the kind to expect from a mid-range budget phone in 2017. \nFor VR and streaming, the Galaxy S8 display clearly wins out with its more impressive display, even though both phones are compatible with Google\u2019s Daydream VR. Despite its screen, the Pixel 2 may offer a better sound experience for watch movies and TV with its dual front-facing speakers. \nThe Pixel 2\u2019s Full HD display will help it save battery and processing power. But, the Galaxy S8 has the ability to downsample to Full HD for that same benefit, while the Pixel 2 can\u2019t add more pixels on a whim. OS and power \nOn the inside, the Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2 are packing similar internals. Both come with an octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset, though the international version of the Galaxy S8 runs an Exynos octa-core processor. The Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2 both have 4GB of RAM. They both similarly start with 64GB of storage for the base models. \nThe big difference lies in the operating system. Google\u2019s new Pixel 2 beats the Galaxy S8 to the latest Android 8.0 Oreo operating system, and that gives it a leg up, since Oreo features impressive power-saving optimizations, and boosts the boot speed of devices. The Pixel 2 also prominently features Google Assistant, and lets users access it by simply squeezing the phone with its Active Edge technology. \nThe Galaxy S8 is sure to eventually get Android Oreo, but currently it\u2019s still running Android 7.0 Nougat. Until then, the Pixel is likely to feel like a speedier device thanks to the same processing power running on a more efficient OS. Camera and Battery \nGoogle boasted the highest DxOMark score for a smartphone when it launched the first Pixel, and while we\u2019ll have to wait and see just how well it performs out in the wild, the Pixel 2\u2019s 12MP f/1.8 rear shooter exceeds the original's camera by scoring an even higher DxOMark score and topping all other smartphones once again. It also runs both optical and electronic image stabilization. The front-facing camera is an 8MP f/2.4 shooter, which should offer sharp selfies. \nThe Galaxy S8 is known for quality photos, just like past Galaxy devices. It features a 12MP rear camera with a fairly wide f/1.7 aperture and optical image stabilization. On the front, it has an 8MP f/1.7 selfie camera. \nBoth phones also have image recognition tools. Samsung has Bixby, which feels like more of a work-in-progress tool to help with shopping. Google is a bit further ahead with its AI, and Google Lens will help recognize photo subjects for organization and more. Google also puts its AI and dual pixel technology to work as a means of blurring out backgrounds similar to dual-lens systems. \nThe Galaxy S8 has an on-paper win for its battery, as it fits in a 3,000mAh battery compared to the Pixel 2\u2019s 2,700mAh battery. But, with the smaller and lower-resolution screen and the efficient OS of the Pixel, it\u2019s possible that it could get better battery life in actual daily use. Both phones include quick charging. Price \nA price comparison is a bit hard to make between these two devices. The starting price for the Galaxy S8 is US$724/AU$1,199, while the Pixel 2 is a lower US$649/AU$1,079 (and includes a Google Home Mini for a limited time, at least in the US). \nSince the Pixel 2 is brand new, discounts that bring that price down substantially are going to be rare in the near future. On the other hand, the Galaxy S8 has regularly seen deals since it launched, with many bringing it below the US$600 mark and some hitting US$570, not to mention persistent buy-one-get-one deals from carriers. \nWithout discounts, the Pixel 2 has an edge in the price competition, but Galaxy S8 prices have so frequently dipped, that it\u2019s hard to imagine not being able to regularly find the Galaxy S8 at a lower price than the Pixel 2. Takeaway \nThe battle between the Pixel 2 and Galaxy S8 appears to come down to form and function. With the same hardware inside, the phones are left to duke it out with their looks and capabilities. \nWhile we still have to see how well Android 8.0 Oreo performs on the Pixel 2, it's like the phone will take a win in that category. And, though the Galaxy S8 has a great camera, it didn't receive the same record high DxOMark score for camera performance that the Pixel 2 did. So, the Pixel 2 is likely winning in the camera department. Especially with Google's AI helping out. \nThe Galaxy S8 easily wins for visuals though. A vastly more impressive display and an elegant design make the Galaxy S8 look like it's in an entirely different league from the Pixel 2. \nUntil we review the Pixel 2 and know how well it works, we can't say for sure which phone wins, but the Pixel 2 is likely to be a more useful and capable phone than the Galaxy S8. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S8 will win for its design and screen quality.

In fact, this plus-sized phone visually stands out next to its smaller kin to such a degree that it might as well be a whole new product line.\nIt\u2019s not just the outside of the phone that has us excited. The specs, including the Snapdragon 835 processor, improvements made to the camera and the intriguing Active Edge feature, look to put it up against (and in some regards, beat down) the toughest round of competition ever put forward by leading manufacturers.\n\nBut as always, it comes down to this question: is the phone worth the cost? \nWhen it launches worldwide later this year, the Pixel 2 XL will ship for the hiked-up price of US$849/AU$1,399 (about \u00a3630) for the base 64GB model, while the 256GB is priced at US$949/AU$1,549 \u2013 we\u2019re getting close to the ceiling in terms of prices set by the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone X.\nWe\u2019ve had some time with Google\u2019s latest at its big event, and leading into our full review, we\u2019ll be updating this post with new impressions as we use the device, fresh photo samples and comparisons and more, so stay tuned.\nDesign, display and Active Edge Even if it was pure coincidence, the original Pixel XL certainly blended nicely into the crowd of iPhones, thanks to its generous bezels top and bottom. However, in the year following its debut, this style has quickly gone out the window in favor of the bezel-less look, with even Apple opting for a high screen-to-body ratio with the iPhone X.\nSo, rather than risk of getting left behind in the last big announcement of the year, it makes sense that the Google Pixel 2 XL would adopt a similar look. And what a refresh this is. Compared to the smaller 5-inch Google Pixel 2, the larger 6-inch version, which now costs a whopping $200 more, provides a decent amount of reason for the price madness.\nStarting with the bezels (or the lack thereof), Google\u2019s new phone mostly clears them from view to put the focus on the display \u2013 an improved P-OLED display that features a polarized display that can be viewed easily with sunglasses.\nNot surprisingly, the new device improves on the original's with the 2,880 x 1,440 resolution (QHD+), which makes it, once again, the better of Google\u2019s two 2017 options for virtual reality via the Google Daydream View headset.\n\nOn its face, the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s bezel layout makes for a similar look to the LG V30 and LG G6. Given that very company poured work into the latest Google phablet, this comes as little surprise, and thankfully, the Pixel 2 XL stands out easily so that you won\u2019t confuse the phones.\nTearing our eyes away from the display (admittedly, a hard thing to do), the rest of the phone has received some big updates that are worth mentioning. \nFirst, let\u2019s address the elephant in the room: neither the Pixel 2 or the Pixel 2 XL feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. These aren\u2019t the first Android phones to omit the legacy port, but given that it made a pointed jab at Apple for doing so last year, there\u2019s a bit of egg on Google\u2019s face right about now.\nHowever, it\u2019s less than you might think given that Android Oreo supports plenty of high-quality wireless audio codecs. This doesn\u2019t excuse the decision, but as opposed to citing \u201ccourage\u201d as its inspiration, Google appears to have accounted for the change by working to solve the greater issue of a bad wireless experience, which we're all for. Plus, it's tossing a 3.5mm to USB-C adaptor in the box.\n\nAdditionally, it has announced the Google Pixel Buds, which could be a good wireless solution if you happen to have $159 around. They're most interesting than your average headphones though, as they live-translate languages.\nMoving right along, the edges of the Pixel 2 XL are rounded off, offering a single, smooth texture instead of the divisive, multi-layered mix of chamfered and glossy metal used in 2016\u2019s model. As usual, the right side of the smartphone plays host to the volume rocker and power button, with each delivering an optimal amount of tactility when pressed. \n\nThis sounds like a silly thing to pass judgment on, but in past years the hardware buttons on Nexus phones haven\u2019t yielded the longest lifespan for remaining clicky. Thankfully, we haven\u2019t experienced any issues whatsoever in its Pixel lineup, and this new phone appears to be no exception, though it\u2019s an issue that usually takes months to manifest itself. \nMoreover, the Pixel 2 XL features a new button of sorts that's impervious to whittling away: its Active Edge feature, which lets you squeeze the phone\u2019s frame to issue a command. \nWant to boot into the camera app or pull up Google Assistant? Just give the phone a light or hard squeeze, the intensity of which you can determine yourself.\nYou might remember that this feature first popped up as Edge Sense in the HTC U11, and now it\u2019s been swallowed up in the Pixel 2 XL. While some may stick to using buttons and on-screen prompts, Active Edge is an important new feature that adds a fun, new element of navigation to stock Android, which has the reputation of being a bit stale to some who prefer custom launchers. \nFlipped over on its back, the same split, two-toned design of aluminum and glass carries forward into 2017\u2019s Pixel devices, and it\u2019s less divisive than before. My colleagues had some tough words for the original Pixel\u2019s look, calling it \u201cpeculiar\u201d and \u201cpremium, if slightly odd\u201d. I personally don\u2019t agree, though I can see where they\u2019re coming from. That being said, this melding of materials on the Pixel 2 XL is much more harmonious.\n\nThe fingerprint sensor now sits below the glass fold, with only the large rear-facing camera, flash and accompanying sensors sitting within the glass. The slight camera bump might be seen as a flaw to some, but we\u2019re in support of Google raising the camera sensor out a bit, as it prevents the horrors that are endured when the original Pixel\u2019s rear glass cracks.\nPerformance Early rumors pointed to the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL being the first phones to launch with a next-gen Snapdragon processor, but that didn\u2019t come to pass. Alas, both smartphones feature 2017\u2019s go-to flagship workhorse, the Snapdragon 835. \nPaired with 4GB of RAM, the Pixel 2 XL might not seem like it\u2019s gunning for prime position in the numbers race, but of course we\u2019ve yet to see what this phone is capable of in real-world testing. \nLast year\u2019s Pixel XL is equipped with the Snapdragon 821, and we\u2019re still pretty pleased with the performance eked from it, so given Google\u2019s recent work to build a name for itself in internal chipset development, our guess is that this phone has some unique performance tricks up its sleeve.\n\nOf course, this smartphone will already be ahead of the greater pack of Android flagships at launch thanks to it coming with Android Oreo out of the box. You can expect super-fast boot times, optimized background app usage and, perhaps, a few more interesting Pixel-exclusive features coming down the line as Oreo matures.\nThe Pixel 2 XL\u2019s camera and battery are well worth a discussion, though we won\u2019t know what each is truly capable of until we spend more time with the phone.\nStarting with the cameras, Google has gone the extra mile to make its already-stellar camera even better \u2013 it's a 12MP sensor with an aperture of f/1.8 to capture low-light shots better, whether it be in the haze of night or a dark concert hall. On its front, Google has stuck with an 8MP sensor.\nGoogle showed off its Google Lens and ARCore capabilities, both of which are coming to Pixel first. More to come on that later on, but definitely worth a lengthy discussion.\nMoving onto the battery, as surprisingly efficient as the Snapdragon 835 has proved itself to be in the past year, we always like to see more battery in our phones, not less (staring daggers at the Moto Z2 Force). The Pixel 2 XL has been boosted ever so slightly to 3,520mAh over 3,450mAh used in the original XL. \nAs a result, the 2 XL is very likely to be the popular choice among those who want to use Daydream for longer and, well, just do everything else for longer, too. We're asking around about official battery capacity.\nWe\u2019ll have to perform more testing to see if the pairing of its QHD+ display and larger battery will win out versus the Pixel 2\u2019s 1080p screen and smaller battery, or if we\u2019re looking at equal projected lifespans between the two \u2013 something that many have said about the first batch of Pixels.\nEarly verdict 2017 is a hellish year (in that it\u2019s the best ever) to decide on a new smartphone, and Google certainly hasn\u2019t made it any easier with the Pixel 2 XL. \nBut thanks to some smart reconfigurations on both the design and internals fronts, plus a few extra surprises, like Active Edge and its seemingly killer camera, this smartphone could be the one you\u2019ve been waiting for since, if you\u2019re like me, last year\u2019s Google Pixel. \nThis new device appears to have made improvements where it needed them most (performance and design), as well as in areas where it already had a comfortable lead (camera, software). \nDespite these welcome additions to the Pixel formula, the most unwelcome ingredient is its new price tag, which starts at $849. The divide between the smaller Pixel 2 is wider now: $200 instead of $120. \nIs the jump worth it to you? Until we know for sure how the XL\u2019s battery and chipset perform under pressure, check out our guide that might just help make that very decision an easy one.\nWhat is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

You get more than 20 locations, a free plan gives you 500MB a month of data \u2013 1GB if you register \u2013 and the commercial plans support unlimited mobile devices for $3.33 (\u00a32.66) a month over a year, or $5 (\u00a34) a month to cover desktops as well.\nMobile users get the VitalSecurityVPN browser. Features include logon via a custom passcode or biometric authentication. Banners tell you whether pages are safe, suspect or dangerous. There's detailed information on trackers, and the browser can block any or all trackers and ads.\nThe mobile browser comes with a complete VPN which covers all other apps. Windows and Mac users can also install this, although they just get a VPN client \u2013 there's no browser.\nWant to try VitalSecurityVPN? Check out the website here None of this is exactly revolutionary. Many of the browser features are available with other products, and the VPN isn't anything new: it's essentially Avira's Phantom VPN with a new mobile shell.\nThe most interesting element here is probably the provider. Finjan isn't just another internet startup: it's been around since 1996, developing and patenting some major technologies, including the behaviour-based security system which it licenced to Microsoft in 2005. This is a company which knows what it's doing, and that alone makes VitalSecurityVPN worth a closer look.\n\nPrivacy VitalSecurityVPN only provides a very general logging policy: \"We do not keep any records or monitor your traffic and sites you visit.\" That's reassuring, but the best services give us a lot more detail.\nFinjan is based on Avira's Phantom VPN, which does provide some extra privacy-related information on its own site. This isn't guaranteed to apply to VitalSecurityVPN, but it's a starting point.\nAvira says that PhantomVPN doesn't log your real IP address (when you connect) or the virtual IP addresses you're allocated within a session, the websites you visit, or \"any information that can link you to any action, such as downloading a file, or visiting a particular website.\"\nPhantomVPN does log the amount of data you've used, whether you're a free or paid user, and \u2013 optionally \u2013 \u2018diagnostic data\u2019, which typically means details like program crashes or connection errors. There's nothing surprising in that, and many VPNs record considerably more.\nFinjan's general privacy policy has some issues. Personal data might be used to \"provide offers... by third parties\", and the company \"may use advertising service providers to serve Finjan advertisements on other websites or resources that you visit or use\". This isn't ideal, but it's also very common, and has no effect on your privacy while connected to the service.\nPerformance VitalSecurityVPN installed without any difficulty on our Android device. We launched it with a tap and it fired up a very simple tutorial covering the basics.\nEnabling the VPN is simple, and a couple of taps will connect you to the nearest location. Alternatively, you can choose from more than 20 locations across North America and Europe, along with Brazil, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia.\nThe app connected quickly during testing, and it began to update in real-time to show the amount of data we'd used. If you're hoping to use the very limited 500MB/1GB free plan, that's going to be a very important detail.\nThere are no significant low-level VPN settings. You can't set ports, change the protocol or do anything else even faintly advanced. That could be a plus for someone who only needs the basics, but experienced users might be frustrated by the lack of control.\nThe browser's VPN interface is straightforward. Tap to connect, an icon lights up to tell you when you're online or if the connection drops, and you're able to switch back at any time to check on data use or close the connection.\nVisit any URL and the browser accesses 60+ top databases of malicious, phishing and other dubious sites, then briefly displays its 'safe', 'suspect' or 'dangerous' verdict on a banner at the bottom of the screen.\nMost of the time you don't really notice this \u2013 it's just a green notification which disappears within a few seconds \u2013 but if it indicates a problem, tapping the banner displays a VirusTotal-type report which tells you which engines flagged the site.\nVitalSecurityVPN also highlights its anti-tracker feature, but this is turned off by default, and the app warns you that turning it on can \"slow down the browser\" and \"in rare cases can cause a website to fail to load.\"\nWe enabled tracker monitoring anyway and visited a few ad-packed sites. A figure at the bottom right of the screen told us how many trackers were on the current page, and tapping this gave us details on the type of trackers (analytics, advertising and so on) and enabled some or all of these to be blocked.\nCould this protect your privacy? Maybe, but there are plenty of other apps and extensions which do something similar, and the fact that it's turned off by default suggests even Finjan doesn't believe it's essential.\nWhat's more important here is performance, and our regular benchmarks tests* showed mixed results. UK to UK download speeds were a reasonable 25 to 30Mbps, but connecting to Europe saw speeds drop to a disappointing 10Mbps or less in many locations. UK to US performance was much better at 20 to 25Mbps, and if you're on a mobile device this may all be good enough, but the best commercial VPNs will deliver more.\nFortunately, there was more positive news with our final privacy tests. VitalSecurityVPN passed with ease, concealing our IP, replacing our regular DNS and successfully blocking any identity leaks, keeping us safe from snoopers.\nFinal verdict VitalSecurityVPN is really just a new shell for Avira's Phantom VPN, and although it's not a bad service, it's hard to see why you would pay for it. The free mobile browser is more interesting, though, with some useful security features and a 4.5-star rating on the app stores \u2013 it\u2019s worth a look.\nThe best VPN services of 2017 * Our testing included evaluating general performance (browsing, streaming video). We also used speedtest.net to measure latency, upload and download speeds, and then tested immediately again with the VPN turned off, to check for any difference (over several rounds of testing). We then compared these results to other VPN services we've reviewed. Of course, do note that VPN performance is difficult to measure as there are so many variables .\nBest VPN for China Best VPN for Mac Best VPN for torrenting Best VPN for Android Best VPN for Windows Best VPN for Netflix Best VPN for Canada Best VPN for Kodi Best VPN for business Best VPN for Australia Best VPN for iPhone/iOS Best VPN for Chrome Best VPN for India Best VPN for gaming", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avira", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vpn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kodi best vpn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finjan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada best vpn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T22:08:23.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4b899763b467f4f51820e03d4b70a1105380d0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3RuwlObRIjxTFEWNWzgve6XmL3FcUJhUoYDXHG.aBF8gBO.AUFYvrE3S4T2L1VUZUIL3REu1SUmM-", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/news", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar news and features | TechRadar", "title": "XL vs Samsung Galaxy Note 8", "title_full": "Google Pixel 2 XL vs Samsung Galaxy Note 8 | TechRadar", "published": "2017-10-04T20:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uo6ccvrbDv3etQ34SrC6SZ-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 170, "comments": 0, "shares": 170}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4b899763b467f4f51820e03d4b70a1105380d0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG3RuwlObRIjxTFEWNWzgve6XmL3FcUJhUoYDXHG.aBF8gBO.AUFYvrE3S4T2L1VUZUIL3REu1SUmM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mark Knapp", "published": "2017-10-04T20:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "XL vs Samsung Galaxy Note 8", "text": "Google Pixel 2 XL vs Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Google Pixel 2 XL vs Samsung Galaxy Note 8 This competition may be too close Shares \nThe Galaxy Note 8 is Samsung\u2019s latest, greatest, and biggest smartphone. But, with the Google Pixel 2 XL finally arriving, it has to go head-to-head with the maker of Android\u2019s best Android smartphone. \nSamsung may consistently sit at the top of the pack, but last year Google came out strong with the first Pixel phones. And if the Pixel 2 XL is a worth successor to the original, it could challenge the Note 8 on many levels. Check out our early look at the new Google Pixel 2 XL in our first hands on \nLet\u2019s take a close look at what each of the phones offer and see which is standing strongest so far. Design \nThis year, the Galaxy Note 8 got the best of everything, as Samsung carried the elegant curved glass display from its Galaxy S8 series over to the Note line. The result is a huge glass display with almost no bezel in sight. The Note 8 features curved glass on the back as well, and frames all of this with a metal edge wrapping around the phone. \nEven though the Galaxy Note 8 packs a 6.3-inch display, it manages not to feel excessively large because it still only measures 162.5 x 74.8 x 8.6mm thanks to the trimmed bezels. It doesn\u2019t even end up very heavy, weighing just 195g. \nThe Pixel 2 XL doesn\u2019t have the same design spice as the Galaxy Note 8. It has slim bezels, but not the same nearly non-existent bezels as the Note 8. It maintains the quirky back design of last year\u2019s Pixel phones with a metal lower section and glass upper section. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the design, but it still feels a bit last-year compared to the sleek Note 8. \nBoth phones feature fingerprint scanners on the back. Samsung positions its scanner next to the dual-lens camera and heart rate sensor, which can be an unfortunately awkward spot to reach. In contrast, the Pixel 2 XL has its fingerprint scanner closer to the middle of the phone\u2019s rear, so it will likely be easier for users to find without flipping their phone over or smudging their camera lens. And, Google boasts that it's the fastest smartphone fingerprint scanner. \nThe Note 8 and Pixel 2 XL offer similar levels of protection with Gorilla Glass 5, which should prevent a shattered screen on both phones from drops of 5 feet onto a flat surface. The Pixel XL 2 has an IP67 rating against water and dust ingress, so it can handle a dunk in three feet of water for 30 minutes. The Note 8 gains an edge here, as it has an IP68 rating, letting it go about a foot deeper for the same 30 minutes underwater. \nFor audio, the Galaxy Note 8 keeps the old-school tried-and-true 3.5mm jack for wired headphones. It has a bottom-firing speaker, but it\u2019s nothing to get excited about. The Pixel 2 XL doesn\u2019t have the 3.5mm jack, but a dongle can fix that. What it does have is a pair of front-facing speakers at the top and bottom of the screen for serious stereo sound. On top of that, the Pixel 2 XL will have advanced wireless codecs for improved audio with wireless headphones thanks to Android 8.0 Oreo. \nThe two phones are on even footing for color options, so the winner will come down to simple preference and where you live. The Galaxy Note 8 is available in Orchid Grey and Midnight Black in the US, though more colors are available for the international version. The Pixel 2 XL has \u201cJust Black\u201d and \u201cBlack & White\u201d as color options. Display \nThe display competition is a close one. The Galaxy Note 8 loads a 6.3-inch ultra-widescreen Super AMOLED display that takes up the vast majority of the phone\u2019s front. It sports a resolution of 2,960 x 1,440 for a super crisp pixel density of 521 pixels per inch. \nThe Pixel 2 XL has a slightly smaller 6-inch pOLED display with a resolution of 2,880 x 1,440. This results in a great pixel density, but at these screen sizes, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to notice the difference in density between the two phones, even in virtual reality. \nWhile the Note 8 has a phenomenal display and the Pixel 2 XL will likely earn that same distinction in our reviews, the winner is likely to be the Note 8. It\u2019s hard to beat Samsung when it comes to top-of-the-line displays. \nBoth phones will have great pictures, and thanks to OLED technology they\u2019ll offer brilliant contrast ratios for video playback. But, Samsung\u2019s display is likely to be the more dazzling option, especially thanks to the curved glass edges. \nIt\u2019s also worth factoring in that the Galaxy Note 8 has the S Pen stylus, which opens the door for unique features and easy note-taking. OS and power \nThe Galaxy Note 8 is powered by the same chipset as the Galaxy S8, an octa-core Snapdragon 835 in the US and a octa-core Exynos 8895 for the international version. But it steps up its performance with 6GB of RAM. \nThe Pixel 2 XL stands on an even footing with the Note 8 for processing power, as it also has a Snapdragon 835 chipset. However, it only comes with 4GB of RAM. Though, average mobile users may struggle to notice a serious difference between the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s 4GB of RAM and the Note 8\u2019s 6GB. \nBoth the Pixel 2 XL and Galaxy Note 8 base models start with 64GB of internal storage. But the Note 8 offers extra-affordable storage with its microSD card slot. \nFor at least a little while, the Pixel 2 XL is going to gain an advantage over the Note 8 in terms of operating systems. The Note 8 is currently running Android 7.1.1 Nougat, while the Pixel 2 XL starts straightaway on Android 8.0 Oreo. \nOn top of Android Oreo being more optimized than Nougat, it\u2019s a safe bet that Google has done a great job optimizing Android Oreo performance on the Pixel 2 XL. So, it should run incredibly smooth, and beat the Note 8 on boot times. Google Assistant is also expected to play a large role in using the Pixel 2 XL, and Google has made it easy to access with the Active Edge technology. A simple squeeze of the phone will active Google Assistant. Camera and Battery \nAfter the fiasco of the incendiary Galaxy Note 7 batteries, Samsung hasn\u2019t gone wild with the Note 8. It as a 3,300mAh battery that should usually last for a day of use. The battery is capable of fast charging and can even be charged wirelessly. \nThe Pixel XL 2 is likely going to win in the battery contest once we\u2019ve tested it out. It comes with a 3,520mAh battery, topping the Note 8 by a decent margin. Factor in that the Pixel XL 2 has the same processor and a smaller display with fewer pixels to power, and Google\u2019s phone will probably last longer between recharges than the Note 8. \nThe camera is another contest that will be hard to call before we have a chance to test the new Pixel 2 XL camera. \nSamsung is always bringing best-in-class smartphone cameras, and the Galaxy Note 8 is no exception. It has a dual-lens setup with a 12MP f/1.7 wide-angle lens and a 12MP f/2.4 telephoto lens. Both camera sensors include optical image stabilization, so the shooting experience is great on both. Samsung has added some special features for the dual cameras, including the ability to adjust depth of field before and after taking a picture and an option to take a close-up photo and a wide-angle photo at the same time. \nThough the Pixel 2 XL only has a single 12MP rear camera, it could still dazzle us. Last year\u2019s Pixel came with the highest DxOMark score for a smartphone camera at the time, and the new camera sets the bar for smartphone cameras even higher. While it only has the one rear camera, it includes optical and electronic image stabilization, and thanks to dual pixel technology and Google's AI, it can create a portrait effect like dual-lens cameras do. \nFor selfie-lover, the Galaxy Note 8 has a sharp 8MP front-facing camera, and the Pixel 2 XL keeps up with its own 8MP selfie shooter that features the same portrait mode as the rear camera. \nIt\u2019s worth noting that both phones have special image recognition software. Google Lens will help the Pixel 2 XL identify camera subjects and can pull in Google Assistant to get more information about the photo, add it to a calendar, or more. It can even translate text. The Note 8 comes with Samsung\u2019s Bixby personal assistant that can recognize imagery, but it\u2019s not yet quite as smart as Google\u2019s AI. Price \nSize comes at a price, and so does design. The Galaxy Note 8 starts at a painful US$929/AU$1499, making it one of the most expensive smartphones coming from a non-niche manufacturer. The Pixel 2 XL doesn\u2019t come all that much cheaper, with a starting price of US$849/AU$1,399 (for a limited time, that includes a free Google Home Mini, at least in the US). \nThe price difference between the Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2 was a bit more of an even match because discounts and buy-one-get-one deals frequently make the Galaxy S8 more affordable than its list price suggests. However, both the Note 8 and Pixel 2 XL are still firmly on this side of new, and tangible discounts will be hard to find. \nIt\u2019s hard to say one phone of these two wins in the price war though, as that $80 extra for the Note 8 comes with an S Pen, curved glass display, headphone jack, 2GB of extra RAM, better water-resistance, a second camera, a heart rate sensor and an even bigger and high-resolution display. \nSo, while the Pixel 2 XL costs US$80 less, it also costs the loss of a lot of extra goodies. Takeaway \nThe competition between the Note 8 and Pixel 2 XL is a little tougher to call than the one between the Galaxy S8 and Pixel 2 . \nIn terms of the hardware and software working together, it seems like the Pixel 2 XL might gain the advantage thanks to Google Assistant and Android 8.0 Oreo. But, the Note 8's extra 2GB of RAM and S Pen capabilities could even the score. \nUntil we test the cameras, it's also tough to say which phone has the better camera. DxOMark clearly puts the Google Pixel 2 XL at the top of the pack, but the Galaxy Note 8 camera offers incredibly photography. \nBoth phones also offer displays that should be so sharp it's hard to spot a difference. The difference between an AMOLED display in the Note 8 and pOLED display in the Pixel 2 XL will be interesting to see, but it's too early to say if one beats the other. \nThe Pixel 2 XL does look a little more modern than its smaller sibling, but the Note 8 has a more striking design thanks to the curved display, so we still give it the lead aesthetic. \nUntil we can review the Pixel 2 XL, this race is too close to call.

Our Early Verdict \nThese clever buds impress with fit and power, but we would have loved to have seen truly wireless options. For Good fit in the ear Against Cord can slip Hard to put in case \nThe Google Pixel Ear Bluetooth headphones are designed to complement the colors and look of the new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, while bringing their own translating smarts to the table as well. \nThe first thing you'll notice is that, unlike Samsung's and Apple's 'true wireless' offerings, there's a cord hanging in between the two noise-makers \u2013 while these buds are wireless, they're not truly so. \nHowever, that cord does have some clever uses... not least meaning it'll be harder to lose your earbuds, and you can hang them around your neck when they're not in use. \nThe design is fairly standard for a set of earbuds, to be honest, with the rubberized outer fitting nicely into the ear, and a flanged bud inside sealing the sound in nicely. \nThe cord has a neat trick: slide it upwards and you'll be able to make a small 'wing' that holds it in your ear perfectly... being able to customize like this is a really nice trick. \nThe sound quality seems more than acceptable, with the design of the buds not being truly noise-isolating, but still enough to put a decent roar into your ears. \nWe were, irritatingly, stuffed into a noisy demo area, so couldn't push them to their natural limits, but what we heard was pretty rich and offered a decent level of bass. \nThe headphones are compatible with any device that supports Bluetooth playback, but are best used with the Pixel \u2013 they'll insta-pair with the new device from Google in the same way Apple's AirPods do when you open the case for the first time. \nIt's not the first time that Google has taken its cues from Apple, but it's a slick system. You'll even, apparently, be able to use Siri with the Buds, but they're best used with the Google phones. \nThe outsides of the headphones are touch-sensitive, so you can hold to access the Assistant, swipe forwards and backwards to alter volume and swipe up and down to skip tracks. It's a simple system. \nSadly, as they aren't finished units, we couldn't try out the Google Assistant functionality, so we've yet to find out just how good they are at enabling you to communicate in foreign languages. \nWhether you need it really is the bigger question, as while it is a properly futuristic thing to have, we can't say that we regularly want to talk to people in a different language. \nIt'll also need two people using Pixel Buds together to have a truly multi-lingual conversation, which is pretty unlikely. Plus we can see it being difficult to explain to someone that we're using them as a translation tool if we can't speak the language. \nThe charging box, which doubles as a case for the headphones, is a little irritating. The outside feels a little flimsy (again, though, we were trying pre-production units), and while the battery life is good for five hours on the Pixel Buds from a single charge (and you can get multiple juices from keeping them in the case) having to wrap the cables around the outside is tedious. \nThey don't even fit flush around the outside, with a small amount of cable having to go inside the case... it's workable, but something you need to get used to. Early verdict \nThese are cool little buds, and we need to spend more time testing out the translation function and audio quality to get a feel for the real-life experience with them \u2013 they have some unique features that other earbuds lack, but that doesn't necessarily make them the best on the market. \nBut from a design and fit point of view, they're good; a little expensive perhaps, but overall still a decent idea from Google, and likely to entice people who are worried about losing separate wireless buds.

Back again? It's the Daydream View from Google. It doesn't have a new name, but it does have some slightly new design upgrades to make it a little more exciting to purchase. \nIt's ultimately still just a dumb vessel for your smartphone to show off Google's world of VR, but it's fixed a few of the issues we had with the older model and has become more desirable as a result. Daydream VR (2017) release date and price Available to buy from October 19, pre-orders open now Will cost \u00a399 / $99 (around AU$125) \nIf you're looking to get your hands on the new virtual reality headset from Google, you'll be paying a little more than before. \nWhere it originally landed for $79 / \u00a369, now you'll be paying the princely sum of $99 / \u00a399, although it's hard to see where the extra cost is coming from. \nYou'll be able to buy it fairly soon though. The new VR headset is available to pre-order alongside the new Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL today, with the Google Daydream View (2017) release date set for October 19. New design \nThe Google Daydream View needed an update, as the first model was heavy, hot and, most importantly, had light bleed thanks to the slight gap between the front flap and the phone locked into the headset. \nThis meant that not only was it not flush to the device, which is a little unsightly, but it didn't give the best viewing experience. \nThat's been improved a lot since, with some nice flourishes making this a more comfortable headset to wear. \nThe first is that the new strap that sits on top of the head and holds the entire unit in place is much better \u2013 it's still a long way from perfect, and dug in a little in our demo, but until we try it for an extended watching session it's hard to know if this will be a problem. \nThe unit did sit more nicely on the face though, with a more padded and comfortable face place to squish your lovely visage into, which also provided a more immersive experience. \nThere's a small vent on the front for the section that holds the phone in place, and we didn't see any light bleeding in during our VR demo \u2013 in short, it's a much better-designed headset than before. Updated controller \nThe new controller isn't hugely different to the previous model, although it is a little sleeker. \nIt sadly doesn't clip inside the front flap, presumably to make sure that it sits more sleekly to the front of the headset. Instead, it slips neatly into the strap on the back of the headset, holding in place when the headset is not in use. \nIt's a decent little device, with gyroscopes inside meaning it'll show up in your virtual world and you'll be able to move it and flip it over just like in real life. \nThis is nothing new, nor is the layout of the device, but it's comfortable and light to hold and use \u2013 all the buttons are raised and easily found with a blind finger, and it functions perfectly as a pointer in the VR realm. VR still needs work \nThe big issue with Daydream VR is that it's not a fully-fledged experience yet. It's fine being able to watch concerts in VR and spin your head around, as well as play more immersive racing games, but we can't say that it's an indispensable experience. \nThe apps we tried out weren't that exciting, and the whole Daydream design inside the virtual world is fairly cartoonish. It's impressive that it's running off a phone, and hopefully the new crop of Android handsets won't be as heavy and unpleasant to hold on the face, but we can't say that we felt a huge amount of enjoyment playing inside the new Daydream View. \nHowever, we definitely need to spend some more time playing with the device, as there are far more apps available compared to the first model, so perhaps some third-party developers have come up with some solid gold. Early verdict \nThe first Daydream View was a decent-enough headset, although didn't really support enough phones to be a huge success (although the addition of the Samsung Galaxy S8 / Note 8 range helped a lot), and the new headset is a little better in a few ways. \nThe new design is sleeker and more comfortable, which is thoroughly welcomed, and the whole experience feels more immersive than before. \nThat said, the cost is higher, and that's an issue \u2013 there's not a lot of must-have content available that we can see right now, so this continues to be a niche product that's fun to play with once, but isn't going to be something you'll use regularly. \nWe do need to try it out further to really find out if the VR experience has improved, but for more money the Daydream View has to impress in new ways.

The Google Pixelbook is, by far, the best Chromebook made to date. However, you\u2019re going to pay dearly for a Chromebook holding that title. \nThankfully, judging by our time with the device, the steep price of entry is well worth it for the first Chromebook with 100% complete Android app support, Google\u2019s new Chrome launcher and a wholly impressive new stylus experience. Oh, and the keyboard is stellar, too. \nThis is the Chromebook set to inspire the next batch of laptops using Chrome OS in the same way the Surface Pro line has informed the path of Windows 10 devices. And, much like the Surface Pro, it\u2019s well worth it to hop on the next wave of Chromebooks at its first swell. Spec Sheet \nHere is the Google Pixelbook configuration sent to TechRadar for review: \nCPU : 1.2GHz Intel Core i5-7Y57 (dual-core, 4MB cache, up to 3.3GHz) Graphics : Intel HD Graphics 615 RAM : 8GB LPDDR3 (1,866MHz) Screen : 12.3-inch QHD (2,400 x 1,600, 235 ppi) LCD touchscreen (400 nits, 72% NTSC color, 3:2 aspect ratio) Storage : 256GB SSD (eMMC) Ports : 2x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3), headphone/mic jack Connectivity : 802.11ac Wi-Fi (2 x 2 MIMO), Bluetooth 4.2 Cameras : 720p webcam (60fps) Weight : 2.4 pounds (1.1kg) Size : 11.4 x 8.7 x 0.4 inches (290.4 x 220.8 x 10.3mm; W x D x H) Price and availability \nLet\u2019s make no bones about it: the Google Pixelbook is a really pricey Chromebook. Starting at $999 (\u00a3999, about AU$1,295) and capping out at $1,649 (\u00a31,699, about AU$2,138) \u2013 without even counting the $99 (\u00a399, about AU$128) Pixelbook Pen \u2013 this is a premium Chromebook with a premium price to match. \n(At the time of writing, the Google Pixelbook is not yet available in Australia.) \nFor that money, you\u2019re getting 7th generation Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 processors on both the entry-level 128GB option and $1,199 (\u00a31,199, about AU$1,555) mid-range 256GB option, each paired with 8GB of memory. However, the top-end 512GB option comes packing a Core i7 processor with 16GB of memory. All of these processor options are Intel\u2019s low-power, low-heat Y series chips, which means all of the Pixelbook models are fanless. \nNow, let\u2019s talk about how this stacks up against this year\u2019s Samsung Chromebook Pro and Asus Chromebook Flip , both of which were designed in close conjunction with Google to jumpstart the firm\u2019s Android app push on Chrome OS. Both of these laptops are considerably less expensive, with Samsung and Asus\u2019s currently selling for $499 (about \u00a3375, AU$647) and $459 (\u00a3675, AU$899), respectively. \nHowever, they\u2019re both considerably less powerful, housing the same 6th generation Intel Core m3 processor that\u2019s similarly designed for low power, and thus low heat, use in fanless chassis designs. That said, they\u2019re both gorgeous Chromebooks in their own right, albeit offering far less local storage and memory. \nIn the end, these two Chromebooks are a better deal for what the Chromebook platform is today, but that\u2019s not really what the Pixelbook is about. The Google Pixelbook is to Chromebooks of the future what Microsoft\u2019s Surface line was to 2-in-1 Windows 10 devices that followed it. Design \nThe Pixelbook is clearly the beautiful result of years of work on Google\u2019s part in refining a unified design across its hardware offerings. But, also, the Pixelbook could be seen as a coming-of-age for Google\u2019s own Chromebook design. \nThis is, indisputably, Google\u2019s most attractive and well-conceived computing device yet. From the brushed aluminum frame with flush edges to the rubberized palm rest and underside, every design element has achieved style and substance in equal measure. \nOf course, just two Thunderbolt 3 ports is going to take some adjustment for anyone that hasn\u2019t bought a laptop in a few years. But, at least it\u2019s more than ready for the future. Speaking of which, the webcam is equally prepared for an increasingly video-centric future with a 720p resolution and 60 frames-per-second capture rate. \nSadly, the same can\u2019t be said of the audio performance. As has become the growing trend in the thinnest and lightest laptops, Google crammed the speakers beneath the keyboard, and the result is awfully tinny sound. Luckily, there\u2019s a 3.5mm audio jack here that allows you to hook up the Pixelbook to external speakers or a pair of earphones. \nOn the upside, the glass trackpad is a delight to use, tracking super smoothly and accurately both with single- and-multi-touch gestures. However, we found that the trackpad doesn\u2019t like us resting our thumb on the trackpad to click while tracking with our index finger \u2013 a common use case, but not this editor\u2019s personal preference. \nLikewise, the Pixelbook keyboard is among the best we\u2019ve ever tested. The backlit keyboard\u2019s keys are well-spaced, and the 0.8mm travel is a delight with forceful feedback. We also appreciate the subtle, deeply satisfying clicking sound the keys make \u2013 it\u2019s distinct from every laptop keyboard we\u2019ve tested, and now we\u2019re going to expect it everywhere. \nThe \u2018Pixel\u2019 in Google\u2019s eponymous laptop earns its name when it comes to the 3:2 Pixelbook display. At 235 pixels-per-inch (ppi) and accurate color reproduction, this display rivals some of the best around, Chromebook or not, like the 267-ppi Surface Pro and 227-ppi MacBook Pro (13-inch). \nThe panel works well for movies and photos, not to mention photo editing. The 400 nits of brightness help hugely with this, but it\u2019s still a glossy screen and as such doesn\u2019t stand up to direct sunlight all that well. At any rate, the display is also sharply accurate to the touch, especially when underneath the Pixelbook Pen. Pixelbook Pen and Google Assistant \nFirst off, we\u2019ll just say that it\u2019s a damn shame that the Pixelbook Pen isn\u2019t included in the price of the laptop, as it\u2019s arguably crucial to the experience. However, we\u2019re not about the say that the stylus isn\u2019t worth the price of admission, because it 100% is worth it \u2013 if you can spare it. \nThe Pixelbook Pen works excellently as a stylus, offering plenty of pressure response as well as tilt support, making drawing on the display a pleasure. The display\u2019s snappy response helps the digital ink follow close enough behind the pen that any delay is imperceivable. \nOn the Pixelbook Pen sits a single button which is essentially a Google Assistant button, but also seems to incorporate some of the new Google Lens technology found in smartphones, like the Google Pixel 2 . Pressing the button while inking turns that ink into a thick blue, but doesn\u2019t actually draw anything. \nInstead, anything captured inside this blue ink is sent to Google Assistant for analysis, which in turn presents anything and everything Google\u2019s servers can muster about whatever you encircled. Circle a picture of a hippopotamus, and Google Assistant will hit you with a Wikipedia page on the animal. In fact, Google\u2019s knowledge graph runs so deep that we circled a picture of Office Space\u2019s Ron Livingston, and Google Assistant spat back his character\u2019s name \u2013 Peter Gibbons \u2013 before telling us more about the actor. \nThis will be an incredibly powerful tool for students, particularly, but users in general will benefit. \nAnother plus regarding the Pixelbook Pen is that it\u2019s opened up Google Keep to support pen input, even from the lock screen, making note-taking that much easier. There are even apps that can transcribe the Pixelbook Pen\u2019s scrawlings into traditional text. \nHowever, one huge flaw in the Pixelbook Pen is that it doesn\u2019t attach to the laptop in any way, not even via magnets, like the Surface Pro. This oversight makes it that much easier to lose this stylus that cost you so much money. Plus, it runs on AAAA batteries, whereas a rechargeable solution would\u2019ve been much more worthy of the price tag. \nAs for Google Assistant, the service can be accessed either through a dedicated keyboard button or via your voice, if you don\u2019t invest in the Pixelbook Pen. Though, the latter only works when the laptop is logged into \u2013 waking the Pixelbook with a \u2018Hey, Google\u2019 command is in the works, we\u2019re told. \nIn general, Google Assistant is just as helpful as it is on smartphones and renders in the exact same way, with an OS-level chat record as well as a voice response. 1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pixelbook pen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pixelbook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snapchat", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google pixelbook glass", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google chromebook pixel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chromebook pixel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft surface laptop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung chromebook pro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google pixel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google pixelbook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pixelbook", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T23:18:50.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efdb5fe985db108770b870169821799b4606e683", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG32vBQgddSn3Ho_JvEoXpT4lZuYGYQ.KEvkg1v_k__XHI-", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "http://www.techradar.com/au/rss/reviews", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechRadar - Technology Reviews", "title": "Google Pixel 2 XL", "title_full": "Google Pixel 2 XL", "published": "2017-10-04T21:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NteMC8rs4wqUK2CskbBesH-1200-80.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 57, "comments": 0, "shares": 57}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efdb5fe985db108770b870169821799b4606e683", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8ZZA8UqCf0XQMo2SxI.ZG32vBQgddSn3Ho_JvEoXpT4lZuYGYQ.KEvkg1v_k__XHI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cameron Faulkner", "published": "2017-10-04T21:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Pixel 2 XL", "text": "Price increased over 2016 model Specs don\u2019t move the needle No 3.5mm headphone port \nAfter an incredible year for smartphones, which so far has seen the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 , iPhone X , LG V30 , Essential Phone and many more boundary-pushing entries, Google is up to bat for the last big hit of 2017. \nAnd today it took a mighty swing by announcing the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL, both of which reshape and polish the already-impressive 2016 Pixel devices, but not without a little controversy. \nFocusing on the Pixel 2 XL, the company clearly put some effort into making something more than just a larger version of the Pixel 2, as it did last year. In fact, this plus-sized phone visually stands out next to its smaller kin to such a degree that it might as well be a whole new product line. \nIt\u2019s not just the outside of the phone that has us excited. The specs, including the Snapdragon 835 processor, improvements made to the camera and the intriguing Active Edge feature, look to put it up against (and in some regards, beat down) the toughest round of competition ever put forward by leading manufacturers. \nBut as always, it comes down to this question: is the phone worth the cost? \nWhen it launches worldwide later this year, the Pixel 2 XL will ship for the hiked-up price of US$849/AU$1,399 (about \u00a3630) for the base 64GB model, while the 256GB is priced at US$949/AU$1,549 \u2013 we\u2019re getting close to the ceiling in terms of prices set by the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone X. \nWe\u2019ve had some time with Google\u2019s latest at its big event, and leading into our full review, we\u2019ll be updating this post with new impressions as we use the device, fresh photo samples and comparisons and more, so stay tuned. Design, display and Active Edge \nEven if it was pure coincidence, the original Pixel XL certainly blended nicely into the crowd of iPhones, thanks to its generous bezels top and bottom. However, in the year following its debut, this style has quickly gone out the window in favor of the bezel-less look, with even Apple opting for a high screen-to-body ratio with the iPhone X. \nSo, rather than risk of getting left behind in the last big announcement of the year, it makes sense that the Google Pixel 2 XL would adopt a similar look. And what a refresh this is. Compared to the smaller 5-inch Google Pixel 2, the larger 6-inch version, which now costs a whopping $200 more, provides a decent amount of reason for the price madness. \nStarting with the bezels (or the lack thereof), Google\u2019s new phone mostly clears them from view to put the focus on the display \u2013 an improved P-OLED display that features a polarized display that can be viewed easily with sunglasses. \nNot surprisingly, the new device improves on the original's with the 2,880 x 1,440 resolution (QHD+), which makes it, once again, the better of Google\u2019s two 2017 options for virtual reality via the Google Daydream View headset. \nOn its face, the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s bezel layout makes for a similar look to the LG V30 and LG G6. Given that very company poured work into the latest Google phablet, this comes as little surprise, and thankfully, the Pixel 2 XL stands out easily so that you won\u2019t confuse the phones. \nTearing our eyes away from the display (admittedly, a hard thing to do), the rest of the phone has received some big updates that are worth mentioning. \nFirst, let\u2019s address the elephant in the room: neither the Pixel 2 or the Pixel 2 XL feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. These aren\u2019t the first Android phones to omit the legacy port, but given that it made a pointed jab at Apple for doing so last year, there\u2019s a bit of egg on Google\u2019s face right about now. \nHowever, it\u2019s less than you might think given that Android Oreo supports plenty of high-quality wireless audio codecs. This doesn\u2019t excuse the decision, but as opposed to citing \u201ccourage\u201d as its inspiration, Google appears to have accounted for the change by working to solve the greater issue of a bad wireless experience, which we're all for. Plus, it's tossing a 3.5mm to USB-C adaptor in the box. \nAdditionally, it has announced the Google Pixel Buds, which could be a good wireless solution if you happen to have $159 around. They're most interesting than your average headphones though, as they live-translate languages. \nMoving right along, the edges of the Pixel 2 XL are rounded off, offering a single, smooth texture instead of the divisive, multi-layered mix of chamfered and glossy metal used in 2016\u2019s model. As usual, the right side of the smartphone plays host to the volume rocker and power button, with each delivering an optimal amount of tactility when pressed. \nThis sounds like a silly thing to pass judgment on, but in past years the hardware buttons on Nexus phones haven\u2019t yielded the longest lifespan for remaining clicky. Thankfully, we haven\u2019t experienced any issues whatsoever in its Pixel lineup, and this new phone appears to be no exception, though it\u2019s an issue that usually takes months to manifest itself. \nMoreover, the Pixel 2 XL features a new button of sorts that's impervious to whittling away: its Active Edge feature, which lets you squeeze the phone\u2019s frame to issue a command. \nWant to boot into the camera app or pull up Google Assistant? Just give the phone a light or hard squeeze, the intensity of which you can determine yourself. \nYou might remember that this feature first popped up as Edge Sense in the HTC U11, and now it\u2019s been swallowed up in the Pixel 2 XL. While some may stick to using buttons and on-screen prompts, Active Edge is an important new feature that adds a fun, new element of navigation to stock Android, which has the reputation of being a bit stale to some who prefer custom launchers. \nFlipped over on its back, the same split, two-toned design of aluminum and glass carries forward into 2017\u2019s Pixel devices, and it\u2019s less divisive than before. My colleagues had some tough words for the original Pixel\u2019s look, calling it \u201cpeculiar\u201d and \u201cpremium, if slightly odd\u201d. I personally don\u2019t agree, though I can see where they\u2019re coming from. That being said, this melding of materials on the Pixel 2 XL is much more harmonious. \nThe fingerprint sensor now sits below the glass fold, with only the large rear-facing camera, flash and accompanying sensors sitting within the glass. The slight camera bump might be seen as a flaw to some, but we\u2019re in support of Google raising the camera sensor out a bit, as it prevents the horrors that are endured when the original Pixel\u2019s rear glass cracks. Performance \nEarly rumors pointed to the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL being the first phones to launch with a next-gen Snapdragon processor, but that didn\u2019t come to pass. Alas, both smartphones feature 2017\u2019s go-to flagship workhorse, the Snapdragon 835. \nPaired with 4GB of RAM, the Pixel 2 XL might not seem like it\u2019s gunning for prime position in the numbers race, but of course we\u2019ve yet to see what this phone is capable of in real-world testing. \nLast year\u2019s Pixel XL is equipped with the Snapdragon 821, and we\u2019re still pretty pleased with the performance eked from it, so given Google\u2019s recent work to build a name for itself in internal chipset development, our guess is that this phone has some unique performance tricks up its sleeve. \nOf course, this smartphone will already be ahead of the greater pack of Android flagships at launch thanks to it coming with Android Oreo out of the box. You can expect super-fast boot times, optimized background app usage and, perhaps, a few more interesting Pixel-exclusive features coming down the line as Oreo matures. \nThe Pixel 2 XL\u2019s camera and battery are well worth a discussion, though we won\u2019t know what each is truly capable of until we spend more time with the phone. \nStarting with the cameras, Google has gone the extra mile to make its already-stellar camera even better \u2013 it's a 12MP sensor with an aperture of f/1.8 to capture low-light shots better, whether it be in the haze of night or a dark concert hall. On its front, Google has stuck with an 8MP sensor. \nGoogle showed off its Google Lens and ARCore capabilities, both of which are coming to Pixel first. More to come on that later on, but definitely worth a lengthy discussion. \nMoving onto the battery, as surprisingly efficient as the Snapdragon 835 has proved itself to be in the past year, we always like to see more battery in our phones, not less (staring daggers at the Moto Z2 Force). The Pixel 2 XL has been boosted ever so slightly to 3,520mAh over 3,450mAh used in the original XL. \nAs a result, the 2 XL is very likely to be the popular choice among those who want to use Daydream for longer and, well, just do everything else for longer, too. We're asking around about official battery capacity. \nWe\u2019ll have to perform more testing to see if the pairing of its QHD+ display and larger battery will win out versus the Pixel 2\u2019s 1080p screen and smaller battery, or if we\u2019re looking at equal projected lifespans between the two \u2013 something that many have said about the first batch of Pixels. Early verdict \n2017 is a hellish year (in that it\u2019s the best ever) to decide on a new smartphone, and Google certainly hasn\u2019t made it any easier with the Pixel 2 XL. \nBut thanks to some smart reconfigurations on both the design and internals fronts, plus a few extra surprises, like Active Edge and its seemingly killer camera, this smartphone could be the one you\u2019ve been waiting for since, if you\u2019re like me, last year\u2019s Google Pixel. \nThis new device appears to have made improvements where it needed them most (performance and design), as well as in areas where it already had a comfortable lead (camera, software). \nDespite these welcome additions to the Pixel formula, the most unwelcome ingredient is its new price tag, which starts at $849. The divide between the smaller Pixel 2 is wider now: $200 instead of $120. \nIs the jump worth it to you?

For Integrated iOS and Android browser Easy-to-use Unlimited devices supported on some plans Against Poor speeds in some locations Limited desktop client Free plan limited to 1GB/month \nFinjanMobile's VitalSecurityVPN is a feature-packed mobile browser with a bundled VPN . \nThe service sounds appealing. You get more than 20 locations, a free plan gives you 500MB a month of data \u2013 1GB if you register \u2013 and the commercial plans support unlimited mobile devices for $3.33 (\u00a32.66) a month over a year, or $5 (\u00a34) a month to cover desktops as well. \nMobile users get the VitalSecurityVPN browser. Features include logon via a custom passcode or biometric authentication. Banners tell you whether pages are safe, suspect or dangerous. There's detailed information on trackers, and the browser can block any or all trackers and ads. \nThe mobile browser comes with a complete VPN which covers all other apps. Windows and Mac users can also install this, although they just get a VPN client \u2013 there's no browser. Want to try VitalSecurityVPN? Check out the website here \nNone of this is exactly revolutionary. Many of the browser features are available with other products, and the VPN isn't anything new: it's essentially Avira's Phantom VPN with a new mobile shell. \nThe most interesting element here is probably the provider. Finjan isn't just another internet startup: it's been around since 1996, developing and patenting some major technologies, including the behaviour-based security system which it licenced to Microsoft in 2005. This is a company which knows what it's doing, and that alone makes VitalSecurityVPN worth a closer look. Privacy \nVitalSecurityVPN only provides a very general logging policy: \"We do not keep any records or monitor your traffic and sites you visit.\" That's reassuring, but the best services give us a lot more detail. \nFinjan is based on Avira's Phantom VPN, which does provide some extra privacy-related information on its own site. This isn't guaranteed to apply to VitalSecurityVPN, but it's a starting point. \nAvira says that PhantomVPN doesn't log your real IP address (when you connect) or the virtual IP addresses you're allocated within a session, the websites you visit, or \"any information that can link you to any action, such as downloading a file, or visiting a particular website.\" \nPhantomVPN does log the amount of data you've used, whether you're a free or paid user, and \u2013 optionally \u2013\u2018diagnostic data\u2019, which typically means details like program crashes or connection errors. There's nothing surprising in that, and many VPNs record considerably more. \nFinjan's general privacy policy has some issues. Personal data might be used to \"provide offers... by third parties\", and the company \"may use advertising service providers to serve Finjan advertisements on other websites or resources that you visit or use\". This isn't ideal, but it's also very common, and has no effect on your privacy while connected to the service. Performance \nVitalSecurityVPN installed without any difficulty on our Android device. We launched it with a tap and it fired up a very simple tutorial covering the basics. \nEnabling the VPN is simple, and a couple of taps will connect you to the nearest location. Alternatively, you can choose from more than 20 locations across North America and Europe, along with Brazil, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia. \nThe app connected quickly during testing, and it began to update in real-time to show the amount of data we'd used. If you're hoping to use the very limited 500MB/1GB free plan, that's going to be a very important detail. \nThere are no significant low-level VPN settings. You can't set ports, change the protocol or do anything else even faintly advanced. That could be a plus for someone who only needs the basics, but experienced users might be frustrated by the lack of control. \nThe browser's VPN interface is straightforward. Tap to connect, an icon lights up to tell you when you're online or if the connection drops, and you're able to switch back at any time to check on data use or close the connection. \nVisit any URL and the browser accesses 60+ top databases of malicious, phishing and other dubious sites, then briefly displays its 'safe', 'suspect' or 'dangerous' verdict on a banner at the bottom of the screen. \nMost of the time you don't really notice this \u2013 it's just a green notification which disappears within a few seconds \u2013 but if it indicates a problem, tapping the banner displays a VirusTotal-type report which tells you which engines flagged the site. \nVitalSecurityVPN also highlights its anti-tracker feature, but this is turned off by default, and the app warns you that turning it on can \"slow down the browser\" and \"in rare cases can cause a website to fail to load.\" \nWe enabled tracker monitoring anyway and visited a few ad-packed sites. A figure at the bottom right of the screen told us how many trackers were on the current page, and tapping this gave us details on the type of trackers (analytics, advertising and so on) and enabled some or all of these to be blocked. \nCould this protect your privacy? Maybe, but there are plenty of other apps and extensions which do something similar, and the fact that it's turned off by default suggests even Finjan doesn't believe it's essential. \nWhat's more important here is performance, and our regular benchmarks tests* showed mixed results. UK to UK download speeds were a reasonable 25 to 30Mbps, but connecting to Europe saw speeds drop to a disappointing 10Mbps or less in many locations. UK to US performance was much better at 20 to 25Mbps, and if you're on a mobile device this may all be good enough, but the best commercial VPNs will deliver more. \nFortunately, there was more positive news with our final privacy tests. VitalSecurityVPN passed with ease, concealing our IP, replacing our regular DNS and successfully blocking any identity leaks, keeping us safe from snoopers. Final verdict \nVitalSecurityVPN is really just a new shell for Avira's Phantom VPN, and although it's not a bad service, it's hard to see why you would pay for it. The free mobile browser is more interesting, though, with some useful security features and a 4.5-star rating on the app stores \u2013 it\u2019s worth a look. The best VPN services of 2017 \n* Our testing included evaluating general performance (browsing, streaming video). We also used speedtest.net to measure latency, upload and download speeds, and then tested immediately again with the VPN turned off, to check for any difference (over several rounds of testing). We then compared these results to other VPN services we've reviewed. Of course, do note that VPN performance is difficult to measure as there are so many variables .

The Google Home Mini is a smaller cheaper version of Google Home. So instead of a pricey \u00a3129/$129, expect to pay around $49 in the US and \u00a349 in the UK for relase on October 19. We're expecting official pricing and release dates for other countries soon. \nNaturally, the Google Home Mini comes with Google Assistant, meaning you can enjoy asking it questions via simply starting with, \"Ok, Google.\" And with the power of Google search engine behind it and now a super low price to match, Alexa's time may be up. \nColor options include chalk (grey), charcoal (black) and coral (pink). At such a cheap price point, you may be tempted to get more than one, especially for family homes as a new Broadcast app allows you to talk to any Google Home device in the house. \nWe'll be updating this article with Google Home Mini pre-order deals from a range of retailers as and when they appear online. Well, after we've ordered our own. What are Google Home bases? \nThe bottom part of the original Google Home speaker can be swapped out for different 'bases' to replace the default grey one. They're not cheap though and the official ones are only available from the Google Store at the time of writing. \nFabric bases are the cheapest at $20/\u00a318 and come in Mango (orange), Marine (green) and Violet. Metal bases are $40/\u00a336 and come in Carbon (black), Copper and Snow (slightly grey). We might just have to splash out for that Violet one though. \nWe've seen some third-party sales and knock-offs, mainly leather-style ones, at Amazon and eBay , but nothing particularly tempting so far and the prices aren't that much cheaper either.

Google has assured us that this issue was limited to units provided at its latest event (where we sourced our review unit), however, we didn\u2019t experience this issue .)\nFor just $49 (\u00a349, AU$79), the affordable Google Home Mini does something that the best Bluetooth speakers can\u2019t even fathom: it comes equipped with Google Assistant, which is always at-the-ready to help you find answers, turn on the tunes, dim the lights, start a TV show and more by using nothing but your voice.\nIn this way, the Home Mini is exactly like the larger, more expensive Google Home and even the powerful Google Home Max . But that\u2019s where the comparisons stop. While the others make for very solid standalone speakers from a performance standpoint, the Home Mini can\u2019t hold its own as the sole sound maker in your house.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly an aspect of subjectivity in judging sound quality, but most would agree that what the Home Mini is capable of isn\u2019t a whole lot. The soundstage \u2013 despite being pitched as 360-degrees \u2013 falls rather flat. While skilled in pulling up the most obscure music you can think up from a fairly wide variety of streaming services, it has a difficult time doing them justice because of this speaker\u2019s diminutive profile.\nOn the flipside, if you already own a Google Home or have a speaker set up with a Chromecast Audio, the Home Mini will make your audio arrangement even sweeter with its expertise leaning on the highs in the sound profile. Vocals and the like chime through clearly, but come in at the expense of, well, everything else. This isn\u2019t a problem if you have other speakers picking up the slack, but by itself, the Home Mini just isn\u2019t mighty enough.\nIn spite of that fact however, it\u2019s impossible not to recommend this little device. Its Assistant smarts, large list of features and low price make it easy to take the plunge on the Home Mini.\nCheck out the latest Google Home tips and tricks \nThe microphone toggle switch Design The Google Home Mini looks as if Google turned the Home upside down, then smushed it down to size. As such, you\u2019ll find the fabric-texture on the top of this device with the matte plastic on the bottom half. Also, if you like to compare tech to food, this device looks like a macaron.\nThe palm-sized Home Mini gives off a look that its fabric mesh is just for looks, but it\u2019s actually conductive to your touch in a few areas. For example, tapping the top pauses and resumes play. Google had plans to allow for the Assistant to be summoned by tapping and holding on the middle, but has since permanently (via: 9to5Google ) disabled the feature due to privacy concerns. \nPlacing a finger on the left and right sides of the speaker lowers and raises the volumes, as you might expect. And lastly, whenever you navigate with your voice or touch, the Home Mini will illuminate four LEDs on its top to show that your action has been registered. \n\nFour lights appear on the Home Mini when it's listening and thinking Moving down to the lower half, the Home Mini features a micro USB port on its rear to provide power (this device is battery-free, like the Amazon Echo Dot) and a microphone switch that enables you to turn off active listening, making this a speaker that you\u2019ll have to tap to interact with.\nExposing its bottom, you can see a circular rubber mat to keep still on whichever surface that you place it on. Google provided TechRadar with a coral (peach-colored) model, but the Home Mini is also available in chalk (grey) or charcoal (black).\nImage 1 of 8 \nImage 2 of 8 \nImage 3 of 8 \nImage 4 of 8 \nImage 5 of 8 \nImage 6 of 8 \nImage 7 of 8 \nImage 8 of 8 \nPerformance The Google Home Mini is the most affordable Google Assistant-enabled speaker available and thankfully, its voice recognition doesn\u2019t suffer from the reduction in size and price. Whether shouting from across the room or speaking gently 10 feet away, the Home Mini yielded similarly great results.\nIn terms of what the Home Mini can take control of, the list goes on. You can place a call for free in the US (later this year in the UK), stream music through an assortment of music apps like Pandora, Spotify, YouTube Music, iHeartRadio and more. It can send a request to pull up a YouTube video over to your Chromecast to effortlessly begin viewing. The Home Mini is also a smart home hub in that it can also integrate with Internet of Things (IoT) devices from the likes of TP-Link, Philips Hue, Wemo and more. \nBut putting aside its smart capabilities for a moment, the Home Mini boasts an impressive set of features that are available right out of the box for those who can\u2019t be bothered with talking with your speaker or connecting it with extraneous services.\n\nConnecting is a breeze through the Google Home app and is quick to teach you a thing or two about the Home Mini, like how it works and resources that provide instant access to a wide variety of free audio content. If you want to solely use the Home Mini as a set of Bluetooth speakers, the Google Home app offers up pairing settings, though they are rather buried within the app.\nOnce your smartphone is set up with the Home Mini, it\u2019s simple to begin listening. Either give the speaker a shout for some tunes, being as specific or vague as you\u2019d like, or just hit the Cast button near the top to give your phone free reign to push its audio straight to the Home Mini.\nSpeaking of Cast, Google\u2019s latest speaker works best within a crowd of other Cast-enabled devices. In my studio apartment, I grouped together a Google Home, a Chromecast Audio -connected soundbar and the Google Home Mini to build a surround-sound setup. When in this grouping, the Home Mini stood out as the star of the highs, pushing the vocals through extra hard when the larger Home was more focused on the mids.\nBut, on its own, the Google Home Mini shouldn\u2019t be used as much more than a desk buddy. It\u2019s more than enough if you\u2019re simply using it to get a glimpse at your calendar, hear the latest news or phone a friend with its free voice calling (available now in US, coming later in the UK). But if you\u2019re looking for something that will faithfully reproduce your favorite music, this isn\u2019t the best solution out there. This mini speaker can get fairly loud, but there\u2019s no bass in the delivery.\n\nVerdict The Home Mini is similar to the Amazon Echo Dot in that it\u2019s Google\u2019s attempt at getting the Assistant into as many homes as possible. At that, the sheer amount of capabilities that the Google Home brings in addition to its chic, premium build and the low price make it an instant star.\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a cheap speaker, the Google Home Mini will do the trick for many. But, keep in mind that it\u2019s best viewed as a supplement to the Home family, not the foundation. This device\u2019s specialty, aside from being oh-so smart, is mainly to reward those who are already within Google\u2019s Cast-enabled walled garden with a cheap, new device.\nThe Google Home Mini might be less than half the price of the larger Google Home, and half its size, too, but it just doesn\u2019t sound like we\u2019re getting half its performance, we\u2019re getting something a bit worse.\nWhich Google Home is the best for you?

Plenty of leaks were confirmed, as expected, but Google remarkably managed to sneak a few surprises into the event as well. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of the most noteworthy products to cross the stage today. Prev Next The Google Pixel 2/Google Pixel 2 XL \nLet\u2019s start with the obvious. The Android Oreo-powered Google Pixel 2 and the Google PIxel 2 XL come with 5.5-inch and 6-inch displays respectively, and the XL comes with a nifty curved plastic OLED display that stretches almost to the phone\u2019s edges. Google claims the screen size is the only way the two phones differ in general user experience, which is great because that means owners of both phones can enjoy neat features such as squeezing the phone to take a selfie. Much as with the iPhone 8, the Pixel\u2019s 8-megapixel cameras support augmented reality, along with a \u201cPortrait\u201d mode that blurs the backgrounds of close-up shots. But, sorry headphone lovers, the jack is gone. Both phones are now available for preorder, with the Pixel 2 starting at $649/\u00a3629/AU$1,079 and the 128GB Pixel 2 XL starting at $849/\u00a3799/AU$1,399. Prev Next Google Pixelbook \nIt turns out the long-rumored Pixelbook was a Chromebook, after all. It\u2019s also a tablet if you want it to be, as the design allows you to switch effortlessly from tablet to laptop and to a tent display for interacting with the 12.3-inch touchscreen on a table. You\u2019ll get around 10 hours of battery life from the device, as well as access to Google Assistant. \nIf you talk to Google Assistant, it\u2019ll give a voice response, but if you type out a question, it\u2019ll give you a silent, written response so you\u2019re not bothering everyone around you. Optionally, you can also pick up a $99 (about \u00a375/AU$126) stylus that was created from a partnership with Wacom. \nPreorders open today for the device, which starts at $999/\u00a31,199 (about AU$1,270). You can also get a high-end version for $1,649/\u00a31,699 (about AU$2,097) with more RAM and an Intel i7 processor.

Well, the same can be said about the Google Home and the Google Home Mini, but the Max is the only one suited to rock the house thanks to its impressive hardware. \nBut of course, this is Google we're dealing with, so you'll also find a hearty dose of artificial intelligence smarts built into the Max. This, in a way, plays just as crucial a role in delivering your music in a crisp, room-filling manner. \nIt's tough to convey the worthiness of an audio product, especially one that claims to take things to the \"Max\" as this one does. But as someone who has reviewed many headphones and Bluetooth speakers, I can confidently say that there's something special here. \nWe didn't have a chance to test the Max outside of Google's controlled environment, but the demo that showed off what a single Max could do, as well two paired up, left us wanting more. Google Home Max price and release date \nThe Max debuts in December for $399 (around \u00a3300 / AU$510) and unfortunately for our friends outside of the US, it's not making its way outside of North America just yet. \nIt was a similar story when the original Google Home was first announced. Like the Max, the speaker was originally exclusive to North America, before making its way to other territories after around six months. \nAlthough a day-in-date release worldwide would be preferable, we hope that people in other territories won't have to wait long to see the Max released. Design \nThe Google Home Max piggy-backs on the look of the other Home models in that it keeps it super simple on the design front. Unlike the others, you'll know this is a speaker right away, but Google has worked in a bit of elegance here to make its hefty 11-pound build work in its favor. \nAcross the front is a mesh fabric that hides the drivers. On the Max's top, you'll see a small line that indicates the location of the speakers touch-friendly sensor that's used for adjusting volume controls and skipping throughout your favorite album, that is, unless you'd rather do it with your voice. \nThe speaker's rear plays host to a few features. There's an on/off switch right in the middle, but near the corner is where the included power supply plugs in. Next to it, there's a 3.5mm jack to output to your preferred device, as well as a USB-C port, which I'm told is used for piping in an ethernet connection. Google didn't state if it was including one in the box. \nOne of Max's more interesting features is that it doesn't feature permanent rubber feet. It can stand either horizontally or vertically without scuffing the table (or the Max itself) thanks to its magnetic rubber platform that can easily be taken off and relocated to shift its orientation. Performance \nEquipped with two custom 0.7-inch tweeters and two 4.5-inch dual-excursion woofers, the Max impresses right out of the gate. As we mentioned, the Max was demonstrated in a controlled environment, so we're really looking forward to testing this out in a bunch of different environments. \nNeedless to say, an 11 pound speaker is capable of so much more than the other Google Homes, but we were really impressed with just how loud the speaker got, all without showing any signs of reaching a threshold. \nTo that end, each and every slice of the music profile sounded crisp, clear and without compromise in the sound delivery \u2013 and this was just with an MP3. We'd love to try this out with a vinyl record. \nGoogle's Smart Sound technology utilizes artificial intelligence to dynamically shift the delivery of your tunes. This can be based on room size, obstacles in the room, time of day, and where the Max is located in the room. Much like the Apple HomePod, Google is really touting the smarts in this speaker as being just as central to the experience as the hardware is. Early verdict \nWith the Max, there's now a Google Home suited for all sorts of living quarters \u2013 from the bedroom, the kitchen and the garage. This one just so happens to be about rocking louder and being smarter than the others. \nComing in at $399, this isn't as easy to plunk down on as the other Home models \u2013 especially when stacked up against the $49 Google Home Mini \u2013 but doing so means treating yourself to deeper, louder and smarter experience. Here's everything you need to know about Google Home Mini What is a hands on review? \n'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours.

And, as can be expected from the flagship phones of the Android maker, they appear to be fantastic. \nHowever, just as Android has to compete with iOS, the Pixel 2 has to compete with the iPhone. Here, we\u2019re going to take a look at the biggest options from Apple and Google, the iPhone 8 Plus and Pixel 2 XL, and see how they stand up to each other. Design \nThe Pixel 2 XL upgrades the design of the original Pixel XL to a small degree. It trims its bezels to increase the screen-to-body ratio of the phone\u2019s front. It also squeezes two speakers above and below the screen for stereo audio. \nThe iPhone 8 Plus, on the other hand, keeps the same old bezels as the previous generation of iPhones. It does have a stereo speaker setup, but not quite like the Pixel 2 XL, as one speaker is firing out of the bottom of the iPhone. Sadly, neither phone includes a 3.5mm headphone jack. \nThere\u2019s one camera on each side of the Pixel 2 XL, and the rear includes what Google claims is the fastest fingerprint sensor on a smartphone. The iPhone 8 Plus has a dual-lens setup on the back and a selfie snapper on the front. It also has its Touch ID fingerprint scanner built into the Home button on the front. \nBoth phones have an IP67 rating against water and dust. So, they should have no problem with dust and splashes, and can be fully submerged for 30 minutes in about three feet of water. Both have strengthened screens, with the Pixel 2 XL using Gorilla Glass 5 and the iPhone 8 Plus using what Apple only described as its strongest smartphone glass yet. \nBoth phones have metal bodies, though the Pixel 2 XL has a glass upper portion on the back. Interestingly, the two phones are roughly the same size. The iPhone 8 Plus measures 158.4 x 78.1 x 7.5mm, and the Pixel 2 XL is 157.9 x 76.7 x 7.9mm. Google\u2019s device is a little lighter, coming in at 175g to the iPhone\u2019s 202g. \nThe iPhone 8 Plus offers a bit more in terms of color options, coming in Space Grey, Silver and Gold. Google\u2019s device has comparatively less glamorous options, with just Black & White and Just Black. \nWhich phone wins on design will more or less come down to personal taste. Display \nThe Google Pixel 2 XL should easily take home the prize for best screen in its matchup with the iPhone 8 Plus. It\u2019s not only larger, but also more pixel dense. \nThe Pixel 2 XL features a 6-inch pOLED display with a resolution of 2,880 x 1,440 and pixel density of 538ppi. That\u2019s super crisp, and has the unbeatable contrast ratio offered by OLED technology. \nThe iPhone 8 Plus can\u2019t compete with its 5.5-inch LCD display running at only 1,920 x 1,080. It\u2019s True Tone technology may help it display images with accurate color, but it won\u2019t look as nice as the larger, more pixel-dense OLED display on the Pixel 2 XL. Google tops it off with support for its virtual reality platform, Daydream. OS and power \nWhile there is a large degree of user preference involved here, Apple may win this category thanks to its sheer power. The iPhone 8 Plus runs iOS 11 on a hexa-core A11 Bionic chipset. It\u2019s believed to run on 3GB of RAM, and iOS is known for using RAM extremely efficiently. \nThe Pixel 2 XL runs Android 8.0 Oreo on an octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset with 4GB of RAM. While we\u2019ll have to wait and see how well the new Android operating system runs on the latest Snapdragon hardware, Apple\u2019s impressive A11 performance looks hard to beat. \nGoogle Assistant is central on the Pixel 2 XL, and can help users complete tasks in a hurry. But, Apple has Siri to keep the competition lively. Both digital assistants will need testing to see which is more helpful in their latest forms, but Google Assistant is likely to have to edge thanks to Google\u2019s efforts into AI and machine learning. Camera and Battery \nApple has always patted itself on the back for its incredible smartphone cameras, and it had every right to do so. Each iPhone has consistently offered one of the best smartphone cameras at the time of its launch. But, Google took it to another level by scoring the highest marks for a mobile phone camera from DxOMark with its first Pixel phones. The Pixel 2 XL scores even higher and sets a new record. \nThe iPhone 8 Plus has a dual-lens set in back, with a 12MP wide-angle camera at f/1.8 and a 12MP telephoto camera at f/2.8. It lacks optical image stabilization for both cameras. On the front, a 7MP f/2.2 snapper is ready to take crisp selfies. \nGoogle only put one camera on the back of the Pixel 2 XL, but it\u2019s a 12.2MP f/1.8 shooter with both optical and electronic image stabilization. Google\u2019s Dual Pixel technology and AI-powered image recognition also let it selectively blur backgrounds in a special portrait mode akin to what dual-lens cameras do. The front-facing 8MP f/2.4 camera can also use that portrait mode. Both phones are capable of augmented reality. \nThe two cameras will need to be tested against each other, but the record-setting DxOMark score seems to put the Pixel 2 XL above the iPhone 8 Plus. \nThe Pixel 2 XL also looks like it\u2019ll be winning the battery contest. It has a large 3,520mAh. It\u2019s uncertain how big the iPhone 8 Plus battery is, but rumors place it at about 2,691mAh, putting Google ahead by about 25%. Just how long those batteries last in each phone will come down to how efficient they are, but with smartphone screens being the biggest battery hog, the Pixel 2 XL is likely to come out ahead thanks to its efficient OLED screen. Price \nBoth phones have a base model that comes with 64GB of internal storage. The Pixel 2 XL starts at $849/AU$1,399, while the iPhone 8 Plus is $50/AU$170 cheaper at $799/AU$1,229. \nSince both phones are almost equally new, they\u2019ll both likely be awhile in getting great discounts or deals. The Google Pixel 2 XL does come with a free Google Home Mini for a limited time, which would actually put the two phones on an even price point if the Google Home Mini price were subtracted from the total. \nThe price of Google phone also comes with unlimited cloud storage for full-resolution photos and videos taken on the device, whereas Apple has limits to its cloud storage. Takeaway \nIt\u2019s not as simple a matter to compare an iPhone and an Android phone as it is to compare two Android phones. With such different operating systems and chipsets, it\u2019s impossible to say which device is going to offer a better user experience this early on. \nOn paper, the iPhone 8 Plus and Pixel 2 XL have a lot of close races. The screen and stereo speakers put the Pixel 2 XL a ways ahead for media consumption, but ample testing will be required to decide which really is the king of smartphone cameras. \nEven if the Google Pixel 2 XL comes ahead slightly in a lot of matchups, the iPhone 8 Plus is still $50/$AU170 cheaper. We\u2019ll continue to update as testing helps us determine which phone wins out in each category.

They\u2019re both rearing to be the best smartphones on the market, and we\u2019re all waiting for them to actually release. \nThe iPhone X doesn\u2019t release until early November, and the Pixel 2 XL was just announced. Since each is the pinnacle of what the makers of iOS and of Android can do with a phone, they embody the iOS-Android rivalry. So, now we need to see how they stand apart. Design \nWhile the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were effectively hardware refreshes of last year\u2019s iPhones, the iPhone X actually comes with an entirely new design. It adopts the reduced-bezel aesthetic that\u2019s becoming the mark of a modern flagship. It has a redesigned metal edge, and even more glass on the back. \nThe front of the iPhone X is nearly all screen save for a cutout at the top of the display that houses the earpiece, front-facing camera, and other sensors. The vertically oriented dual-lens camera is on the back of the iPhone X. Unlike past iPhones, there is no Home button on the iPhone X. Instead it uses facial recognition to unlock. \nIn comparison, the Pixel 2 XL has more bezel going on, looking a little less futuristic and a lot more metallic because of its aluminum unibody. It has stereo speakers positioned at the top and bottom of the display. There\u2019s no physical home button on the front of the Pixel 2 XL either, but it includes what Google claims is the fastest smartphone fingerprint scanner on the back. It has a single camera on each side. \nThe Pixel 2 XL is larger than the iPhone X in every dimension. The Pixel 2 XL measures 157.9 x 76.7 x 7.9mm and weighs in at 175g. The iPhone X is just 143.6 x 70.9 x 7.7mm and a single gram lighter than the Pixel 2 XL. \nBoth phones include similar levels of physical protection. Identical IP67 ratings for both indicate that they\u2019re not afraid of dust and can spend up to 30 minutes in about three feet of water without taking damage. The Pixel 2 XL has Gorilla Glass 5 to resist shattering from falls onto flat surfaces, and the iPhone X has what Apple says is its strongest smartphone glass so far. \nNeither phone has much in terms of color options. The iPhone X comes in Space Grey and Silver, while the Pixel 2 XL comes in Just Black or Black & White. The iPhone X and Pixel 2 XL share another commonality in their lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack. \nEven though the Pixel 2 XL improves on the design of its predecessor, the iPhone X has an edge thanks to its reduced bezels. Display \nThe competition for displays is a close one between the iPhone X and Pixel 2 XL. Google has packed a 6-inch pOLED display with a resolution of 2,880 x 1,440 into the Pixel 2 XL, giving it a pixel density of 538ppi. \nThe iPhone X display is slightly smaller, at 5.8 inches. It also has a lower resolution of 2,435 x 1,125. The pixel density is still great, at 458ppi, but it\u2019s not as sharp as the Pixel 2 XL. Apple does have an extra perk in its screens though, with 3D Touch allowing long presses. \nWhich display actually appears more pleasing to the eyes is a tougher matter to resolve. Both use OLED technology, but the iPhone X uses a standard AMOLED display and the Pixel 2 XL uses a pOLED one. The difference between these isn\u2019t likely to be noticeable, but Apple\u2019s True Tone technology could help it stand out. On the other hand, the Pixel 2 XL is better prepared for VR, and Google Daydream support is baked in. Be on the lookout for our full reviews, which will explore just how well each screen performs in the wild. OS and power \nPerhaps the most distinct and hardest to compare aspects of the Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X are the hardware inside and the software they run. \nEach is running on the latest software. The iPhone X runs iOS 11, which is now available for some earlier iPhone models as well. The Pixel 2 XL runs Android 8.0 Oreo. \nOdds are that the Pixel 2 XL will run smoothly and efficiently on Android Oreo, but until we can test that in full, it\u2019s impossible to say just how fast its octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset will feel and how efficiently the operating system will use its 4GB of RAM. \nPerformance of the iPhone X is a bit more clear. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are already out, and they run the same operating system and hexa-core A11 Bionic chipset that come in the iPhone X. The iPhone X is believed to have 3GB of RAM. The efficiency of iOS and the power of the A11 Bionic all but guarantee incredible performance on the iPhone X that will be hard for even top Android phones to beat. \nBoth phones have virtual assistants built in. The iPhone X comes with Siri, and the Pixel 2 XL has Google Assistant. Each continues to improve, but Google\u2019s strength in AI, search and machine learning may give it an edge over Siri that continues to grow as Google Assistant learns from more users. As a bonus, Google Assistant can be activated by squeezing the Pixel 2 XL. Camera and battery \nA killer flagship phone needs a killer camera. Google and Apple both know this. iPhones always come with an impressive camera that Android cameras try to beat. \nLast year, Google tried to show it was at the head of the pack by earning the highest DxOMark score for a smartphone with the camera in the Pixel and Pixel XL. The new Pixel 2 XL has a camera that scores even higher and once again sets the record for smartphone cameras. \nThe Pixel 2 XL packs a 12.2MP rear camera with optical and electronic image stabilization and an aperture of f/1.8. While it doesn\u2019t have a dual-lens system like much of its competition, it has Dual Pixel technology and image recognition, which enable a selective focus portrait mode like that dual-lens cameras offer. The front-facing 8MP f/2.4 camera also has this portrait mode. It\u2019s undoubtedly going to be an impressive smartphone camera, but testing will be necessary to see just how impressive. \nApple\u2019s iPhone X also has a 12MP rear-camera, but there\u2019s a second one paired with it. One has a wide-angle lens with an 1/1.8 aperture, and the other has a telephoto lens with an f/2.4 aperture. It also features optical image stabilization. Since it has a dual-lens system, it can accomplish the selective focus effects that the Pixel 2 XL has, but it remains to be seen which method is better. \nBoth phones support augmented reality, but so far only the iPhone X has Apple\u2019s impressive Animoji, which are special animated emoji that mirror the expression and movements of a user\u2019s face. \nThe battery competition isn\u2019t so close. The Pixel 2 XL packs a serious 3,520mAh battery that Google says can get up to seven hours of life in just 15 minutes of charging. \nThe numbers are not in Apple\u2019s favor here. While the size of the iPhone X battery hasn\u2019t been released, rumors pin it at about 2,716mAh, which doesn\u2019t even come close to the Pixel 2 XL. It does support wireless charging, unlike the Pixel 2 XL. Price \nThe price battle goes in Google\u2019s favor. The Pixel 2 XL is still expensive at $849 for the base 64GB model, but that\u2019s a far cry from the iPhone X\u2019s starting price of $999 for the 64GB model. The Pixel 2 XL even comes with a free Google Home Mini for a limited time. \nSince both phones are new, it\u2019s not likely that either is going to get a serious discount that would nudge one closer to a win in this category. Takeaway \nComparing the iPhone X and the Pixel 2 XL and naming a winner is just as hard as comparing iOS and Android. They\u2019re two different beasts, and each has ways of beating the other depending on what they\u2019re competing over. \nThe iPhone X is going to be the best iPhone experience available for the next year. And, the Pixel 2 XL may very well be the best Android experience for a while (if it can actually conquer the Note 8). \nFor anyone that\u2019s a fan of Android, the iPhone X probably doesn\u2019t have a compelling enough edge to switch over to iOS. Similarly, iOS fans are probably not going to feel like the Pixel 2 XL offers enough improvements over the iPhone X to warrant switching teams. \nWhen we get our hands on review units, we\u2019ll have a better idea of which phone is really the best, but there\u2019s no doubt both will be great.

Today, though, Apple released an update to watchOS 4 , called watchOS 4.0.1, to owners of the smartwatch, and it apparently solves the issue. \nAccording to the patch notes, \"watchOS 4.0.1 fixes issues that in rare cases were causing Apple Watch to join unauthenticated (captive) Wi-Fi networks, such as those found in public places like coffee shops and hotels, which direct the user to a webpage before the network can be accessed.\" If you don't have an Apple Watch 3 and were specifically holding out because of these concerns, this might be a good time to pick one up.

Finding a cheap Google Pixel 2 XL is next to impossible. Thankfully, we have some advice. \nIt costs $849 at full price for the 64GB configuration and goes all the way up to $949 for the 128GB variant, you can avoid paying for it all at once. Here's how. Switch over to Google Pixel 2 deals Google Pixel 2 XL deals on Verizon \nYou can now pre-order the Google Pixel 2 XL through Verizon, the only carrier that's offering the phone through its stores. It'll ship on November 19. \nThe best part about this is the fact that you don't have to pay for the phone in full right away. Verizon splits up the payments through a monthly device plan. \nIt costs $35.41 a month for the Pixel 2 XL over the course of $24 months. There is a $30 Verizon activation fee, but the US carrier waives the $35 restocking fee if you have any regrets within 14 days. \nThe more expensive 128GB version is split into 24 payments too, costing $39.58 a month instead of $949 all at once.

It works by dispensing a small amount of alcohol gel when it's pushed, disinfecting the surface. \nIt's built up of three separate non-woven textiles, the researchers say, creating tiny valves that pump out the alcohol gel. It wouldn't be suitable for every surface, as it needs replacing every seven days, but it could be useful for areas that are frequently touched. Hospitals \nThe team, who have formed a spin-off company to commercialise the technology, imagines that it could prove particularly useful in hospitals back on Earth. \nDoors in hospitals are touched by many people over the course of a day, and only one person with dirty hands can spread contamination to everyone else. But by covering a portion of the door with this material, it could be kept sterile. The team has also invented a door handle using the same technology. \nIn tests, the team found that Surfaceskins was more effective than a standard door plate, over a period of seven days, in reducing levels of three bacteria that cause common infections. \nMark Wilcox, a Professor of Medical Microbiology at the University who led the testing, said : \"Our results suggest that Surfaceskins door pads can help to reduce the contamination of doors by microbes.\" \n\"They offer a new way to reduce the risk of the spread of bacteria and viruses in hospital environments and other settings where frequent contact with doors could undermine hand hygiene.\" \nThe details of the tests were published in the Journal of Hospital Infection .

Could Microsoft kill off the Surface in 2019? Analyst claims Microsoft will soon stop producing Surface devices Shares \nMicrosoft will stop making Surface hardware when 2019 rolls around, at least according to the head of one analyst firm, and a big cheese exec at Lenovo. \nThis claim emerged at the Canalys Channels Forum, where the chief executive of analyst company Canalys, Steve Brazier, noted that Microsoft had a lot of cost-cutting to do when it came to balancing the books, and that the \u201cSurface will be the first target\u201d. \nAs the Register reports, Brazier noted that Microsoft\u2019s CEO Satya Nadella is a \u2018cloud and software guy\u2019, and that Microsoft\u2019s convertible notebooks would go the same way as its smartphones . \nBrazier observed: \u201cThe Surface performance is choppy; there are good quarters and bad quarters, overall they are not making money. It doesn\u2019t make sense for them to be in this business.\u201d \nHe further added that bean counters and the denizens of Wall Street will question why Nadella has forged a path into a low-margin business here. \nGianfranco Lanci, corporate president and COO at Lenovo, not only agreed with Brazier\u2019s assessment, but felt Microsoft could shutter the Surface business even earlier than the year after next. \nLanci commented on the alleged impending shutdown: \u201cIt might be earlier [than 2019]. Microsoft is making a lot of money on cloud, making a lot of money on Windows and Office, but losing a lot of money on devices. And frankly speaking, it is difficult to see why they should keep losing money.\u201d Looking beneath the Surface \nSo, what to make of this? Surface hybrids have always had their ups and downs \u2013 ever since Microsoft launched the first device back in 2012, which was hampered by its high price and operating system (Windows RT) \u2013 and the premium price tag is something which has never gone away. \nIn recent times, we\u2019ve seen a dip in Surface revenue, which was down 2% in Microsoft\u2019s last reported fiscal quarter, and dropped a far more worrying 26% year-on-year in the previous quarter. \nAlthough that contrasts markedly with last year when sales became stronger, and indeed Microsoft was claiming its \u2018 best sales to consumers ever \u2019 at the close of 2016. \nIt\u2019s a variable sales picture, that much is clear, although part of the reason for the drop certainly throughout the earlier part of this year might simply be the fact that a refresh had been due for so long (and it finally went on sale in June). \nBut even if Surface isn\u2019t making any money overall as Brazier claims, the line of hybrids isn\u2019t just about filling the coffers. Indeed breaking even could be just fine, because the Surface products can be viewed not as a financial investment, but rather an investment in reputation. \nThe idea has always been that Surface is there to show hardware partners what can be done with Windows devices, and to blaze a trail for the hybrid concept with Microsoft\u2019s OS. Something it has done very ably \u2013 just look at our review of the latest Surface Pro , which is a very slickly designed piece of kit. Admitting defeat? \nAlso consider that to do away with the Surface line would be an admission of defeat when it comes to Windows hardware, and that\u2019s certainly not a step Microsoft would want to take \u2013 a failure in the laptop arena, following a disaster with smartphone hardware in missing the mobile boat? \nMicrosoft also appears to be trying to follow the Apple model with its retail stores, and is expanding on this front, with plans just revealed to open the first UK bricks-and-mortar outlet in London (next door to Apple, in fact). And of course, Microsoft needs some hardware to showcase in these shops. \nSo you can talk about the cost of Surface hardware, but if the hybrids were canned, that\u2019s a lot of reputational fallout to be dealing with \u2013 an equally damaging cost which might not hurt the coffers, but will potentially put a big dent in the Microsoft brand. \nThese are all reasons why it seems a little unlikely to be talking about the demise of Surface devices as soon as the year after next, even if Microsoft\u2019s clear focus is on cloud and software, where the real money is generated. \nMaybe we\u2019re missing something in the big fiscal picture at Microsoft, which Brazier has his finger on the pulse of, but only time will tell. \nThe Surface Book being killed off in the near-ish future, on the other hand, is something that we can envision, given that this is a highly niche part of the hybrid range. And we seem to have waited forever for the Surface Book 2 \u2026 One of Microsoft\u2019s Surface devices is on our best laptops list Related news ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nadella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lanci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve brazier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gianfranco lanci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satya nadella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazier", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lenovo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canalys", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canalys channels forum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T12:09:17.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 1171, "moreResultsAvailable": 1071, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1507194557000&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Atechradar.com&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 707}
