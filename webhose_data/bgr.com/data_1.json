The new smartphones are probably going to be the stars of the press conference, although we already know everything there is to know about them. \nA couple of reports earlier this week showed press renders of the new devices and revealed more details about the Pixel 2 phones, including a disturbing detail about the Pixel 2 XL that we didn\u2019t see coming. For some reason, the phone will \u201csteal\u201d the most annoying thing about Apple\u2019s iPhone X. Don't Miss : Once again, Amazon is the only way you\u2019re getting a Super NES Classic right now \nNo, the Pixel 2 XL doesn\u2019t have a notch. That may be the worst design decision Apple ever made, but Google won\u2019t steal that one just yet. \nHowever, Google will inexplicably copy Apple\u2019s decision to delay the most exciting iPhone this year. The most annoying thing about the iPhone X is that you can\u2019t buy it yet. It\u2019ll arrive only on November 3rd, and it\u2019s expected to see tight supply in the months that follow. \nThe Pixel 2 is going to be released on October 19th, some two weeks after its official launch, we learned the other day. But the Pixel 2 XL will ship a month later, on November 15th. \nIt\u2019s unclear at this time what could cause potential Pixel 2 XL delays. As far as we know, there\u2019s no new technology inside the phone that should warrant such delays. The iPhone X\u2019s TrueDepth camera system that makes Face ID unlocks possible is so difficult to manufacture that it\u2019s holding iPhone X production back. \nAside from Pixel-branding and Google\u2019s new Oreo tricks, the LG-made Pixel 2 XL should be just a regular 2017 flagship Android phone. Just like the iPhone X, the Pixel 2 XL is going to be the best phone of the series, and it\u2019ll probably be a hit with buyers. \nWhat could force Google to postpone its launch? Reports earlier this year said that Google was looking to ink an OLED deal with LG to make sure it\u2019ll have enough screen supply for its smartphones. That said, we had no rumors about any potential Pixel 2 delays. iPhone X rumors, meanwhile, told us months ago that Apple could push the phone\u2019s launch back to November, in a worst-case scenario. \nOn the other hand, we\u2019ll remind you that, after so many years selling Nexus and Pixel devices, Google still hasn\u2019t figured out how to manufacture enough units to meet demand. Maybe that\u2019s why the Pixel 2 XL is delayed. Whatever the case, Google will hopefully share more details about it this week.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pixel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:46:10.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9c54aa6bc5ec66c33b09bdcaf1eb37857686d1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoRuTimvW9_C2T29UnRFZwwxtrayls_j_P5kwuJ5F2.rYC9hWx2eavGYo1psQmua6D5YyVoC1z0lQTuoTCc0zi1", "site_full": "bgr.com", "site": "bgr.com", "site_section": "http://bgr.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BGR", "title": "Dottie is a $20 Echo Dot accessory you\u2019ll wonder how you ever lived without", "title_full": "Dottie is a $20 Echo Dot accessory you\u2019ll wonder how you ever lived without", "published": "2017-10-03T15:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2702, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9c54aa6bc5ec66c33b09bdcaf1eb37857686d1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoRuTimvW9_C2T29UnRFZwwxtrayls_j_P5kwuJ5F2.rYC9hWx2eavGYo1psQmua6D5YyVoC1z0lQTuoTCc0zi1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maren Estrada", "published": "2017-10-03T15:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dottie is a $20 Echo Dot accessory you\u2019ll wonder how you ever lived without", "text": "Tweet \nI don\u2019t know about you, but I really hate cords.

Thankfully, the biggest space rocks have kept a good distance from our planet for quite some time. In just a few days, an asteroid of a much more petite variety is going to make an appearance near Earth, and it\u2019s coming so incredibly close that scientists are going to use it to conduct a mock emergency drill. \nThe rock, called 2012 TC4, is thought to be between 30 feet and 100 feet wide, and will make its closest approach on October 12th, 2017. That makes it a pretty tiny object, at least as far as asteroids are concerned, but its size isn\u2019t what researchers are most concerned with. TC4 is expected to come within 27,000 miles of Earth, which is just twelve percent \u2014 or roughly one-eighth \u2014 of the distance between our planet and the Moon. This is going to be a close one. Don't Miss : This best-selling sound bar is somehow only $90 on Amazon right now \nThe good news is that scientists are pretty comfortable with their current predictions of the rock\u2019s trajectory, having revised it from an earlier estimate that put TC4 within 5,000 miles of the Earth\u2019s surface. That said, the asteroid, which will be careening past our planet at a speed of over 30,000mph, is going to be a near-miss, and astronomers from around the globe are going to use it to simulate a real-life \u201csurprise asteroid\u201d scenario. \nThe International Asteroid Warning Network, which is made up of scientists at observatories from many different countries, will launch a planetary defense alert, summoning the combined power of observational hardware around the world to track and plot TC4\u2019s course in real-time as it cruises past. It will be the ultimate test of the cooperative network\u2019s ability to track a potential threat at a moment\u2019s notice. \n\u201cThis is the perfect target for such an exercise because while we know the orbit of 2012 TC4 well enough to be absolutely certain it will not impact Earth, we haven\u2019t established its exact path just yet,\u201d Paul Chodas of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory explains. \u201cIt will be incumbent upon the observatories to get a fix on the asteroid as it approaches, and work together to obtain follow-up observations that make more refined asteroid orbit determinations possible.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:16:26.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0092af8b1b6b99ff522318a203d500790370dc34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoRuTimvW9_C2T29UnRFZwwByNQOVDAsUbmuvgnsP2pC.sSWt61rMpN0.ltklEpCgWii7AiYYVgr5IQIaM5WtgLQpPf2mdu6IA-", "site_full": "bgr.com", "site": "bgr.com", "site_section": "http://bgr.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BGR", "title": "Generation 3 Pokemon might make their debut in \u2018Pokemon Go\u2019 on Halloween", "title_full": "Generation 3 Pokemon might make their debut in \u2018Pokemon Go\u2019 on Halloween", "published": "2017-10-03T19:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2702, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0092af8b1b6b99ff522318a203d500790370dc34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoRuTimvW9_C2T29UnRFZwwByNQOVDAsUbmuvgnsP2pC.sSWt61rMpN0.ltklEpCgWii7AiYYVgr5IQIaM5WtgLQpPf2mdu6IA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jacob Siegal", "published": "2017-10-03T19:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Generation 3 Pokemon might make their debut in \u2018Pokemon Go\u2019 on Halloween", "text": "Raid battles and Legendary Pokemon have kept Pokemon Go players occupied for the past few months, but as we hit the home stretch of 2017, we're holding out hope that developer Niantic has at least one more big surprise in store for us.

During the Nindie Summer Showcase back in August, Nintendo showed off a range of upcoming indie titles, including Super Meat Boy Forever , Shovel Knight: King of Cards and No More Heroes: Travis Strikes Again .

Looking like a little mechanical astronaut, it\u2019s capable of some pretty impressive movement, but it\u2019s not exactly something you\u2019d want searching for you in a disaster scenario. For that, you\u2019d be much better of with Honda R&D\u2019s new disaster response bot, which it just showcased for the first time after years of development. \nThe robot, named E2-DR, was first conceptualized in an R&D paper published by Honda back in 2015. It\u2019s an incredibly capable robot that is designed as a stand-in for rescuers in situations where sending humans in is a no-go, such as a nuclear meltdown like the still-recent Fukushima disaster. \nWeighing in at nearly 190-pounds and standing just over five feet, five inches tall, E2-DR can adapt to scale many different types of terrain and obstacles. It can walk (obviously,) crawl, climb ladders, navigate steps and traverse uneven platforms and even stand perfectly upright, rotating its feet to either side to slip through tight gaps. \nThe bot\u2019s head is absolutely packed with sensors, including infrared projectors and a trio of cameras with LED lighting. All that hardware is powered by an onboard Intel Core-i7, discrete GPU and custom cooling system. \nAt the moment, the robot isn\u2019t quite ready to send into the field, as Honda still has lots of things it wants to add, test and experiment with. The next phase of development will involve teaching the robot how to handle certain environmental threats, such as impacts and collisions.

But Google is actively pursuing various projects that will make it more like Apple when it comes to the way it runs certain divisions and releases certain projects. \nThe news comes directly from Sudar Pichai, who revealed as much in an interview without mentioning the name of its biggest rival in tech once. \nSpeaking to Nikkei , Pichai addressed various Google matters, including user privacy, anti-trust allegations, focus on hardware, immigration, and China. \nTalking about user privacy, Pichai admitted that Google has to do more to protect the user data. \n\u201cThe data belongs to the user. We are stewards of it,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cWe always live in a construct that users come and use us because they trust us.\u201d He suggested that Google will further improve privacy protection measures by utilizing cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology, saying that \u201cwe never feel we are done.\u201d \nGoogle was often criticized for the way it collects and handles user data, drawing intense scrutiny from authorities for certain practices in the past. \nComparatively, Apple has made user privacy a feature of its products.

If you recall, Waymo earlier this year sued Uber alleging that former Waymo engineer and recent Uber hire Anthony Levandowski absconded with hundreds of gigabytes of proprietary information surrounding Waymo\u2019s self-driving efforts. \nUber ultimately fired Levandowski this past May after refusing to cooperate with an internal Uber investigation into his hiring. That notwithstanding, Alphabet\u2019s lawsuit against Uber is still ongoing. Don't Miss : This best-selling sound bar is somehow only $90 on Amazon right now \nWith the two companies battling it out in court, we\u2019re starting to see a steady influx of intriguing court filings which house some entertaining text exchanges between Levandowski and former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. As we highlighted this past August, one such exchange involved Levandowski throwing some shade at Tesla CEO Elon Musk. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to start calling Elon on his s***,\u201d Levandowski said in a text many months ago. \u201cI\u2019m not on social media but let\u2019s start \u2018#faketesla\u2019 and start give [sic] physics lessons about stupid s*** Elon says.\u201d \nMore recently, a new court filing from Waymo provides us with even more information surrounding Levandowski\u2019s eventual employment with Uber. The court filing in question involves a due diligence report commissioned by Uber and includes a myriad of facts that Uber had unsuccessfully sought to keep out of the public eye. \nBusiness Insider summarized some of the more interesting details thusly: Levandowski once pitched Google employees on Otto\u2019s business during a ski trip to Lake Tahoe. Google self-driving car materials, including whiteboard sketches and pictures of equipment, were found on Levandowski\u2019s iPhone. The cybersecurity firm even physically went to a data destroyal company \u2014\u201cShred Works\u201d\u2014 to verify whether Levandowski had five disks shredded as he had said. Nobody at the company recognized Levandowski but they found a potentially relevant receipt. \nA particularly damning portion of the report reads in part: \u201c\u201dIt is difficult to believe that Levandowski was not, prior to his interview, fully aware of the extent of the data that he had retained.\u201d \nAnother segment relays that Lvandowski accessed Google data after leaving the company: \u201cA review of the names of the deleted files indicates that they were source code and electronic design files relating to driverless cars,\u201d the report indicates. \nThe full filing can be viewed below.

In fact, they\u2019re even saving human lives in entirely new ways, and surgeons from the Maastricht University Medical Center in The Netherlands completed the first robot-assisted supermicrosurgery. \nThe robot was used to suture vessels measuring as small as 0.3 millimeters across in order to treat lymphedema in a patient. It\u2019s such an incredibly delicate procedure that very few surgeons on the planet will even attempt, and this is the first time robotic assistance was used for such an operation.

It is controlled by a surgeon who, by moving their own hands, prompts tiny, precise movements of the robot\u2019s own small claws. As it translates the surgeon\u2019s movements into commands for the robot, the system can mitigate any shakiness or unsteady motion, leading to a cleaner and more perfect operation. \n\u201cWe are very pleased and proud that the first intervention using our robot has been a success, and that the surgeons are enthusiastic,\u201d Microsure\u2019s Raimondo Cau says. \u201cThis proves that our technology is a key breakthrough in improving surgical care.

Just a few weeks ago, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla is tentatively planning to hold an official unveiling event for the vehicle on October 26. \nBut why wait three more weeks when you can check out Tesla\u2019s latest EV right now? Earlier today, a photo purporting to show a Tesla semi-truck in transit mysteriously appeared on Reddit. While it remains unclear if the photo is authentic, it\u2019s worth noting that the sleek sloping design of the truck bears a strong resemblance to the teaser photo Tesla originally sent out a few months ago. Don't Miss : This best-selling sound bar is somehow only $90 on Amazon right now \nThe Tesla spy shot can be seen below. \nWhile nothing is official just yet, Elon Musk over the past few weeks has been characteristically effusive when talking about the company\u2019s semi-truck, noting a few months ago that it drives \u201clike a sports car.\u201d \nMore recently, Musk said that Tesla\u2019s semi-truck is next-level and that the entire unveiling event is going to be \u201cunreal.\u201d Notably, Tesla\u2019s interest in developing a semi-truck was officially laid out in the second installment of Musk\u2019s widely circulated master plan. Therein, Musk said that a Tesla semi-truck \u201cwill deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate.\u201d \nAll that said, Tesla\u2019s forthcoming semi-truck may prove to be a huge money maker for Musk and co. To this point, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas anticipates that Tesla\u2019s semi-truck could help the company rake in billions in additional revenue. \nIn a research note issued to investors earlier this year, Jonas said a semi-truck has the potential to easily add $2.5 billion in revenue annually to the company\u2019s bottom line. Interestingly, Jonas added that Tesla would only need to sell 25,000 trucks a year in order to match the revenue from selling 70,000 Model 3 vehicles. More bullish projections have Tesla raking in upwards of $7.5 billion from its semi-truck business. \nOf course, there\u2019s a very logical reason as to why companies would be interested in a Tesla semi-truck in the first place. Running solely on electricity, some speculate that operating a fully electric semi-truck from Tesla could be as much as 70% cheaper than a standard semi-truck due to lower maintenance costs and more. \nOf course, a looming question Tesla can\u2019t seem to shake centers on how long it will take the company to boost its production capacity to such a level that it can sufficiently handle demand for the Model 3, Model S, Model X and its forthcoming semi-truck. Though the company maintains it will produce 500,000 cars in 2018 alone, that\u2019s a lofty goal to say the least. \nWhile we\u2019ll have to wait until Tesla\u2019s rumored October event to learn more details, there is speculation that Tesla is aiming to launch the vehicle in 2020.

The EU ordered Amazon to pay 250 Euros million to the country, stating that Amazon has received unfair and illegal tax benefits in Luxembourg for more than a decade. The sum isn't quite as massive as Apple's back tax bill, but Amazon becomes the latest large US company to be dinged for dodgy tax practices abroad. \"Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three-quarters of Amazon's profits were not taxed,\" EU antitrust head Margrethe Vestager said in a statement . \"In other words, Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national tax rules. This is illegal under EU State aid rules. Member States cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others.\" \nVestager is the chief of the EU's Commission for Competition, which aims to ensure a level playing field among businesses with operations in the European Union. Vestager took the reins in 2014 and has turned up the heat on US tech companies. \nAmazon said in a statement that the company will consider filing an appeal to the ruling. More From BGR Report: Google building smart screen device to combat Amazon's Echo Show \nThe Seattle, Washington-based company has a staff of roughly 1,500 people in Luxembourg, making it one of the small country's largest employers. According to a statement made by the Competition Commission alongside its order, Luxembourg permitted Amazon to funnel more than half of its profits each quarter to a holding company that was not taxed. The practice, though not uncommon in many regions, is clearly frowned upon by the Commission. \n\"We believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that we paid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law,\" Amazon said in a statement. \nThe Commission clearly disagrees. The following is an excerpt from its statement. \nFollowing an in-depth investigation launched in October 2014, the Commission has concluded that a tax ruling issued by Luxembourg in 2003, and prolonged in 2011, lowered the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg without any valid justification. \nThe tax ruling enabled Amazon to shift the vast majority of its profits from an Amazon group company that is subject to tax in Luxembourg (Amazon EU) to a company which is not subject to tax (Amazon Europe Holding Technologies). In particular, the tax ruling endorsed the payment of a royalty from Amazon EU to Amazon Europe Holding Technologies, which significantly reduced Amazon EU's taxable profits. \nThe Commission's investigation showed that the level of the royalty payments, endorsed by the tax ruling, was inflated and did not reflect economic reality. On this basis, the Commission concluded that the tax ruling granted a selective economic advantage to Amazon by allowing the group to pay less tax than other companies subject to the same national tax rules. In fact, the ruling enabled Amazon to avoid taxation on three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the EU. \nThe European Commission for Competition's full release can be found here .

That's not too shabby for an iOS update that went live just two weeks ago, especially when you consider that iOS 11 isn't exactly a groundbreaking or must-have update. While iOS users haven't adopted iOS 11 as quickly as they took to iOS 10, the overarching takeaway is that iPhone users are far more likely to be running the latest version of iOS than Android users are likely to be running the latest version of Android. Bringing this up may seem like a quick and easy way to poke fun at Android, but the benefits or running the most up to date version of a mobile OS -- no matter the platform -- can't be overstated. New features notwithstanding, running an antiquated mobile OS typically leaves users more prone to serious security threats.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nNetflix is releasing 29 new originals this month starting today \u2013 here\u2019s the full list This best-selling sound bar is somehow only $90 on Amazon right now An asteroid is about to squeak by Earth at an incredibly short distance ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mixpanel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:16:35.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ce2bf1ca4dc80cee4bcf8e6b6b2332a7137e138", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoRuTimvW9_C2T29UnRFZwwQTmq3iVllcmTo8.teeFGDnhox3VpS9rqv9R0Ezzj9CQ-", "site_full": "bgr.com", "site": "bgr.com", "site_section": "http://bgr.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BGR", "title": "Today\u2019s best deals: Dyson vacuum, Philips Hue bundle, iPad Air, NES Classic controller, Fire 7, more", "title_full": "Today\u2019s best deals: Dyson vacuum, Philips Hue bundle, iPad Air, NES Classic controller, Fire 7, more", "published": "2017-10-04T16:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2702, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ce2bf1ca4dc80cee4bcf8e6b6b2332a7137e138", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoRuTimvW9_C2T29UnRFZwwQTmq3iVllcmTo8.teeFGDnhox3VpS9rqv9R0Ezzj9CQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maren Estrada", "published": "2017-10-04T16:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Today\u2019s best deals: Dyson vacuum, Philips Hue bundle, iPad Air, NES Classic controller, Fire 7, more", "text": "Tweet \nWe\u2019ve got a fantastic roundup of Wednesday\u2019s best daily deals for you, and it all begins with an exclusive $20 discount on the All-New Fire 7 Essentials Bundle when you use the promo code BGRFIRE7 at checkout.

Google will finally take the stage on Wednesday and make its new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones official. While it\u2019s true that most of the details surrounding Google\u2019s second-generation Pixel phone lineup have already leaked, the full picture is never clear until a company reveals its finished products on stage. And yet one analyst is already calling Google\u2019s new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL a flop, despite the fact that the phones don\u2019t even exist yet. Don't Miss : This best-selling sound bar is somehow only $90 on Amazon right now \nYou know you\u2019ve got something special on your hands when the author of an article quotes himself. Such is the case with Atherton Research analyst Jean Baptiste Su\u2019s contribution to Forbes on Wednesday morning. From start to finish, the article is a train wreck that makes bold assertions without offering any data or even logic to back them up. \nSu calls the unannounced Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL \u201cdull\u201d smartphones that are a \u201cmajor disappointment.\u201d What\u2019s so dull and disappointing about them? Let\u2019s find out. \nOn the Pixel 2, Su writes: \nGoogle\u2019s entry-level Pixel 2 is made by fledgling Taiwanese company HTC and shares the same boring design aesthetic than last year\u2019s model with a 5\u2033 display, large top and bottom bezels and a single rear camera. However, it does add a faster processor, water resistance, and 2 front speakers. Price starts at $649 for 64GB of storage, only $50 less than the equally boring iPhone 8. \nAnd on the Pixel 2 XL: \nFor its flagship device, Google hired LG to build the Pixel 2 XL, a pale copy of the South Korean phone maker own flagship device, the V30, unveiled over a month ago at the IFA tradeshow. The Pixel 2 XL has the same 6\u2033 almost edge-less OLED display than the V30, the same 835 processor from Qualcomm, water resistance, 2 front speakers, just one rear camera again, instead of LG\u2019s dual camera and no MicroSD card slot to expand the device\u2019s memory storage. The price of Google\u2019s new flagship device is $80 more than the original Pixel XL starting at $849 for 64GB of storage, about $50 more than the much more able LG V30 and $150 less than the iPhone X. \n\u201cSo far, the main advantage Google really had over its rivals was that its smartphones were using stock Android, that is, the operating system as Google builds it and unaltered of any additional graphical layer or third-party software on top of it, which allowed Google to be the first to update its devices with the latest version of Android and security patches,\u201d Su quoted himself as having said (\uf926\u200d\u2642\ufe0f). \u201cBut today others are also adopting Google\u2019s pure Android strategy like Essential, Lenovo or Nokia and are sometimes even quicker than Google to update their device.\u201d \nThe article is peppered with plenty of nonsense, the first example of which occurs as early as the second sentence, where the author states that HTC, founded 20 years ago and once ranked among the world\u2019s top smartphone makers, is a \u201cfledgling Taiwanese company.\u201d Things get so crazy that at one point, Su suggests that Google\u2019s Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL may even face serious competition from Essential, a barely-existent smartphone startup that has sold an estimated 5,000 handsets so far . \nIn the end, the author\u2019s conclusion is likely accurate. Sales of Google\u2019s second-generation Pixel phones won\u2019t even approach sales of leading devices like Apple\u2019s iPhones or Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S devices. We\u2019re not sure anyone on planet Earth ever thought Google\u2019s phones would sell in numbers that approach the top companies in the industry, but Su is still correct. And because sales of Google\u2019s new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL won\u2019t climb into 8-digit territory overnight, Su recommends that you \u201chold off on buying the Pixel 2.\u201d K .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pixel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T17:02:49.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51786608d64dec46e0d7e6bd16f9017d8d5d9340", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoRuTimvW9_C2T29UnRFZwwhJFJy16hKj9sWITglKorcmwxN.aiGwFDqE9UayOPqbMKGtc1gY6D7oiEBrYzARvmb6BFxoit0YA-", "site_full": "bgr.com", "site": "bgr.com", "site_section": "http://bgr.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BGR", "title": "National Taco Day 2017: Where to find free and cheap tacos today", "title_full": "National Taco Day 2017: Where to find free and cheap tacos today", "published": "2017-10-04T17:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2702, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "51786608d64dec46e0d7e6bd16f9017d8d5d9340", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoRuTimvW9_C2T29UnRFZwwhJFJy16hKj9sWITglKorcmwxN.aiGwFDqE9UayOPqbMKGtc1gY6D7oiEBrYzARvmb6BFxoit0YA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jacob Siegal", "published": "2017-10-04T17:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "National Taco Day 2017: Where to find free and cheap tacos today", "text": "Although not all of the national days celebrating random foods, drinks or professions pique my interest, National Taco Day is one of the few that absolutely can't be missed.

The Sonos One is a $199 smart version of Sonos\u2019s existing Play:1 speaker, but it will allow you to add voice control to your entire Sonos setup, if you already have one. \nIt integrates Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant, and Sonos is launching a new Sonos Alexa skill so that you can control your entire Sonos setup with voice commands. Of course, since it\u2019s got the full Alexa assistant baked in, the Sonos One will also work like any other Amazon Echo, with the ability to check weather, send messages, control smart home products, or buy stuff off Amazon. Don't Miss : This best-selling sound bar is somehow only $90 on Amazon right now \nThe hardware looks like it\u2019s based heavily on the existing Play:1 speaker, which is a good kitchen or living room unit. Of course, Sonos is hoping you\u2019ll pair the One with a more extensive Sonos system for whole-home audio. \nThe One differs from the Play:1 with a six-microphone array built in, which should mean accurate voice recognition. Sonos is also playing to the privacy crowd: there\u2019s an LED on the One hard-wired into the microphones, so if the mics are listening, the LED is on. \nThe Sonos One will go on sale October 24th for $199, a competitive price against the $149 Amazon Echo Plus, or the $349 HomePod (which is yet to be released). Sonos has long targeted people who are willing to pay thousands of dollars for a whole-home audio setup, but with the Sonos One launching at a low price, Sonos might think it\u2019s time to take its reputation for good design and clear sound to the masses.

It didn\u2019t come as much of a surprise since there were so many leaks ahead of Wednesday\u2019s event, but Google has made its hot new smartphones official. The Pixel 2 is a modest update to last year\u2019s smaller Pixel, though it does include a nice specs bump along with a few intriguing new features. But the big news is the new Pixel 2 XL, which features a bold redesign and a nice big 6-inch display complete with smaller bezels around the screen. \nIf you want a pure Android experience, Google\u2019s new smartphones are as good as it gets. And of the two new phones Google unveiled on Wednesday, the Pixel 2 XL is clearly the more appealing choice. It\u2019s also quite expensive though, so you\u2019ll definitely want to ensure that your sleek new Google phone is protected from the moment you get it. \nThat\u2019s where Caseology comes in. \nGoogle\u2019s new Pixel 2 XL phablet won\u2019t be released until next month, but the company already has several sleek new cases ready and waiting.

Apple\u2019s iPhone lineup was thoroughly spoiled long before it took the stage to unveil the iPhone X last month, and now Google has suffered the same fate with the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. But nevertheless, these companies have to press on, which is exactly what Google did on Wednesday morning in San Francisco, California when it officially uncovered the Pixel 2 XL. \nThe biggest change from last year\u2019s Pixel phones is the fact that the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL were built by two different manufacturers. Google stuck with HTC for the Pixel 2, but brought on LG to build the Pixel 2 XL. As a result, the two phones diverge rather noticeably in terms of their design \u2014 much more so than in 2016. Don't Miss : This best-selling sound bar is somehow only $90 on Amazon right now \nWhile the Pixel 2 looks nearly identical to last year\u2019s Pixel, the display of the Pixel 2 XL has rounded corners and stretches much closer to the edges of the phone. It\u2019s not quite as bezel-less as the iPhone X or the Note 8, but it\u2019s a noticeable improvement over the designs of the Pixel 2 and last year\u2019s Pixel phones. \nOther than the Pixel 2 XL\u2019s 6-inch QHD+ display (a significant leap over the Pixel XL\u2019s 5.5-inch screen), its specs fall in line with those of the Pixel 2. Both phones are equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and 4GB of RAM, and Google will offer a 64GB and 128GB model of each. Plus, they\u2019ll both run pure Android 8.0 Oreo. \nThe Pixel 2 line also has several new features, including an always-on display and the ability to squeeze the phone to activate Google Assistant. Google is also bringing customizable routines to the Pixel with Assistant. \nPreorders go live for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL today. The 64GB Pixel 2 XL will cost $849, while the 128GB Pixel 2 XL will retail for $949. Unlike the Pixel 2, the Pixel 2 XL comes in two colors: Just Black and Black and White.

Find Free WordPress Themes and plugins. \nGoogle on Wednesday finally unveiled the new smartphones Android fans across the country and around the world have been waiting for. The new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL represent the best of what Android phones have to offer\u2026 as long as you don\u2019t mind great big bezels around your display. Both new Pixel phones have plenty to offer, of course, but their designs are decidedly dated as top companies like Apple and Samsung move toward designs with almost no bezel at all around the screens. Of course, plenty of Android fans out there would gladly trade the narrow bezels on a phone like the Galaxy Note 8 for instant access to new Android updates, and now they\u2019ll be able to thanks to Google\u2019s new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. \nWe\u2019ve already told you just about everything there is to know about Google\u2019s new phones, but now it\u2019s time to focus solely on the best they have to offer. So in this post, we\u2019ll take a look at the hottest new features Google announced during Wednesday\u2019s big Pixel 2 event. Pure Android \nFirst and foremost, the fact that these are pure Android smartphones is undoubtedly the most appealing thing about them for many users. Why? Because Google\u2019s future Android updates will be available immediately to both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. Meanwhile, people with smartphones from other Android vendors will have to wait months or even years to get the latest Android builds. It\u2019s a huge pain point for most Android users around the world, but not for anyone with a Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL. Related How to Join Netflix\u2019s Test Program and Try Out New Features Early Feature Parity \nUnlike another smartphone maker we all know, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL have the same features instead of reserving some key features only for the larger version of the phone. New Design \nThe Pixel 2 XL is a bit newer than the smaller Pixel 2, but both phones have sleek unibody aluminum construction that\u2019s coated so you don\u2019t have to see those ugly antenna lines. The Pixel 2 XL in particular looks terrific, with a display that takes up a bit more of the phone\u2019s body than on the smaller Pixel 2. Always-On Display \nLike comparable flagship smartphones, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL feature an Always-On Display feature that shows the time, notifications, and other important info. Now Playing \nThe Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL can listen for music at all times in the background. Anytime a song is playing, the phone will identify it (without sending any info to Google) and display artist and track info on the screen. Then the user can quickly and easily play it in Google Music or watch the video on YouTube. Active Edge \nJust squeeze the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL and it\u2019ll launch Google Assistant. You can also use the feature for other things, like squeezing to take a selfie. Related Google Pixel 2 doesn't need a SIM card, as long as you use Project Fi Google Lens \nThis is Google\u2019s answer to similar smart camera features introduced by companies like Samsung. Point your camera at text, numbers, or landmarks, and Google Lens will act accordingly. For example, point your Pixel 2 camera at a movie poster and Google Lens will pull up info about the film. \nPixel users will get a preview of Google Lens, and then the feature will roll out to other phones (if and when they\u2019re updated to Android Oreo. Camera \nThe original Pixel and Pixel XL had one of the best smartphone cameras in the world when it debuted last year, and Google made it even better in the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. \nAccording to Google, the camera has improved in every way, with better low-light performance and sharper imaging in general. The camera also uses machine learning to create a Portrait Mode effect like Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 Plus, but with only one lens. Of note, the Portrait Mode feature works on both the rear camera and the front-facing camera. Also added to the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL is Motion Photo support, which is Google\u2019s rebranding of the iPhone\u2019s Live Photos feature. \nGoogle says the new Pixel 2 camera got a score of 98 from DxOMark, though it\u2019s unclear if Google is among the companies that pay DxOMark a consulting fee to help develop and tune their smartphone cameras.

The company\u2019s machine learnings and artificial intelligence know-how makes Google Assistant one of the best virtual assistant solutions currently available.

Sadly, following a stream of leaks, there weren\u2019t many surprises left unspoiled, but fans of Google devices still had plenty to get excited about, from new phones to new smart speakers to a new hands-free camera. Don't Miss : This best-selling sound bar is somehow only $90 on Amazon right now \nGoogle started by discussing its renewed focus on machine learning and AI. Google wants to solve problems, like how to map a neighborhood where the house numbers are difficult to detect, or how to find parking in San Francisco. There are 55 million Chromecasts floating around and more than 100 million unique answers were added to Google Assistant. And despite supply constraints, Google is happy with Pixel sales. But now it\u2019s time for new devices. Google Home Mini \nFirst up was the Google Home Mini, a new, smaller smart speaker in the Google Home line. The Mini features a durable, transparent fabric enclosure that lets through light and sound, with four LED lights visible through the fabric. Tap the fabric to pause your music, adjust the volume or talk to your assistant. It might be smaller than other smart speakers, but it still projects 360-degree sound and can hear you even when the music is blasting with its far-field microphones. The Google Home Mini will be available in Coral, Chalk and Charcoal color options and will cost $49 in the US. It\u2019s available for preorder today and will hit stores on October 19th. Google Home Max \nAnother addition to the Google Home line, Google debuted the Max on Wednesday as well. The Google Home Max feature dual high-excursion woofers, custom 0.7-inch tweeters and an acoustic brace. With Smart Sound, Google Home Max will adapt sound dynamically to its surroundings, so it will sound the best it can no matter where you place it. Max supports YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora and more. You can stand it vertically or horizontally as well. The Google Home Max will run you $399 when it launches this December, in both Chalk and Charcoal colors. It also comes with a free 12-month subscription to YouTube Red. Pixelbook \nWith the Home devices out of the way, Google shifted its focus to the new Pixelbook, which is calls a \u201chigh performance Chromebook.\u201d The Pixelbook measures in at just 10.3mm and 1.1 kilogram. With its 4-in-1 design, you can use it as a tablet, a laptop and anything in between. Specs include a 12.3-inch Quad HD LCD touchscreen, Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, up to 512GB of internal storage and 10 hours of battery life. \nThe Pixelbook can also instantly tether to your Pixel phone, supports all Google Play apps and is the first laptop with Google Assistant built in. The Pixelbook starts at $999 and the Pixelbook Pen accessory will sell for $99. Preorders start today, and the laptop will be available on October 31st. Pixel 2 \nThe sequel to last year\u2019s Pixel, the Pixel 2 isn\u2019t quite a revolutionary as we were hoping it might be. The design of the Pixel 2 is almost indistinguishable from that of last year\u2019s flagship, especially when it comes to the phone\u2019s 5-inch OLED display. The specs have been upgraded though, as the Pixel 2 comes equipped with a Snapdragon 835 chipset, 4GB of RAM and an improved 12-megapixel camera. \nThe Pixel 2 will be available in three different colors: Just Black, Clearly White and Kinda Blue. The 64GB model of the Pixel 2 will costs $649, while the 128GB model will retail for $749. Preorders go live today. Pixel 2 XL \nIf you\u2019re looking for a Google phone that does everything the Pixel 2 does, but has an even sleeker, more modern design, the Pixel 2 XL is the phone for you. Unlike the Pixel 2, the XL features a massive 6-inch pOLED display that stretches close to the edges of the phone. Most of the other specs are the same, but the Pixel 2 XL looks more like a phone from released in 2017. There are only two color options for the Pixel 2 XL: Just Black and Black & White. The 64GB costs $849, and the 128GB costs $949. Preorders go live today as well. Daydream View \nAs Google pushes further into AR with new software on its phones, it\u2019s also doubling down on VR with upgraded hardware. The new Google Daydream View headset can pair with the Pixel 2 or any other Daydream-ready phone an features high-performance lenses for better clarity and a wider field of view. The new View comes in three colors: Fog, Charcoal and Coral. You can preorder the updated View now for $99. Google Pixel Buds \nGoogle is taking on Apple\u2019s AirPods with a new products called the Pixel Buds. These wireless headphones charge in a pocket-sized charging case, automatically connect to your Android phone and offer up to 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. They also have gesture controls, so that you can swipe forward or backward on the right touchpad on the right earbud to control your music. But the most impressive demo that Google showed off had the Pixel Buds translating speech in real time between two people speaking two different languages. The Pixel Buds come in three colors (Just Black, Clearly White and Kinda Blue), cost $159 and will be available in November. Google Clips \nFinally, Google introduced a diminutive, hands-free camera called Google Clips. Set the camera down wherever you want and it will automatically capture moments as they happen. There\u2019s also a shutter button on the device and within the Google Clips app, so that you can manually snap shots as well. If you\u2019re using Google Photos, you can backup unlimited clips for free. Google Clips is coming soon to the US for $249.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T21:40:39.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9de0aa0b5508d66e152a94c0bc22cb4274ef129f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoRuTimvW9_C2T29UnRFZww6A4B_ik5k1.43OPr5sfiSbJB0XMlVQzFz9rZF_vIW_KUgLBeK0XQPwlDexCO2JS2mexhNFmrWcQ-", "site_full": "bgr.com", "site": "bgr.com", "site_section": "http://bgr.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BGR", "title": "New watchOS update fixes the Apple Watch\u2019s frustrating LTE connectivity bug", "title_full": "New watchOS update fixes the Apple Watch\u2019s frustrating LTE connectivity bug", "published": "2017-10-04T22:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2702, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9de0aa0b5508d66e152a94c0bc22cb4274ef129f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoRuTimvW9_C2T29UnRFZww6A4B_ik5k1.43OPr5sfiSbJB0XMlVQzFz9rZF_vIW_KUgLBeK0XQPwlDexCO2JS2mexhNFmrWcQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yoni Heisler", "published": "2017-10-04T22:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "New watchOS update fixes the Apple Watch\u2019s frustrating LTE connectivity bug", "text": "The recently introduced Apple Watch with LTE is without question the biggest update to the Apple Watch we've seen yet.

But boring things like exclusive distribution contracts aren\u2019t going to stop an opportunity for a good troll for T-Mobile. That\u2019s why it\u2019s offering a killer launch deal on the Pixel, despite not even selling the phone. \nIf you go out and buy a Pixel on your own dime and bring it to T-Mobile, the carrier will pay you half of the phone\u2019s cost upfront. There\u2019s a few terms and conditions attached, but here\u2019s the important part: T-Mobile has a way better offer than Verizon on the Pixel 2, a phone that\u2019s a Verizon exclusive and that T-Mobile doesn\u2019t even sell. That\u2019s some next-level trolling right there. Don't Miss : Our favorite Roku Stick and Fire TV Stick accessory gives you cord-free streaming for $6 \nAs always, you have to open a new line of service for at least a month if you want to qualify. Luckily, this time around, existing customers can participate: \n\u201cTo take advantage of T-Mobile\u2019s limited time offer of up to half off your Pixel 2, simply purchase an unlocked Pixel from Google, Verizon or other original retailer, port in a number or activate a new line of service, sign up for T-Mobile ONE and enter the deets at T-Mobile\u2019s online validation site. Existing customers can get in on the deal too when they add a line of T-Mobile ONE or Simple Choice Unlimited. Your money will be mailed to you in a MasterCard card (for a grand total of $325 or half the cost of a 64GB Pixel 2).\u201d \nTo really rub the salt into the wound, T-Mobile hired some digital billboards to drive around the Google event in San Francisco today: REMINDER: #NoVerizonRequired to get that new #GooglePixel ! Buy it and bring it to America\u2019s Best Unlimited network, people! #BYOPixel pic.twitter.com/OJ8ojFXhnM \n\u2014 John Legere (@JohnLegere) October 4, 2017 \nThere is one piece of bad news: T-Mobile confirmed to BGR that the Pixel 2 doesn\u2019t support LTE band 71, the band used by T-Mobile\u2019s brand-new 600MHz network . That makes the phone a non-ideal buy if you live in an area that will be getting 600MHz support in the near future, or if you\u2019re planning on holding onto your new phone for years, rather than upgrading next year.

It\u2019s all happening over a piece of technology that most users have no idea about, a chip that turns an iPod touch into an iPhone. \nAnd it sure looks like Qualcomm can\u2019t come out on top. Don't Miss : Our favorite Roku Stick and Fire TV Stick accessory gives you cord-free streaming for $6 \nNot only does Qualcomm make modems that allow devices to connect to a cellular network for calls and data, but the American company invented technologies that allow such connections. Without a cellular modem, the iPhone and any other smartphone would only connect to the internet when a Wi-Fi network is available. \nBecause Qualcomm was at the forefront of the mobile revolution, some of its inventions were turned into standards that are used by everyone in the business. And everyone pays royalties to the chipmaker for intellectual property rights, on top of actual hardware purchases. \nSo how did it all start? It\u2019s Bloomberg Businessweek that provides an extraordinary look at the chronology of the events, revealing details that we would otherwise miss. After all, unlike the Apple vs. Samsung battle where Apple accused Samsung of copying the iPhone, this is a legal fight over a critical piece of technology that must sound really boring to consumers. \nThe report reveals that Apple\u2019s Tim Cook may have convinced Samsung Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee some two summers ago to be more aggressive with Korea\u2019s Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) which started its Qualcomm investigation in 2014. \nApple, a long-time Qualcomm customers, did not like the fact that Qualcomm asks for royalties worth 5% of a device\u2019s price, which can amount to $30 for the iPhone, but much less for a cheap Android phone made in China. Apple drove that price down to about $10 per phone, but one of the conditions it agreed to was not to challenge Qualcomm\u2019s patents. That\u2019s not including the actual cost of the modem, which can retail for $18 for the most recent iPhones. \nIn August 2016, the KFTC interviewed Apple, prompting Qualcomm to say that Apple\u2019s statement contained lies. In the month that followed, Qualcomm stopped paying its usual rebates to Apple, raising that royalty rate. \nBy the end of 2016, the KFTC fined Qualcomm $850 million for \u201cabuse of market dominance.\u201d Three weeks later, the US FTC announced its own inquiry into Qualcomm\u2019s anticompetitive tactics. Apple followed with a suit of its own three days after the FTC, asking Qualcomm to pay $1 billion in damages and to reduce its royalties. In April, Apple cut off its royalty payments to Qualcomm altogether, which amount to some $2 billion per year. In addition to the immediate financial loss, Qualcomm\u2019s market cap was shattered by these events. \nIn early July, Qualcomm countersued Apple, saying the company infringed on six patents related to battery life and graphics processing and asked the US International Trade Commission (ITC) to ban iPhone imports. The ITC will issue a verdict by September 2018. \nOther companies then voiced their support for Apple, including Samsung and Google . Huawei is believed to be the second major smartphone maker to withhold royalty payments to Qualcomm. \nLed by Apple, the battle against Qualcomm might be a long one, considering that you can\u2019t make a smartphone on this planet and not pay Qualcomm its fees. It\u2019s a fight Apple would have liked to bring forward many years ago, Apple\u2019s general counsel Bruce Sewell told Bloomberg . But, at the time, it lacked an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chips. Now, there\u2019s Intel which is making its own LTE modems now, although they\u2019re not quite as performant as Qualcomm\u2019s. \nThis particular quote perfectly explains Apple\u2019s problem with Qualcomm: \nOn another table behind Sewell, an Apple representative has laid out two versions of the iPhone 7: One model, which has 128 gigabytes of memory was sold by Apple for $750. The other, which has 256 GB, sold for $100 more. How is it fair, Apple asks, for Qualcomm to charge as much as $5 more for the technology in the more expensive phone, given that the two devices are otherwise identical? \nPhilosophically speaking, anyone can charge whatever they want for a product. That\u2019s why Apple can ask $100 more for a memory upgrade, that costs Apple a lot less than that. Qualcomm set its own prices for years, and Apple \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 was willing to pay them. The problem with Qualcomm\u2019s technology is that it\u2019s an essential tech that should be priced \u201cfair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory,\u201d or Frand \u2014 again, that\u2019s the royalties, not the actual hardware. And that\u2019s why Apple is able to sue Qualcomm, and why regulators in various countries have already fined the company or are investigating it. \nOn the other hand, minimizing the importance of cellular connectivity, as Apple seems to do in this interview, seems out of place. \u201cCellular connectivity is important,\u201d Sewell said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not as important as it used to be.\u201d Yes, you can get online over Wi-Fi and use plenty of iPhone features without a cellular connection. But let\u2019s not forget that Apple sells hundreds of millions of iPhones every year, not iPod touches. And it\u2019s because of that cellular technology that people prefer to buy iPhones. \nWhatever happens in the future, it\u2019s clear that Apple will keep paying Qualcomm a fee for essential cellular technology used in an iPhone, even if the LTE chips will be made at Intel or in-house. But Qualcomm might have a tough time imposing its current royalty model to Apple and everyone else in the business. \nBoth parties do not seem to be ready to settle at this time, and it looks like both are ready for a long fight.

That doesn\u2019t make DxOMark\u2019s reviews irrelevant, as they provide ample explanations for their findings for every camera they analyze. It\u2019s just that a device, doesn\u2019t need a score for someone to declare it the \u201cbest camera in town.\u201d \nThe Galaxy Note 8 scored 100 points in the photo tests but didn\u2019t do as well in video tests, which explains why it tied with the iPhone 8. But this begs the obvious question: Can a phone go over 100 in these rankings? \nA phenomenal photo sub-score that breaks new ground as the first smartphone to hit 100 points makes the Note 8 the current class-leader for stills, thanks to excellent zoom quality, good noise reduction and detail preservation, as well as fast and accurate autofocus. The Note 8 doesn\u2019t quite match the same heights for video, where its sub-score of 84 is a little behind the best performers, such as the Google Pixel with 91 points, or the iPhone 8 Plus and the HTC U11, both with 89. \nWhat\u2019s interesting about the Galaxy Note 8 review, is that DxOMark team says the phone is \u201cthe best smartphone for zoom,\u201d which seems a lot let appreciative than \u201cthe best smartphone camera\u201d ever tested title used for the iPhone 8 Plus review. For reference, the iPhone 8 is a \u201csolid performance upgrade over the iPhone 7\u201d in DxOMark\u2019s review. \nThe iPhone X and Pixel 2 phones will receive similar treatments from the company, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they fare.

The sound they deliver is outstanding and way ahead of the competition. \nMind you, the review came out before Google actually unveiled the new Pixel 2 phones, which means Phone Arena was not able to test the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL\u2019s dual speaker setups. \nThe iPhone 8 did better than all the other phones when it comes to sound quality and loudness, with the iPhone 7 coming in second, ahead of the V30 and the Galaxy Note 8. However, the scores offered in the report aren\u2019t exactly backed up by any scientific explanations. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re meaningless, but just like the camera, not all of a speaker\u2019s features can be objectively measured so quality scores seem unnecessary. That said, the conclusion still stands: the iPhone 8\u2019s speakers are better than what\u2019s available from the best alternatives out there today.

Yankees starter Luis Severino only recorded a single out before he had to be replaced by reliever Chad Green.

With home field advantage, the 93-win Diamondbacks will send Zack Greinke (17-7) to the mound in hopes that he can continue succeed in what has been an impressive bounce back year. The Rockies will counter with Jon Gray (10-4), the young right-hander who only started 20 games this year, but managed to go 2-0 at Chase Field in Arizona. \nIf you want to watch the game tonight and have a cable subscription, just tune in to TBS at 8 PM ET.

Two kittens lie in the ruins of the ancient Agora in Athens June 20, 2015. (REUTERS/Paul Hanna) Everyone knows that Australia is absolutely packed with strange, wild creatures that could kill you at a moment's notice, but if you're a bird your number one enemy is still a familiar one: cats. According to a new study, both domestic and feral cats are on a murder spree in Australia, killing as many as one million birds every single day , and it's actually becoming a problem. The researcher, which was published in the journal Biological Conversation , suggests that wild cats in Australia nab 316 million birds every single year, while domesticated pet cats add another 61 million to that tally. It's a huge figure, and the scientists now believe that it could be a serious problem for bird species. \n\"Everyone knows that cats kill birds, but this study shows that, at a national level, the amount of predation is staggering,\" John Woinarski of the Charles Darwin University, who lead the study, says. \"It is likely to be driving the ongoing decline of many species.\" \nUsing data compiled from 93 different surveys, the researchers mapped the impact of cat predation on native species. The study discovered that an incredible 338 different species are preyed upon by cats in the country, including over 70 species considered threatened, and the felines are pushing them closer to extinction.

The phones will run Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box and will be guaranteed to run Android P, Android Q, and Android R in the future. \nGoogle quietly added a year of software updates compared to the Pixel family, while keeping in place the same limit for security updates \u2014 that\u2019s also three years. That\u2019s a great feature, one that many current Nexus and Pixel users would love to have.

Originally announced back in late 2015, the Mission E is a fully electric car set to be priced in the $85,000 range. Tentatively scheduled to hit the streets in 2019, Porsche boasts that the Mission E will have 310 miles of range and will hit 62 MPH in just 3.5 seconds flat.

Tesla\u2019s own vehicle lineup notwithstanding, most EV designs tend to be clunky eyesore. Early concept photos of the Mission E, though, revealed an incredibly sleek and beautiful design that certainly rivals anything Tesla has released. \nRecently, some new photos of the Mission E emerged, and it seems that the production design of the Mission E won\u2019t be all that different from the concept photos we\u2019ve already seen. \nInsideEVs reports : \nIf you are a fan of the Mission E concept, there is a good chance you are going to appreciate the production model as well.

But don\u2019t expect to get yours anytime soon, as various models are already sold out. \nThat sounds exciting, given that Google only started taking preorders the other day, soon after unveiling the phones. Sadly, it means nothing right now, and you\u2019ve probably guessed why: Google can\u2019t make phones. Don't Miss : Apple\u2019s hot BeatsX wireless earbuds were just discounted again on Amazon \nIf there\u2019s one thing everyone learned after so many Nexus and Pixel launches, is that Google can\u2019t make phones. Don\u2019t get that wrong, this has nothing to do with a phone\u2019s quality. The company is yet to master the logistics of manufacturing smartphones in large enough quantities to meet demand. \nRick Osterloh admitted during the event that Google hasn\u2019t been able to make enough Pixels last year, which is something Pixel fans remember all too well. He said the phones were very well received, which is great for Google\u2019s smartphone-making ambitions. But it never said how many Pixel units it actually shipped. \nAs it stands right now , the Pixel 2 XL is completely sold out, and you\u2019ll have to wait at least two weeks to get your preorder delivered. You can get yourself a black Pixel 2, as long as black will do as a color. Other models are also out of stock, with Blue versions having a 6-7 delay estimate. \nThese shipping estimates could be very telling for a phone like the iPhone. But not for the Pixel, as long as Google doesn\u2019t prove it can manufacture and ship massive Pixel quantities at launch. If you\u2019re still looking to get a Pixel as fast as possible, better look for one in other places, including Verizon and Best Buy stores. \nLet\u2019s just hope that Google learned a thing or two about managing supply chains and economies of scale for the Pixel 2. After all, with so much artificial intelligence and machine learning at its disposal, it certainly has the tools to improve its Pixel-making game, am I right?

And Google made sure everyone in the audience knows how proud it is to have the Pixel 2 rated as the best camera on DxOMark, the camera pros who recently said the iPhone 8 Plus is the best camera they ever tested, and then gave the Galaxy Note 8 the same rating. \nPixel 2 phones now have a 98-out-of-who-knows-what score, five points more than the iPhone 8 Plus and the Galaxy Note 8 . Don't Miss : Apple\u2019s hot BeatsX wireless earbuds were just discounted again on Amazon \nWe already addressed the matter of camera scores when talking about the Galaxy Note 8\u2019s review. Not all of a camera\u2019s features can be objectively measured, which is why it has always been strange to see DxOMark assign scores to the cameras it reviews, smartphones included. But we\u2019ll address it again, as it looks like 100 is not the limit. The Pixel 2 did not score 98 points out of a maximum of 100: \nWorried what happens when we get to 100? Don\u2019t be: Our new DxOMark Mobile test protocols and scoring system have plenty of headroom for new devices as they are introduced. There is nothing magical about the score of 100, and no reason that other cameras can\u2019t go past it. We\u2019re sure the time will come when they do! \nAccording to the review, the Google Pixel 2 sets a \u201cnew record for overall smartphone camera quality.\u201d Everything isn\u2019t perfect, however, and the experts did mention several issues including artifacts, zoom, and bokeh effects: \nWe\u2019re in danger of running out of superlatives when describing the major image quality attributes of the Google Pixel 2. That makes sense for a device that tops our scoring charts \u2014up from the 94 of the Apple iPhone 8 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 to a record-setting 98. So for just about any Photo or Video use case, it recommends itself as the phone camera with the best image quality. A notable exception to that assessment centers around the added performance in Zoom and Bokeh (including Depth and Portrait) that dual-camera smartphones such as the Apple iPhone 8 Plus and Galaxy Note 8 can provide. \nThe review also notes the Pixel 2 scores the highest video score for any device DxOMark tested \u2014 read the full review at this link .

Well, the wraps were already off thanks to months of leaks and rumors, but the phones were made official. As is the case with all leaks, they didn't really do a good job of painting a complete picture of Google's new premium smartphone lineup, which features a sleek new look that refines last year's design in a number of key areas. The glass panel on the back is far less offensive this year, for example, and the antenna lines have been hidden by a coating on top of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL's aluminum housing.\nThe new Pixel phones are sleek devices indeed. They also look much less like iPhones than last year's models, which is obviously a good thing.

What if we\u2019re all just living inside of a computer simulation? That\u2019s the idea behind a 2003 paper by Nick Bostrom, a philosopher from the University of Oxford. Since he published his work, countless scientists have jumped on board and supported his theory, and even Elon Musk says it\u2019s near-certain that this is all just a computer program. Now, a pair of physicists have done the math and determined that it\u2019s pretty much impossible. \nThe research, which was published in the journal Science Advances , centers on the required computational resources for supporting such a massive simulation as our own reality. In short, the researchers suggest that simulating and storing the data from even the tiniest aspects of what we know as reality would require a computer system so massive it would be unfathomable. Don't Miss : Hurry: Order a Super NES Classic right now on Amazon and you\u2019ll get it next week \n\u201cEven just to store the information about a few hundred electrons on a computer one would require a memory built from more atoms than there are in the universe,\u201d the researchers explain. The exponential increase in the amount of memory and processing power needed for each additional particle added to the simulation makes it not just impractical, but as far as we know, impossible. \nHowever, that\u2019s not quite the end of the debate. As the scientists acknowledge, we can\u2019t account for advances in computer technology that haven\u2019t yet occurred, and with quantum computing breaking new ground on a regular basis, it\u2019s impossible to predict what lies ahead. A computer system capable of such a simulation might one day look a lot more plausible, but at the moment it\u2019s nothing more than a science fiction dream. \nOf course, there\u2019s also the little issue of using our own universe as the model on which we\u2019re judging such a computer system. If we\u2019re to suggest that a computer system is simulating all of what we experience, why would we use our own models of physics and computing \u2014 which, if the simulation theory is correct, is just that, a simulation \u2014 to judge whether or not it\u2019s possible?

Not only is Netflix rather affordable, the streaming giant is continuously pumping out new content every single month. Case in point: this month alone, Netflix is rolling out 29 new original programs . \nWith Netflix throwing tons of money towards new productions, their costs are rising accordingly. Recall, Netflix is planning on spending upwards of $7 billion on content next year. That said, it\u2019s perhaps not too surprising that the average cost of a Netflix subscription for new and existing users is going to increase. Don't Miss : Apple\u2019s hot BeatsX wireless earbuds were just discounted again on Amazon \nThe price hike isn\u2019t anything outrageous, so there\u2019s really no reason to panic. The new pricing details are as follows: Starting in November the cost of a standard Netflix subscription will increase from $9.99 a month to $10.99. For users who take advantage of the service\u2019s premium plan, which offers support for 4K content and 4 concurrent streams, the price jumps from $11.99 to $13.99 per month. \nUsers who are just signing up for Netflix will be hit with the higher subscription rate immediately, beginning today. For existing users, the price increase won\u2019t take effect until next month. \nNetflix has raised their prices before, and while there\u2019s always some immediate backlash, it\u2019s hard to stay angry when Netflix keeps on pumping out more quality shows than the average user can realistically keep up with. And all things being equal, the value that Netflix provides relative to, say, a $100 cable subscription is pretty incredible.

But all of our attention will soon turn elsewhere, as Apple gets ready to release its first redesigned iPhone since 2014. The iPhone X has caused quite a stir since it was unveiled last month, primarily for two reasons. The first is obviously the \u201cnotch,\u201d which is a huge chunk of display that has been cut out from the top of the phone to make room for the TrueDepth camera system, other sensors, and the ear speaker. The second is the removal of Touch ID, since Apple and its partners aren\u2019t yet able to mass-produce a phone with a fingerprint scanner embedded beneath the display. \nComplaints have been sung far and wide. But the truth is no one will truly know how bad the notch is or whether Face ID is an adequate Touch ID replacement until the phone hits store shelves on November 3rd. Of course, now that the iPhone X has been unveiled, the rumor mill has already set its sights on next year\u2019s new iPhones. Don't Miss : Apple\u2019s hot BeatsX wireless earbuds were just discounted again on Amazon \nNotch and missing Touch ID scanner aside, it\u2019s hard to argue that the iPhone X\u2019s new design isn\u2019t stunning. The glass and stainless steel flow seamlessly together, creating continuous lines and a look that outshines every other phone on the market. There is one question we have about the phone though: Is it big enough? \nOn paper, the 5.8-inch display is larger than the 5.5-inch screen on the iPhone 8 Plus despite the fact that the iPhone X itself is so much smaller. Apple achieved this by removing the home button and switching to an OLED display that reaches almost all the way to the edges of the phone. But the aspect ratio is now 18.5:9 instead of 16:9, which means the display is much narrower than any other iPhone. Remember when Apple jumped from 3.5 inches to 4 inches on the iPhone 4 solely by making the screen taller? In terms of useful display real estate, it didn\u2019t really make much of a difference to the user experience. \nRumors are already swirling that Apple is planning an \u201ciPhone X Plus\u201d (if the phone is real, that won\u2019t be its name) next year, in addition to a followup to this year\u2019s 5.8-inch model. We know nothing else about this mythical phone, but we already know we want one. A larger phone would mean a bigger, wider display as well as a bigger battery, which is obviously always a good thing. \nWhile we eagerly await more info, Apple blog iDropNews posted a series of renders that show how an iPhone X Plus with a 6.4-inch display might compare to this year\u2019s iPhone X. A few images are included below, and you can see the rest in the blog\u2019s recent post .

Don't Miss : Apple\u2019s hot BeatsX wireless earbuds were just discounted again on Amazon \nWhich larger iPhone was Google talking about? Was this a hit at the iPhone X in particular, which will be a total nightmare for Pixel and Android sales this year? Or was it referring to the Plus line of iPhones in general? Let\u2019s look at everything. Again. A bit of history \nBefore the Pixels, there were Nexus devices. And in 2015, Google launched two different sized phones running pure Android: the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P. Given Google\u2019s comment, you\u2019d think the 2015 Nexus phones were almost identical twins. That\u2019s sweet, but completely wrong. \nIn addition to the obvious screen size differences, the bigger Nexus 6P had a faster processor, more storage, and a better selfie camera. It also had an AMOLED screen protected by Gorilla Glass 4 compared to the Nexus 5X\u2019s LCD and Gorilla Glass 3 setup, and an aluminum shell rather than plastic. Their designs? Also not similar. About size and lies \nThe Pixel phones are almost identical when it comes to hardware, that\u2019s true. What sets them apart are size-related differences, including screen, resolution, and battery capacity. The exact same thing is true of iPhones. The iPhone and iPhone Plus share the same specs aside from cameras. And this year\u2019s iPhone 8 and iPhone X series have identical specs, but yes, the iPhone X does have some advantages. \nWith its remark, Google implied that the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are identical while showing only one image of the backs of both Pixel 2 phones: \nImage Source: YouTube \nFake news times two. First of all, the phones aren\u2019t available in the same colors, that\u2019s kind of obvious. And I\u2019m just going to pretend their power buttons don\u2019t have different colors. \nBut turn them around, and you\u2019ll notice that the larger Pixel 2 indeed gets better features. It\u2019s got much smaller bezels and a sleeker look, while the Pixel 2 is stuck in the past with a hideous dual speaker front design. Like so: \nBut maybe Google didn\u2019t mean design features. iPhone X is not the larger device \nGoogle never identified the larger device it mocked, but it might have been referring to the iPhone X. That\u2019s the Apple flagship phone this year. \nBut the iPhone X is not the larger handset. That\u2019s fake. The iPhone 8 Plus is actually bigger than the iPhone X, which is about the same size as the iPhone 8. So no, Apple did not set aside special features for the larger device. It did so for the middle kid, if you want to be accurate when dissing it. \nYes, it\u2019s not just a bigger display, resolution, and battery that the iPhone X gets compared to its siblings. It also has an all-screen OLED display like nothing ever seen on an iPhone, and a sophisticated facial recognition system that\u2019s above and beyond what any other phone can do. It\u2019s all packed into a device that\u2019s barely larger than an iPhone 8. \nYes, there\u2019s also a dual rear camera on the back that\u2019s slightly better than the iPhone 8 Plus since it has dual optical image stabilization (OIS). And if we also consider design features, then yes, the iPhone X isn\u2019t like the iPhone 8. It\u2019s a lot better in many ways, but it also has some pitfalls. Just because I don\u2019t like Google\u2019s remark doesn\u2019t mean the iPhone X\u2019s notch is suddenly a stunning design element. \nThese are expensive innovations that can\u2019t be applied to all iPhones this year because Apple still wants to sell some 200 million iPhones annually. There\u2019s not enough supply or manufacturing capacity to make iPhone X screens and Face ID cameras for every iPhone model. But that will happen in the near future. \nCan Google do any of that this year? You know, design an all-screen compact phone with a dual camera on the back and an advanced facial recognition system? And I am talking about designing a phone from scratch, not cloning the iPhone design like it did last year, and then call it iconic this year. Can Google manufacture and sell 20 million Pixels this year? \nBut what if Google was really talking about the iPhone Plus? Are you really going after the iPhone Plus, Google? \nThis is the only case in which Google\u2019s remark has a chance of being true. The iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus had OIS cameras that weren\u2019t on their 4.7-inch counterparts. That was the only feature \u201csaved\u201d for the larger model. The iPhone 7 Plus added two extra features on top of that, including a dual camera on the back and the Portrait Mode. But the iPhone 7 did get OIS. \nThe iPhone 8 Plus is practically an upgraded iPhone 7 Plus that brings over a Portrait Lighting camera feature. The iPhone 8, meanwhile, is the corresponding iPhone 7 upgrade. \nEverything else is exactly the same, design included.

Coffee Lake is officially here, and it brings with it some impressive speed boosts that Intel hopes will help it stave off its biggest competition: AMD\u2019s Ryzen chips. \nAs has become the norm, the Coffee Lake generation launches with a handful of CPUs covering the i3, i5, and i7 tiers with both locked and unlocked clock speeds. The star of the show, however, is the mighty i7-8700K, a 6-core, 12-thread beast with a base clock of 3.7 GHz and a boost clock of up to 4.7 GHz. Don't Miss : WD\u2019s 1TB-4TB My Passport Ultra might be the perfect portable hard drive \nThe 8700K\u2019s primary competitors in price and capability are AMD\u2019s 8-core Ryzen 7 CPUs, and more specifically the Ryzen 7 1700X and 1800X. The top-of-the-line Intel chip retails for $359, while the 1800X debuted for $499 but can now be found for as low as $399. The 1700X launched at $399 and is now available for around $299. \nIn a variety of benchmark tests from across multiple reviews , the 8700K handily outpaces the AMD hardware roughly 60% of the time. In some of the other tests, the 8700K barely squeaks by, falls just shy, or comes up essentially even with AMD\u2019s go-to gaming chips. \nThese favorable performance ratings for the high-end Intel processor come with something of an asterisk, however. Generally speaking, most PC games don\u2019t play well with core counts higher than four, and the higher the cores, the less a game will benefit from the chip\u2019s true power. AMD\u2019s 8-core may well be capable of more heavy lifting than Intel\u2019s 6-core chip, but gaming benchmarks simply wouldn\u2019t bear that out. If you\u2019re interesting in the true capabilities of a chip, benchmarks for 3D rendering and video editing software are typically a more reliable metric. \nOverall, Coffee Lake seems to be a worthy successor to Kaby Lake, despite swooping in and cutting its predecessor\u2019s time in the spotlight a bit short. If you\u2019re one of those PC gamers or power users who demands the latest and greatest, you have some upgrading to do.

Don't Miss : Apple\u2019s hot BeatsX wireless earbuds were just discounted again on Amazon \nSanDisk has announced three different sets of industrial cards . First up are the standard SD cards, with capacities ranging from 8 \u2013 64GB and can operating temperatures as low as -25\u00b0C (-13\u00b0F) and as high as 85\u00b0C (176\u00b0F). There are also industrial microSD cards, which feature the same operating temperature, but go up to 128GB. SanDisk is also debuting the Industrial XI range of SD cards, which is virtually identical, save for the fact that it can survive temperatures as low as -40\u00b0C (-40\u00b0F).

AnandTech notes that previous industrial SD cards often topped out at 20 MB/s, which makes this a significant upgrade for those who need cards that can survive extreme climates. \nBoth these industrial cards and SanDisk\u2019s new automotive SD cards will be tested by OEMs in the coming weeks and months, so it might be some time before anyone can actually get their hands on these cards.

The article quotes sources familiar with the matter, who say that a contractor removed \"highly classified material\" from the NSA's network and put it on his home computer. Hackers working for the Russian government were then able to ID the files, thanks to the contractor's use of Russian-made antivirus software from Kaspersky Labs. \nThe incident occurred in 2015, according to the WSJ , but was not discovered until last year. The document stolen included details of \"how the NSA penetrates foreign computer networks, the computer code it uses for such spying and how it defends networks inside the U.S.\" \nThose stolen secrets are bad enough, but the attack would also appear to show that Russian hackers have been using commercial software to conduct wide-reaching surveillance in order to ID hacking targets.

The news comes courtesy of a Bloomberg report , and marks a big step up in where Amazon wants to position itself between buyers and sellers. \nThe report says that Amazon is trialing a new delivery service, called Seller Flex, with merchants on the West Coast. It involves Amazon picking up products from third-party sellers and shipping them to customers, rather than having third-party sellers handle the entire shipping process themselves.

Under the Seller Flex program, Amazon decides how products will be shipped, and handles the logistics chain from warehouse to customer.

Now, one Michigan mother is headed to jail due to her refusal to vaccinate, having already lost the battle in court. \nRebecca Bredow was ordered to have her son vaccinated by a judge after listening to arguments from her ex-husband, who supports the vaccination. She refused to comply, citing religious beliefs, and will now be taking up residence in a Michigan jail for failing to follow the judge\u2019s orders.

They\u2019re flagship devices, supposed to be similar except for size. But unlike their predecessors, they have radically different designs. The Pixel 2 is stuck in 2016, and it\u2019s not pretty. The Pixel 2 XL, meanwhile, sports the all-screen design that\u2019s characteristic for almost every 2017 smartphone flagship out there. \nBut both phones lack a dual-rear camera on the back, which is the one other key feature of 2017 high-end smartphones. Don't Miss : Apple\u2019s hot BeatsX wireless earbuds were just discounted again on Amazon \nApple did not invent dual cameras, but the iPhone 7 Plus made the dual camera a flagship staple, and others were quick to follow with similar designs. LG\u2019s G6 and V30 sport dual cameras (to be fair to LG, the G5 that launched before the iPhone 7 also had a dual camera). Samsung wanted one for the Galaxy S8 line but only squeezed a dual camera shooter in the Galaxy Note 8. The Galaxy S9 is already rumored to have the same photo technology. \nThe Huawei P10, the Essential Phone, the Nokia 8, and even OnePlus\u2019s iPhone 7 Clone have dual rear cameras. \nSo why not Google? Google explained during the show that the Pixel 2 lens is so good it can do bokeh effects and depth of fields tricks without a secondary shooter. \nGoogle believes it\u2019s able to match the performance of all those phones, including portrait pictures with blurred backgrounds, without needing extra hardware in the camera department. \n\u201c[There\u2019s] nothing we\u2019re missing for that feature set with that camera,\u201d Google\u2019s Mario Queiroz told a group of journalists at a briefing earlier this week, according to CNET . \nGoogle cameras come with a technology called dual pixel, which splits every pixel into two. Left and right sensors capture left and right photos, which is how Google achieves its bokeh effects on both the rear and front cameras. \nIn addition to that, there\u2019s an algorithm that Google created to identify a face and then pair it with hair, body, and everything else that\u2019s part of the subject. Once that\u2019s done, the camera focuses on the person, and the background is blurred. \nThat\u2019s definitely impressive, and Google says it trained the system using a million of hand-picked photos. But the camera review Google is most proud of says that while the Pixel 2 scores better overall than the iPhone 8 Plus and the Galaxy Note 8, it offers an inferior bokeh and zooming experiences. It turns out, two cameras are better than one. \nGoogle also told journalists that by not using a dual camera setup it had greater design freedom. That allowed the company to pack a bigger battery inside the Pixel 2 than the phone might otherwise have. \nThat\u2019s great and all. But as soon as the iPhone X comes out, a phone that\u2019s about as big as the Pixel 2, we\u2019ll see a phone that sports both a dual camera setup on the back and a battery almost as big as the Pixel 2.

MeTro addresses the other half of the equation, which is the fact that modern wound sealing techniques haven\u2019t seen huge progress in some time. \nRather than sewing human skin together, MeTro offers an alternative, and it\u2019s an option that is not only less invasive, but could actually provide a more sanitary seal than a suture. It could potentially be used on organs as well, and can be produced in such a way that its rate of degradation can be controlled. What\u2019s more, its creators say that the glue actually aids in tissue regeneration, potentially speeding up healing and recovery while also being less of a hassle for doctors and patients. \nIf this sounds like an incredible win/win/win, it\u2019s because, well, it is. Annabi\u2019s research group will continue their testing of the MeTro glue before moving on to actual clinical trials, but it\u2019s entirely possible that MeTro begins to replace traditional wound sealing techniques in some hospitals within five years.

ZDNet reports that the Uber app can read the screen buffer in iOS, allowing it to view and potentially record anything on your iPhone\u2019s screen without your knowledge. \nUber isn\u2019t doing this illicitly: Apple granted the app the permission. According to researchers, it\u2019s the only third-party app out there that has the ability to read the screen buffer. Don't Miss : Hurry: Order a Super NES Classic right now on Amazon and you\u2019ll get it next week \nUber told ZDNet that the ability was only intended for a very specific Apple Watch application, in which maps could render in the background on your iPhone, and then be pushed to your Apple Watch. Future versions of the Uber app will remove the code, a spokesperson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not connected to anything else in our current codebase and the diff [sic] to remove it is already being pushed into production,\u201d a spokesperson told ZDNet . \u201cSubsequent updates to Apple Watch and our app removed this dependency, so we\u2019re removing the API completely.\u201d \nThere are two issues at stake here. Uber having the ability to secretly record your device\u2019s screen is scary in its own right, given its previous history with tracking user data and locations. But the scarier problem is the potential for Uber\u2019s permissions to be used by hackers. If someone could compromise the Uber app through a security flaw, they\u2019d be able to use the app\u2019s screen recording privilege to spy on any number of things on your device, including two-factor auth texts and passwords.
