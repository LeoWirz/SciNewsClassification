What\u2019s in a name? \nThe Clips name could also represent some kind of clip-on wearable device, which could also be used for capturing video. \nWithin that context, \u2018clips\u2019 could also be placed around a smart home for use in conjunction with the Google Home range. \nRegardless, the inventory sighting has added a little more intrigue to a rumoured launch line up that has suffered a slew of recent leaks. \nElsewhere, today\u2019s report also tells us a little more about the Pixelbook, which Google is likely pitching against Microsoft\u2019s Surface range. \nAccording to the inventory it\u2019ll have a 12.3-inch screen and will be powered by an Intel Core i5 processor. \nGoogle\u2019s event starts at 5pm UK time (9am PST/12pm EST) and we\u2019ll have full coverage of all the product launches as they happen. \nWhat are you most looking forward to at the Google Pixel event tomorrow?

U11 Life (AndroidOne program) \n\u2014 LlabTooFeR (@LlabTooFeR) October 3, 2017 \nA 5.2-inch Full HD display, 16MP front and rear -facing cameras, and HTC\u2019s Edge Sense and USonic tech, were among the specs that revived a dose of added credence via the new leak. But LLabTooFeR\u2019s post also noted that the U11 Life will come in version with 3GB or 4GB or RAM and 32GB or 64GB of on-board storage respectively, and the battery will weigh in at 2600mAh. \nThese specs point towards an solid mid-range Android smartphone, but the more interesting side of the U11 Life is that it\u2019s set to be the first Android One phone. \nAndroid One is the name give to Google\u2019s initiative to have pure Android on mobiles made by other manufacturers, which normally sport some form of additional skin, apps or user interface on top of the base Android operating system. \nHowever, fiddling around with Android can lead to slower and less slick performance on some handsets, as well as add a level of clutter and replication to the native apps found on handsets from major phone makers. \nThe likes of Motorola and HMD Nokia have seen more mobiles made with stock or almost stock Android, and the Android One initiative looks to build upon that by offering more devices with a pure Android experiences out of the box. \nThe U11 Life is set to adopt Android One and will sport a pure version of Android 8.0 Oreo, while rumours and leaks point to a second version of the smartphone that\u2019ll have Android Oreo but with HTC\u2019s Sense UI added on top. \nSo far the HTC U11 Life is squaring up to be a pretty decent Android One phone. But for people wanting a flagship level smartphone with pure Android, they will have to wait for Google\u2019s next Pixel handsets set to make their debut October 4. \nDoes the idea of an Android One phone appeal to you?

So unless people upgrade their Android handsets regularly, this disparity in Android distributions is set to continue. \nBut even the the top-of-the-line smartphones like the Galaxy S8 still take time to get the latest version of Android pushed out to them, and may only be upgraded a good few months after the latest Android version has been released; Google even draws the line at pushing out updates to some of its older Nexus devices, despite their stock-Android credentials. \nThis situation means there\u2019s not likely to be the end of fragmentation in the Android phone arena anytime soon. \nIn comparison, around 80% of Apple iOS devices are running iOS 10, and MacRumours notes that 24 hours after the launch of the iOS 11 10% of iPad and iPhone users had downloaded the new OS.

The idea is that you\u2019ll be able to use it as a smartphone, and then fold it out to full tablet size, creating a whole new mobile segment that mirrors the tablet-laptop 2-in-1 hybrids we\u2019ve already seen from the computing industry. \nBut the bad news is that Samsung\u2019s quirky folding phone might be tough to bag, with Forbes\u2019 Ewan Spence suggesting that \u201cthe expectation for the Galaxy X is as a limited-run device in a single territory \u2013 more than likely the home territory of South Korea\u201d. \nIn a lengthy report detailing the prospects of the Galaxy X smartphone, Spence argues that the phone will \u201cbecome one of the rarest\u201d Android handsets in 2018, and that customers will need \u201cthe quickness of a falcon and the cunning of a fox\u201d to bag one, due to the possibility of a limited release. \n\u201cThat follows the pattern of the first curved screen display on a Samsung device, with 2014\u2019s Note Edges available in South Korea and India, but not making a worldwide release,\u201d he writes. \nSpence continues: \u201cNo matter when Samsung decides to reveal the X, the chances are it\u2019s going to be a collector\u2019s item before it hits retail shelves. If you want a piece of the next-generation of display technology, you\u2019ll have to be fast.\u201d \nIt wouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise to see a limited release for the Galaxy X; Samsung often uses select-market releases to trial new technology. If folding phones turn out to be a success, Samsung would then have cause to instigate a wider release \u2013 with the possibility of the UK being included. \nMost rumours \u2013 and Spence\u2019s report \u2013 suggest that the Galaxy X will initially debut to press early next year, at either CES 2018 in January or MWC 2018 in February. However, Samsung hasn\u2019t confirmed any such plans, so take all leaks with due caution until then. \nWhat do you think about the prospect of a folding Samsung smartphone?

To stretch the current British political metaphor, it was \u2018many cores for the few\u2019 people who had enough cash to buy a high-end processor and ultra-expensive motherboard. \nThis year saw AMD apply a \u2018many cores for the many\u2019 attitude, aggressively launching its eight-core Ryzen processors into the CPU market. Prices started at under \u00a3350, whereas Intel\u2019s quad-core equivalents were costing around the same. Intel would have to employ some serious price reductions to remain competitive. \nAMD was afforded much well-earned goodwill as a result. After all, the company had completely changed the CPU market and blown away much more expensive Intel chips in one fell swoop. \nJumping to today, and Intel has launched what in this narrative can be seen as its direct response to Ryzen. For the first time, consumer-level desktop processors go from four cores to six. Combined with Intel\u2019s reputation for mighty overclocking ability and efficient IPC (instructions per clock figures), this could be seen as the company immediately taking the fight to AMD. \nSo what does Intel have to offer? For this launch, the company has sent over its two biggest hitters for enthusiast gamers and system builders. The Core i7-8700K with six Hyper-Threaded cores for a total of 12 threads, is Intel\u2019s chip for the most demanding users \u2013 those who want to blow a wad of cash for the ultimate in performance. \nThe i5-8400, on the other hand, is a slightly more sedate six-core processor without Hyper-Threading. This is the sort of chip you\u2019re likely to find on mid-range pre-built gaming PCs. I\u2019ll be covering this in a separate review. Perhaps most exciting is the overclockable Core i5-8600K, another overclockable processor for a much more affordable price of \u00a3280. \nRelated: Everything you need to know about 8th-gen Intel Core Intel 8th-generation (Coffee Lake) processors \u2013 Technology, specifications and chipset \nThe biggest change between 7th-gen and 8th-gen processors is core count. There\u2019s been a 50% increase in the number of cores from four to six, and the same increase in threads from eight to 12. This is the single-biggest factor when it comes to performance of these new chips, but it isn\u2019t the only enhancement that Intel has applied to these new products. \nThis increase in cores is reflected in the whole lineup (see the table below). Core i5 chips now all get six cores instead of four, plus i3s get four cores for the first time. \nNot only are there a greater number of cores, but there\u2019s an updated underlying architecture. Without going too in-depth, it presents a small step up from the previous generation of desktop processors. Where 7th-gen chips used the Kaby Lake architecture, 8th-gen uses Coffee Lake. Both technologies are derived from 6th-gen Skylake, which used a 14-nanometer production process. Briefly, the smaller the production process, the more transistors you can fit onto a given piece of silicon. The more efficient this process, the more efficient the resulting chip. Consuming less power and creating less heat, this will result in even better performance.

Coffee Lake comes in as 14nm++. In addition to the modified process, Intel is also touting improved overclocking potential, an improved eXtreme Memory Profile (XMP) and even the ability to modify RAM timings without having to reboot your PC each time. \nBefore I move onto my initial performance findings, let\u2019s take a look at the full \u2018Premium Performance\u2019 (otherwise known as Coffee Lake-S) lineup.

Dubbed Amazon Go, the supermarket would use a combination of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning to automatically detect when products are taken from or return to shelves \u2013 keeping track of them in a virtual cart. Once you leave with your goods, your Amazon account is charged automatically. \nIt was a revolutionary idea, and it almost certainly caused a stir amongst traditional supermarkets who have long sought ways to reduce costs \u2013 like swapping staff for machines. \nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that Tesco is investigating similar technology. Asked whether Tesco is looking at the checkout-free model during a press conference, Tesco CEO Dave Lewis said: \u201cWe trial lots and lots of things \u2013 the thing you refer to, yes \u2013 but we\u2019ll only talk about it when we\u2019ve done it everywhere.\u201d \n\u201cThe idea that I would come to the market and say, in this one shop we are \u2013 I\u2019ve got 3,600 shops,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen we\u2019re at a place where we\u2019ve got something we want to launch to all customers, we\u2019ll launch it and we\u2019ll communicate it. We\u2019ve been doing it for a while. Nothing to announce.\u201d \nLewis was also probed by Business Insider on the possibility of launching a subscription meal box service like those offered by HelloFresh or Gusto, to which he responded : \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we couldn\u2019t put together ingredients and service it to customers as a meal kit in stores if that\u2019s what they want from us.\u201d \nHe went on: \u201cThere are a number of trials in our stores about exactly that so we can change our offer if ultimately that\u2019s how customers want us to operate. We test a whole lot.\u201d \nWhat do you think about checkout-free stores? Let us know via Facebook or Twitter.

These include a new Fitness Age score, which is based on your VO2 Max. It\u2019s great to see VO2 Max estimations finally come to TomTom devices, as it\u2019s historically been a rather strange absence considering all the component pieces required were present. This will compare you against other people in your demographic and is designed as an extra measurement metric and layer of motivation. \n\nYou\u2019ll also earn new Fitness Points based on your Fitness Age. The more intense your workouts, the more Fitness Points you\u2019ll accrue. It\u2019s designed to make you want to run more than just walk, as an example. Finally, there will be Personalised Workouts, covering running and cycling, available to follow from your wrist. The updates are expected to roll out in September and look to be welcome improvements. \nOur original review continues below. What is the TomTom Spark 3? \nThe TomTom Spark 3 is, as the name suggests, the third-generation GPS running watch from maps and satnav specialist, TomTom. \nThe Spark 3 offers running, cycling and swimming tracking, alongside daily activity and sleep monitoring. It features a built-in optical heart rate monitor and can store music on-board to playback through Bluetooth-connected headphones, which are included in some package options. All this adds up to a complete package that doesn\u2019t require either a chest strap or smartphone for use. \nThe addition of a compass in this particular model means the Spark 3 is able to offer route tracking, and has the ability to guide you back to your start point or follow uploaded routes. So explorers can head out worry-free, even if without a smartphone. \nThe Spark 3 is available in four variations: the standard model (\u00a3119.99); Music+Headphones (includes built-in MP3 player, \u00a3149.99); TomTom Spark 3 Cardio (includes optical HRM, \u00a3169.99); and Cardio+Music (includes MP3 player and optical HRM, \u00a3219.99). I reviewed the top-end model. \nLike the previous generation, there\u2019s also the identically featured TomTom Runner 3 range, which has a slightly different strap design but is available in the same variations and provides the same level of functionality. \nWatch: Trusted Explains \u2013 Wearables and Fitness Trackers \nTomTom Spark 3 \u2013 Design and Setup \nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it \u2013 right? That appears to be TomTom\u2019s thinking with the Spark 3, which hasn\u2019t changed significantly in the looks department since the first version. \nThe current Spark 3 is sleek, slim, comfortable and features a four-way control pad that works perfectly. The monochrome screen is clear and helps with light or dark viewing at a glance, which is ideal for running. It\u2019s also possible to turn on a backlight by covering the screen with your hand. \nThe strap, which can be swapped out for different colours, is also super simple to clip into place. Offering some elasticity, it sits comfortably in position while remaining tight enough for wrist-based optical heart rate tracking. I barely noticed the watch was on, found it fitted under most sleeves and was even fine to wear it in bed without any discomfort. \nTomTom has done well to deliver a no-frills design that just works. Some might argue that the design is becoming a little stale \u2013 or that it isn\u2019t the best-looking watch out there \u2013 but it\u2019s a functional finish that works well for a technical training device such as this. The Garmin Fenix 3 offers far more data and smarts, but it\u2019s so large and heavy that wearing it day-to-day can become a hassle; there\u2019s no such issue with the Spark 3. TomTom Spark 3 \u2013 Activity Tracking \nWhen it comes to GPS tracking, TomTom is a veteran. The Spark 3 is a great example of this with super-accurate and consistent tracking of routes and, on the whole, quick acquisition of GPS signal. The only time this wasn\u2019t the case was when I went abroad; finding a signal took up to 10 minutes. That said, I didn\u2019t have a phone connected that offers QuickGPSfix, which uses the phone\u2019s location to help triangulate the watch faster. \nRelated: Best Fitness Trackers \nNew to the Spark 3 is the addition of a compass, which allows it to offer a route-tracking feature. This means you can go out, get lost, and still find your way back to the start using an on-screen trail line. Think of it like digital breadcrumbs. \nThe watch lets you zoom in and out, so you can stay on track back to the start point. Crucially, it isn\u2019t too pushy, so you can take the route of your choosing back to the start point \u2013 a great way to make you feel free and secure at the same time. \nThe routes go beyond finding your way home; you can also upload trails. This is achieved by saving previous routes that you want to do again, or even by downloading .GPX files from the internet and putting them on the watch. \nThis means it will be possible to plan routes online, or use those already shared by others through services such as Strava, in order to get out and run a specific route. The integration could be simpler, though, perhaps using TomTom\u2019s MyDrive route planner, which allows you to plan and easily upload .GPX routes for cars to TomTom\u2019s satnavs. \nHeart rate tracking comes built into the watch by way of an optical HR monitor. Say what you will about wrist-worn heart rate accuracy, but I found this to be one of the better examples. \nWhen compared with a chest strap on a competitor device, the Spark 3 held its own. Heart rate was accurate, but I did notice a little lag when out. Doing hill runs, for example, meant spikes in heart rate that the watch struggled to display immediately. \nThat said, on looking at the data when synced afterwards, it appeared to have recorded accurately. In fact, since most people are likely to train in zones, rather than looking at tiny heart rate detail variations, this shouldn\u2019t be an issue; zone movements appeared to keep up. \nRelated: Best Calorie Counter Apps: 5 best food diaries for Android and iOS \nAs you might expect, heart rate tracking doesn\u2019t work for swimming. Also, you\u2019re limited to indoor tracking only where you set the pool length. While this was accurate, it won\u2019t help open water swimmers \u2013 but since they\u2019re likely triathletes, who aren\u2019t really the target market of such a watch, it\u2019s no big deal. That said, open water swimming and heart rate monitoring while swimming are both features found on the admittedly more expensive Apple Watch Series 2. TomTom Spark 3 \u2013 App and Guidance \nThe TomTom MySport app is okay, but it still has some work to do. While the app can be connected via a smartphone for quick syncing of data to analyse training, it can be glitchy to connect. In addition, you still have to connect to a PC to save or upload routes and to transfer music across to the device. \nAll that said, the app is clean, easy to use and works well for the sports for which it is tailored. \nIt\u2019s a shame you can\u2019t link up sports for triathlon training, however. There are workouts you can activate to work on targets, such as running a 26-minute 5K pace or a 3-mile run in under 25 minutes, for example. These have you racing against a virtual partner, with the screen showing if you\u2019re ahead or behind and by how far \u2013 a really great motivator to keep your pace up. \nBut when compared to the competition from Garmin and Polar, however, there\u2019s a lack of training programs on offer and any guidance from the data collected. That said, the price point and simplicity of the Spark 3 do position it as a device that\u2019s more for beginners. \nThankfully, the TomTom Spark 3 does play nice with other platforms. That means you can share you exercise information with platforms such as Strava, MapMyRun, Runkeeper, Endomondo, MyFitnessPal and more, helping to mitigate the lackluster MySports experience. \nRelated: Best Headphones for Running \nWhile the TomTom Spark 3 can track daily activity and is super-easy to use and read while training, it won\u2019t offer smartphone notifications. \nHowever, with the Spark 3, TomTom isn\u2019t going after the smartwatch market, but rather staying focused on being a GPS watch. As such, the inclusion of a built-in music player and Bluetooth headphone connectivity means that there\u2019s no need to take out a phone with you when you\u2019re training. TomTom Spark 3 \u2013 Battery Life and Charging \nTomTom says you should be able to get a good five hours of GPS, HR and music on the go. Alternatively, using GPS, the watch should last for around 11 hours on a charge. \nIn reality, TomTom\u2019s figures are pretty accurate. In fact, I was impressed by how long the music player worked and found myself using the watch and Bluetooth headphones as my go-to music player when out and about since it\u2019s so easy to use. \nCharging requires a dedicated cradle that has a USB cable end. That means it can be easily plugged into your other USB plugs, wall sockets, a laptop or anything else that has a USB port. The clip also fits and locks well, so you know it\u2019s charging, and it won\u2019t come loose in the way of some of the magnetic options used by rival running watches. \nThe included Bluetooth headphones are good for four hours of playback according to TomTom. I found this to be an underestimate, if anything. These beauties kept going even when blasting out music at a decent volume \u2013 loud enough to drown out cars when running on busy roads, so be sure to stay aware of your surroundings. The bass is slightly lacking, though, so it\u2019s likely battery savings are made that way. But we\u2019d prefer longevity over bass any day for headphones used just for running. Should I buy the TomTom Spark 3? \nThe Spark 3 is an ideal GPS watch for those looking to start out in running, cycling or swimming as well as regular exercisers. It lacks some of the more intricate metrics that rival devices offer that are likely to appeal to more hardcore exercisers, but the price and clear layout make the Spark 3 an attractive proposition. \nYou\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find another watch that offers GPS tracking, optical heart rate monitoring, on-board music plus that track-back compass-powered feature all in one \u2013 the fact that TomTom offers all of this for \u00a3220 is amazing. \nThis watch is comfortable, well-sized for day-to-day use and offers activity tracking. Those who are after smartwatch functions such as phone alerts will be disappointed, though \u2013 this is very much an exercise-focused device. \nThe TomTom Spark 3 really does pack in a lot for the price. Despite being cheaper than a lot of the competition, this watch allows the wearer to get out minus a connected smartphone. That freedom is something lots of people seek when exercising, but in the past has meant sacrificing music. \nWhile tracking of position via GPS and optical heart rate monitoring are both impressive and work well, there\u2019s little to be done with that data. More after-training analysis, pre-training plans and a general tweak of the app to work without a PC would be welcome additions to perfect this otherwise excellent GPS watch. \nBattery life, even with HR tracking and Bluetooth music playing while in GPS mode, will be more than adequate for daily users and charging is a simple process. \nThe TomTom Spark 3 is a comprehensive offering that works well and is offered at an affordable price, which makes for a very compelling GPS sports watch indeed. Verdict \nThe TomTom Spark 3 is an all-encompassing GPS sports watch that means you can leave your smartphone behind.

If the dialog and the app are still visible, then it\u2019s a system dialog.

Here\u2019s everything we know so far, including its price and release date, as well as details of the affordable Roku Express. \nRoku makes some of the best and most accessible streaming products around, including the Roku 3 and the Roku Streaming Stick , but so far the UK hasn\u2019t been treated to a 4K streamer from the US-based company \u2013 despite it launching its first Ultra HD model, the Roku 4, in the States as far back as 2015. \nThat\u2019s all changed now, though, with the firm revealing that recently announced UHD dongle the Roku Streaming Stick+ is set to land imminently here in Blighty. \nFirst announced on October 2 in America, the Stick+ packs a quad-core processor and support for 4K and HDR content at up to 60fps \u2013 the same frame rate offered by the new 4K Apple TV . \nStandard HD flicks and shows will obviously be supported, too, while those searching for stuff to watch in Ultra HD will find a \u2018one stop shop\u2019 in the form of Roku\u2019s native 4K Spotlight channel. There\u2019s also dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi onboard, so buffering shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \nThe Streaming Stick+ will go on sale online from October 19, ahead of hitting High Street retailers by November \u2013 which, conveniently, is just in time for Black Friday 2017 , so keep an eye out for deals on Roku gadgets old and new. \nIt\u2019s set to retail for \u00a379.99, which is reasonable \u00a330 bump over the bog standard Roku Streaming Stick, which carries a \u00a350 RRP. \nLooking for an even more affordable streamer? \nThe Stick+ is joined in Roku\u2019s refreshed UK lineup by an upgraded Roku Express, a basic set-top box that offers streaming in 1080p and will be priced at just \u00a330 from October 19. \nShare your thoughts on Roku\u2019s new Streaming Stick+ by tweeting us @TrustedReviews. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roku", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "roku", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roku express", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ultra hd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roku streaming stick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple tv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roku", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T21:07:56.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe4cbce5dc17b829a9bf04b0f70c7f90d8c0e32e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OVyheN3E7PBokQs9EGYUweqWXE.7zZWje9vx1wI9Y9eFqOVtk96caGScAouIB2VhZaVlXPFk_ag--", "site_full": "www.trustedreviews.com", "site": "trustedreviews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "cell_phones", "tech", "computer_reviews"], "section_title": "", "title": "reMarkable Paper Tablet hands-on | Trusted Reviews", "title_full": "reMarkable Paper Tablet hands-on | Trusted Reviews", "published": "2017-10-14T04:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.299, "main_image": "http://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/54/2017/05/r.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2665, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 30, "comments": 0, "shares": 30}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe4cbce5dc17b829a9bf04b0f70c7f90d8c0e32e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.OVyheN3E7PBokQs9EGYUweqWXE.7zZWje9vx1wI9Y9eFqOVtk96caGScAouIB2VhZaVlXPFk_ag--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Max Parker", "published": "2017-10-14T04:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "reMarkable Paper Tablet hands-on | Trusted Reviews", "text": "View All reMarkable Paper Tablet hands-on: The notebook of the future \nThe reMarkable Paper Tablet is an interesting proposition. It\u2019s targeted at those people who still love the texture, feeling and simplicity of paper \u2013 the team behind it tell me there are lots of such folk \u2013 but who also want something connected, smart and that can be backed up. \nThe reMarkable is pretty much paper for the 21st century. \nRelated: Best tablets \nThe reMarkable is best described as a combination of an iPad Pro equipped with an Apple Pencil, and a Kindle . It\u2019s the size of the iPad, but the display is electronic paper, like the Kindle. It\u2019s also very basic \u2013 but then that\u2019s sort of the point. You won\u2019t be watching movies on it, playing games or even browsing the web; the reMarkable Paper Tablet is for drawing, writing and reading. \nYou might believe this all sounds rather limiting \u2013 but, in fact, it\u2019s this device\u2019s strongest feature. Ditching the additional capabilities available on other devices sets the reMarkable apart. \nThe 10.3-inch high-resolution screen, for example, actually feels like paper. It has a texture that isn\u2019t possible with glass-coated LCD, and that instantly makes writing with the pen feel more natural. I\u2019ve tried replacing my paper notebook with an iPad Pro, but it doesn\u2019t come anywhere near to the feeling of actually writing on paper that I get from the reMarkable. \nOddly, the pen isn\u2019t supplied with the tablet; it\u2019s a $79 additional purchase. I can\u2019t imagine anyone buying this without the pen, so it would\u2019ve made more sense for it to be included in the package. \nWhile the textured, higher-friction surface makes this feel like paper, it\u2019s the minimal latency when you\u2019re writing or drawing that keeps the feeling going. The team behind the tablet told me it\u2019s the \u201cworld\u2019s fastest digital paper\u201d, and while I didn\u2019t have anything on hand to compare it to, it did feel almost instantaneous from pressing the tip down to my scrawls appearing on the display. That short, but very noticeable, lag you\u2019d experience when writing on a tablet isn\u2019t there with the reMarkable. \nOne of the reMarkable\u2019s real strengths is its ability to be a great tool for artists. I was shown a number of sketches and attempted some myself, and the level of detail you can achieve is impressive. The size of the screen might limit those who prefer a big canvas such as a Wacom Mobile Studio Pro , but if you\u2019re used to a typical sketchpad then you\u2019ll feel right at home. You have access to various pen types; the stylus is pressure-sensitive, so you can accurately shade and alter thickness by pressing harder; and there are a few extra features for importing your work into Adobe Illustrator. \nAs a piece of design, the reMarkable is the opposite of its name. The version I used was a prototype, but I was told the final design will be much the same. It\u2019s a clean-looking, plastic device that\u2019s about the same size as an A4 sheet of paper.

Battery life isn\u2019t quite on a par with a Kindle \u2013 which often lasts a month \u2013 but I was assured that you\u2019ll get through a heavy working week without needing to reach for the charger. \nThe software has been developed specifically for the reMarkable and, like the design and functionality, it\u2019s intentionally simple. There\u2019s no browser or email client, but there are plenty of nice touches that demonstrate how much thought has gone into the development of the device. \nThe homescreen is laid out like a library, combining your drawings, books and notes into a grid. There\u2019s a search box at the top, which will eventually support searching inside documents thanks to OCR (optical character recognition), and it has options to delve deeper into specific content if there\u2019s a lot. There\u2019s no ebook store, so if you\u2019re planning to use the device for reading then you\u2019ll have to get your books from elsewhere. \nArguably the most important aspect of the software is the custom cloud infrastructure and companion apps. Desktop, iOS and Android apps will be available and include live syncing between the tablet and your other devices. \nI\u2019d have liked for the syncing aspect to be more open, so you could choose your service \u2013 Google Drive, Dropbox and so on \u2013 rather than being pushed into reMarkable\u2019s own solution. If my notes could instantly be available on my smartphone through Drive, then this product would be even sweeter. \nYou will be able to livestream from the reMarkable to a computer, however, which appears to make it an ideal tool for meetings and group working. \nRelated: Best e-readers First Impressions \nAfter using the device for a few hours to both take notes and draw, I was charmed by the reMarkable. It\u2019s a niche product, yet it will be invaluable for those who can really get the most from it. \nThe sensation of writing on the high-friction surface is the best digital representation of paper I\u2019ve tried, and that instantly puts its above using a consumer tablet such as the iPad Pro. \nBut the biggest barrier to entrance for this device is surely going to be the price. And, of course, the availability. The reMarkable Paper Tablet was originally conceived on Kickstarter and if you backed it there, you would have got yourself a decent deal. Prices started at $379 (around \u00a3295), and those units will begin shipping from August. \nHowever, if you want to buy one now, you\u2019ll be paying more. The tablet will cost $529 (\u00a3411) and the pen $79 (\u00a361). There\u2019s a 33%-off promotion on currently, but that\u2019s unlikely to last much longer. Also, ordering it now will see it ship in October, which is quite a long wait. \nThe reMarkable\u2019s obvious rival, Sony\u2019s DPT-RP1, is even more expensive at $799 (\u00a3620), so the price isn\u2019t unreasonable. But until it becomes more accessible, the reMarkable will remain a niche product.

OnePlus 5T = fake? \nNot everyone is convinced though. According to HotHardware , one web user called the phone an \u201cobvious fake.\u201d Another said the image \u201cpoorly edited left display corning using old OP5 wallpaper.\u201d \nThe low resolution of the photo has also been used to call its authenticity into question. \nIf backed into a corner we\u2019d probably lean towards this not being the real deal. The OnePlus 5 has been on sale for a little under four months. It\u2019s still extremely popular among critics and users alike. \nIt\u2019s unlikely that a major design shift like this would be revealed so soon after the OnePlus 5 release date. \nAlso, perhaps we shouldn\u2019t read too much into the current-gen device being sold out. OnePlus is hardly renowned for managing supplies of its handsets efficiently. \nWhat do you think? Are we looking at the next OnePlus flagship handset?

If buyers want to use their old 3.5mm jack headphones on such a device, they\u2019ll need to fork out for a $9 adapter. \nGoogle followed Apple\u2019s suit with the new Google Pixel 2 , which was launched earlier this month. Unlike the original Google Pixel (2016), the Google Pixel 2 has no 3.5mm audio jack, leaving many would-be customers frustrated with the prospect of having to either buy an adapter or pick up a new pair of USB-C headphones. \nWhat made the matter worse is that Google was initially peddling its adapter dongle for a hefty price of $20 \u2013 ouch! \nThe good news is that Google has since decided to reduce the price of this adapter to a much more manageable $9, putting the dongle in line with Apple\u2019s own offering. \nStill, the removal of the headphone jack is quickly becoming a trend in the mobile industry, and is almost certainly going to be adopted by more phone makers in 2018 and beyond. \nSome phone companies have been resistant to the change. One notable example is OnePlus, which polled users on Twitter to see whether customers were keen to see the headphone jack retained. Then, when the OnePlus 5 launched earlier this summer, fans were pleased to see that the 3.5mm audio jack had been kept on. \nWhat do you think of the new Google Pixel 2?

Canon says that the 24.2MP APS-C CMOS is similar to that used in its popular EOS 80D DSLR, offering a sensitivity range of ISO100-25,600. The firm\u2019s Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology is onboard enabling on-chip phase detection, and even from my short time using of the camera, it\u2019s clear that autofocus is impressively quick. The sensor is coupled with Canon\u2019s latest Digic 7 processor, which enables EOS-like image processing features such as Auto Lighting Optimizer for balancing difficult illumination conditions, and Diffraction Compensation for sharper-looking images when shooting at small apertures. The NB-13L battery offers 200 shots per charge, or 250 in Eco mode. USB charging is available \nCanon says that the built-in 15-45mm f/2.8-5.6 lens has been specifically matched to the sensor for optimal image quality. It has an impressively close minimum focus distance of 10cm at wideangle, dropping to a still-respectable 30cm at the long end. The lens includes optical image stabilisation promising 4 stops benefit, a switchable 3-stop neutral-density filter, and a 9-bladed aperture diaphragm for attractive background blur. However despite the large sensor, the f/5.6 maximum aperture means that the G1 X III\u2019s lens won\u2019t give any more background blur than those on 1in sensor cameras like the Sony RX100 V and Panasonic Lumix LX15, that have f/2.8 apertures at the 70mm equivalent setting. \nContinuous shooting specs are very decent, at 7 frames per second with autofocus between frames, or 9 fps with the focus fixed at the start of a burst. Buffering is also quite respectable, with 24 JPEG or 19 raw frames recordable before the camera slows down. While this is no match for the ultra-quick Sony RX100 V\u2019s 24fps, given the relatively short lens I don\u2019t think many potential buyers will be terribly concerned. E3-type remote control, USB, and HDMI sockets \nWhen it comes to video, though, Canon has again disappointed any fans hoping that it might finally include 4K recording in an affordable camera. Instead, you only get Full HD at 60fps, and unlike the G7 X Mark II there\u2019s not even a microphone socket for recording better-quality sound. One consolation is that in-camera time-lapse movie creation is available. \nCanon has included comprehensive connectivity options, with onboard Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Dynamic NFC. This should make it really easy to connect the camera wirelessly to a smartphone, tablet, printer or smart TV for copying, printing or viewing your shots. You can also use your smartphone to control the camera remotely, either over Wi-Fi with a live view feed, or as a quick and simple Bluetooth shutter release. I\u2019ve been really impressed by how well this all works on recent Canon cameras. One handy-looking new feature on the G1 X III is the ability to use the Bluetooth connection to connect to the camera, browse through your shots and copy them across to your phone, even when the camera is switched off. Canon G1 X III \u2013 Body and design \nIn terms of design the Mark III represents a complete about-turn for the G1 X series, and I think it\u2019s very much for the better. The body layout is lifted from the 1in-sensor G5 X, which is no bad thing as that camera is very pleasant to shoot with. The central EVF affords a very natural balance, while giving plenty of space on the body for buttons and dials. The end result is an almost DSLR-like handling experience that\u2019s way better than Sony\u2019s cramped RX100-series cameras. \nRelated: Best Canon lenses Turned off, the camera is impressively slim, but the lens cap is chunky \nDespite its small size, the G1 X III feels unexpectedly secure in your hand, thanks to its rubberised fingergrip and pronounced thumb hook. The design also encourages you to support the camera with your left hand under the lens ring, which gives a more stable shooting stance. The key shooting controls are all well-placed too, which isn\u2019t always the case on cameras this small. \nCanon has included an EOS-like command dial for changing exposure settings, placed vertically on the front-plate for operation by your forefinger, along with an exposure compensation dial that falls underneath your thumb. The zoom is controlled by a rocker around the shutter button, but alternatively you can use the dial around the lens. This dial rotates smoothly with no clicks, and can also be used for manual focus. There\u2019s another small, fiddly vertical dial on the back, but this is only really needed in manual-exposure mode. The fully articulated screen makes it easy to shoot at unusual angles \nThe EVF is a 2.36-million-dot OLED unit, placed centrally above the lens. While this design means that the camera is larger than other zoom compacts with built-in EVFs, such as the Panasonic Lumix TZ100 or Sony RX100 V, the advantage is that the viewfinder is larger and clearer. Immediately below is the 1.04-million-dot full-articulated touchscreen, which can be set to point in virtually any direction: up, down, or forwards for selfies. Canon has included its really well-implemented touch interface, including the ability to use the touchscreen to move the focus point with the camera held to your eye. Canon G1 X III \u2013 Accessories \nTo go with the PowerShot G1 X Mark III, Canon has announced some additional matched accessories. First up is the \u00a349.99 LH-DC110 lens hood, which attaches to the lens without interfering with its retraction into the body. Canon G1 X III with LH-DC110 lens hood (left) and WP-DC56 underwater housing (right) \nSecond is the WP-DC56 underwater housing, which is waterproof to a depth of 40m (130ft) while still giving full access to all of the camera\u2019s extensive external controls. It\u2019s the only such housing Canon makes for an APS-C-sensor camera, and will cost \u00a3429.99. Like the camera itself, both are due to go sale in November. \nRelated: Best compact cameras Opening impressions \nWith the PowerShot G1 X Mark III, Canon has managed a really impressive technological feat \u2013 it\u2019s barely believable that such a small body can accommodate an APS-C sensor and a zoom lens. What\u2019s more, from my short time with it so far it appears to be a very usable camera indeed, with excellent handling and rapid autofocus. It\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s nothing else quite like it on the market. Canon\u2019s new G1 X III is styled like a miniature SLR \nIf there\u2019s one serious catch, it\u2019s the relatively limited lens range; I\u2019m not sure how many photographers will be attracted a 3x zoom with a relatively modest maximum aperture, especially given the \u00a31150 price tag. Indeed for less money you could buy an EOS M5 with its 15-45mm kit zoom and the option of changing lenses, albeit in a rather larger package. But if you want a pocket camera with a short zoom lens and the highest possible image quality, the G1 X III certainly looks like it\u2019ll be a leading contender when it hits the shops in November.

The big reveal came courtesy of Greg McKelvey, Chief Strategy Officer at Fossil Group, who was speaking during the opening keynote of the annual Qualcomm 5G Summit in Hong Kong. \nSpeaking to press \u2013 including Trusted Reviews \u2013 and key industry players, McKelvey said: \u201c15% of our business is wearables. In the next three to four years, half of our business will have connectivity. We\u2019re just getting started, we\u2019re scaling it significantly. The next generations, we\u2019re going to start getting cellular and connected.\u201d \nMcKelvey also added that Fossil was looking at ways to bring \u201ccellular [connectivity] to our back catalogue as well\u201d. \nThis is big news for fans of smartwatches and fitness trackers. Fossil is a major player in the watch industry, producing 50 million watches and accessories per year and holding a third-place share of the entire global traditional watch market. \nThe company\u2019s core brands include Fossil and the recently acquired Misfit, but Fossil Group also makes licensed accessories for brands like Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs, Emporio Armani, Burberry, Kate Spade New York, Diesel, DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, and Adidas. \nWe\u2019ve already seen smartwatches from Michael Kors, for instance. In fact, Fossil Group currently has 14 brands across smartwatches, hybrid smartwatches, and trackers. \nMcKelvey was speaking during the 5G Summit keynote, which is hosted by US chipmaker Qualcomm. The conference\u2019s main focus is 5G, but there was plenty of focus on connected devices. Qualcomm is a major player in this sector; in fact, Cristiano Amon, EVP of Qualcomm Technologies, revealed that the company has \u201c1.5 billion [connected] devices that have already shipped using Qualcomm technologies\u201d during the event. \nAmon added: \u201cI do believe the best years of the wireless industry are still ahead of us.\u201d \nHave you joined the wearable revolution yet?

Now, six months on from April\u2019s Creators Update, comes the next OS refresh: the Fall Creators Update. \nRather than make sweeping changes to the OS, Microsoft has taken the opportunity to focus on its Mixed Reality platform, with only minor tweaks to the rest of the OS. How to download the Fall Creators Update when it goes live \nBefore I start this review, here\u2019s how to download the update before Microsoft rolls it out to your PC. \nSimply head to the Windows 10 Media Creation tool page on Microsoft\u2019s website. You should see a grey bar that states \u201cWe noticed you are running Windows 10. If you would like to update to the latest version, click Update now.\u201d The update will likely be available this afternoon UK time, so we\u2019d advise waiting \u2019til then. \nClick on the \u2018Update Now\u2019 button and follow the steps in the window that opens, and that should do the trick. The download will run in the background and will then ask you to restart to finalise the installation. \nThere are fewer risks involved with downloading the update this way compared to signing up to the Insider scheme that Microsoft runs for Windows 10, but it\u2019s always worth making a failsafe recovery backup of Windows if you have stuff you don\u2019t want to lose. Search for \u2018recovery\u2019 in the Start Menu to get one set up before you download the Creators Update. \nNow, on with the review: Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \u2013 Mixed Reality \nMixed Reality is the main focus of the Fall Creators Update, with changes running through several applications. As the name suggests, the technology is about overlaying the virtual onto the real world, in the same vein as the HoloLens. \nIn practice, Mixed Reality doesn\u2019t quite live up to that promise, with the majority of experiences actually pure virtual reality (VR). In fact, the main true mixed-reality experience comes in Paint 3D and the new Mixed Reality Viewer app. \nThis application was introduced in the Creators Update, but the Fall version of the app now works with devices that have a camera \u2013 the Surface Pro , for example. Models you generate or download in the app can be projected and placed into the real world via the Mixed Reality app. As you move your device around, you can move around the model and view it from different angles. It\u2019s neat to watch, but isn\u2019t anything that we haven\u2019t seen before on various other devices and smartphones, with Pok\u00e9mon Go a good example. \nA bigger change comes from the Mixed Reality Portal, which would better be described as the virtual reality portal. This app is designed to work with the Mixed Reality headsets, which are really virtual reality headsets. Microsoft\u2019s naming convention is certainly a little confusing at the moment.

As well as serving as an app launcher, Cliff House lets you view your Windows desktop, create a virtual cinema experience and view other types of media. \nOf course, gaming is one of the key uses for Mixed Reality headsets, controlled via the wireless controllers (one for each hand). The few demos that I\u2019ve tried have been neat, delivering an immersive experience, but I\u2019ll hold off on a final judgement until Trusted Reviews has the opportunity to put some of the headsets through their paces. I won\u2019t go into more detail on the Mixed Reality Portal, as Trusted has covered the technology and has explained all of the headsets and experiences already. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \u2013 Fluent Design \nMicrosoft is using the Fall Creators Update to debut its Fluent Design. Don\u2019t expect to see huge changes to the way that Windows looks; Fluent Design is rather subtle. For example, you can see the \u2018Acrylic\u2019 effect in the Start menu, where a subtle transparency replaces the solid design of the original. With Fluent Design, scroll bars disappear when you move your cursor away from them, shrinking out of view. \nThe changes are difficult to spot, but they make Windows 10 feel like a more modern and sleek operating system. And the impact should become greater, as developers start using the same design language. That is if you actually download and use Windows 10 Store apps. \nFor anyone that wants to resize the Start menu, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that options are available diagonally, as well as vertically and horizontally. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \u2013 Photos Remix \nThe Photos app sees a big overhaul; it\u2019s now called Photos Remix. This update adds some features that you\u2019re probably familiar with from Google Photos or macOS Photos. Photos will now automatically scan your images so that you can search for objects. \nA search for \u2018cat\u2019 didn\u2019t produce the expected results, with Photos displaying a couple of pictures of a hippo, two of an owl, a couple of a fox, and one of a monkey \u2013 all at the top of the list. It also found some pictures of cats, which was nice. \nGoogle Photos, running with the same set of images, was more accurate in its search. Although it picked up a picture of a hippo and a monkey, these sat alomgide a wider mix of cat photos. Google Photos is also smarter, so you can filter by type, such as \u2018black cat\u2019; Photos Remix didn\u2019t find anything when using the same term. \nBasic photo editing is built into Photos, letting you apply filters, adjust the colour and brightness, spot-fix errors, remove red-eye, and adjust and crop an image. These simple tools are fine for light photo editors, but don\u2019t match the more detailed controls available with macOS Photos. Serious photographers will need to rely on other software for editing. \nWith the new Creations feature, Photos Remix can automatically edit photos and videos together for you, overlaying music. The software will add motion and zoom to photos automatically, too. If you don\u2019t like the results, you can just hit the \u2018Remix it for me\u2019 button and Photos will have another go. Alternatively, you can edit it all manually, controlling motion, display time and music choice. Creations is a fun feature that offers a good way to put photos together in a slick slideshow. \nTying in with the 3D film, you can overlay 3D effects to video files \u2013 say, adding in a blizzard or the odd explosion. It\u2019s fun, but far from an essential feature. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \u2013 People Bar \nPeople Bar is a new utility that sits to the left of the Notification Area. It\u2019s designed to provide quick access to your contacts, and you can even pin your main ones to the taskbar. \nFrom a contact, you can launch into an email (provided you use the built-in Mail client) or take part in a Skype conversation. It\u2019s a shame there\u2019s no integration with Cortana\u2019s ability to send SMS messages via your Android phone, though. \nI found that the People Bar felt like a clunky third-party add-on; it isn\u2019t the kind of feature I\u2019d often use, if at all. You might find it more useful if you frequently use the built-in Mail app and Skype. Fortunately, you can turn off People Bar in Settings if you don\u2019t want to use it. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \u2013 OneDrive \nOneDrive used to have a brilliant feature called Placeholders, where it was possible to view all of your files, but only some were downloaded on-demand. That feature is back with the Fall Creators Update, and it\u2019s called Files on Demand. It saves disk space by not downloading everything. You can, of course, mark the files that you want for permanent offline use. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \u2013 Android linking \nYou can link your Android phone or iPhone to your Windows 10 PC so you can share data between them. To do this, you need to have the Microsoft apps installed for Android. \nThere\u2019s currently only one feature implemented: Continue on PC. From a web browser on your Android phone, select the Share option and tap the \u2018Continue on PC\u2019 icon to send the website to your computer. You can also do the same in the Cortana app with news stories. Anything sent to your computer will appear immediately, or will be delivered to the Action Center, so you can deal with it later. Annoyingly, Windows 10 opens sent links in Edge, and there\u2019s no way to change this, even if you\u2019ve opted for a different default browser. In addition, there\u2019s no way to reverse the process, so you can\u2019t send items from your PC to your phone. \nThis feature is a step in the right direction, but it doesn\u2019t go far enough and feels a little limited. It\u2019s also a shame that some other features that Microsoft had touted for the Fall Creators Update haven\u2019t been included. There\u2019s currently no option to receive incoming call alerts on Android (you only get missed call alerts), plus there\u2019s no Timeline feature , which would let you pick up where you left off, moving seamlessly between PC and Android or iOS. This feature has been pushed back, so we may not see it until 2018 now. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \u2013 Edge \nEdge\u2019s updates are minor. Better PDF and EPUB handling are the standout options, including the ability to use Ink directly via Edge. There\u2019s nothing to really grab the attention here, and as such Chrome remains the superior browser in my opinion. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \u2013 Cortana \nCortana, too, benefits from only minor tweaks. You can now use your voice to lock your PC, shut down or restart. These commands aren\u2019t that useful, and I find it far easier to use the lock shortcut (Windows+L), and the standard shutdown/restart controls. \nMore usefully, Cortana\u2019s settings have been moved into the Settings app, where they should have been from the start. This provides a more consistent interface and makes it easier to find various settings. \nCortana now has pop-outs that can display more information on a query, such as web results. This is a neat way of drilling down to get more information \u2013 but it\u2019s a shame that you\u2019re still limited to using Bing, and that search results open in Edge. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \u2013 Settings and update \nThe Settings app continues to evolve, and more options are being ported over from the old Control Panel. Now, the About setting is cleaner and easier to understand, providing an overview of your PC\u2019s health, the option to change your computer\u2019s name, and general specs. \nOne annoying change is the default apps option, which is now the only way to change how certain file types are opened. In previous versions of Windows 10, the Control Panel version of default apps let you select a program and choose, with one click, to give it all of its default options. It was a great way to override some of Windows 10\u2019s more annoying habits, such as opening PDFs in Edge. \nWith the Fall Creators Update, you can\u2019t just give an app all of its defaults with one click. Instead, you have to choose each option manually. This feels like a step backwards. Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \u2013 Windows Update \nWindows Update now displays information on individual updates, so you can see the current status and anything that you might need to do, such as restarting your computer. \nMicrosoft also gives you control over the bandwidth that updates use \u2013 you can manually set the bandwidth at which items are downloaded. And if you have PC set up to share downloads with other internet users, you can set a bandwidth and monthly upload limit, too. This is handy if you\u2019re on a metered connection, or don\u2019t want your bandwidth to be hogged by updates. Should I install the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update? \nThe Fall Creators Update is so focused on delivering Mixed Reality that the other changes feel comparatively minor. Yet, they\u2019re important steps as Windows 10 matures and evolves. \nUltimately, this isn\u2019t an update that Home users can skip. Microsoft sees the Fall Creators Update as a continuation of the Windows 10 experience, and as such, you\u2019ll need to update to it at some point in the future if you want to receive the latest security patches. \nUnless you\u2019re going to rush out and buy a Mixed Reality headset, there\u2019s no compelling reason upgrade on day one.

The reason, sadly car fans, is that it\u2019s in its original state and thus its value is higher, with the people who can afford such a car looking at it as an investment or as a work of automotive art to put in their collection. \nThis might seem a shame, but at least is keeps the car safe and sound; there are the occasional reports of people crashing ultra-rare supercars like the Ferrari F40, essentially wiping out a piece of automotive history in the process. \nThe seller, classic supercar dealer Tom Hartley Jnr , has not listed the price of this mint-condition F1, though we expect it will fetch millions upon millions of pounds. Even so there may be one determined buyer that will take the covers of the car and give its 6.1 litre V12 a chance to roar once more on the open road, and allow less well-heeled car fans a glimpse of one of the finest supercars ever made. \nIf you had to pick your ultimate supercar, what would it be?

As such, the wearable world is wondering what\u2019s coming out of Qualcomm HQ next? \nAlthough the company \u201cisn\u2019t ready to announce\u201d a new chip just yet, Qualcomm confirmed a number of details about the next-gen chip \u2013 likely coming this year or next \u2013 at its annual 5G Summit in Hong Kong, attended by Trusted Reviews . \n\u201cWe are working on the next generation,\u201d said Pankaj Kedia, Senior Director of Product Management at Qualcomm. \u201cThe power [consumption] will be lower. The size will be smaller. The sensors will be smarter. Connectivity will be more seamless. More options. And of course security that you expect.\u201d \nHe added that it \u201conly gets better from here\u201d, and noted that Qualcomm believes smartwatch battery life is one of the biggest challenges right now. Kedia declined to go into specifics, but suggested that Qualcomm was working on a chip-based solution to improve battery life. \n\u201cYou want to reduce power consumption,\u201d he explained to press. \u201cWe are doing so at the chip level, at the platform level. So using the chipset to intelligently turn off things you\u2019re not using, right? There\u2019s a lot of action there.\u201d \nHe also said that Qualcomm was \u201cencouraging the ecosystem to come out with new chemistries\u201d in terms of improving actual battery technology, and added that Qualcomm was continuing its efforts on quick charging to reduce the burden of a poor battery life on user experience. \n\u201cThere is no one silver bullet,\u201d said Kedia. \u201cWe continue to chug along; this is not an overnight thing. We are in wearables for the long haul. We are just getting started.\u201d \nThe bad news is that even if Qualcomm can reduce power consumption at a chip level, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your smartwatch will have battery life. Jim Merrick, Marketing Director of the Internet of Things at Qualcomm, detailed how manufacturers are often trying to reduce physical device size, which puts limits on overall battery life potential. \n\u201cWe\u2019re all aware of the limitations of battery life,\u201d said Merrick. \u201cAs we become more power-efficient, we\u2019re at odds with the fashionable design. There\u2019s also that desire from consumers, and certainly from the fashion houses, to create thinner and thinner devices.\u201d \nHe added: \u201cEven as we advance our power efficiency, we\u2019re going to be facing that battle continuously.

While LG has been making progress with the development of flexible displays over the past few years, a partnership with the company would see Apple shift from parting with huge amounts of cash to buy displays from Samsung, one of its main rivals in the smartphone world. \nSamsung currently has a monopoly on OLED displays for smartphones, so if Apple were to stop buying its display for its iPhone X , then Samsung could see a large dent in its customer base. But Samsung has also been working on foldable displays, so if it makes any significant developments in the near future it could potentially attract back Apple, if indeed Cupertino is planning on ditching Samsung displays, \nHowever, this is all speculation based on rumours, and despite some of the developments with foldable displays and other tech, such as 3D displays in phones, even the more innovative mobiles like the Galaxy S8 with its Infinity Display and the machine-learning loaded Google Pixel 2 , still retain very familiar rigid handset designs. \nSo perhaps 2020 is a little ambitious to expect a bevy of flexible mobiles to crop up, particularly as such new tech often requires new standards to ensure apps and software work nicely with unusual displays? Take HDR, for example, which has two competing standards, meaning the mobiles that have adopted the tech end up with different ways to display high dynamic range content. All of which is a tad confusing for consumers. \nThen again, every year is the year we\u2019re finally going to see the foldable Samsung Galaxy X \u2026 \nWould you want a foldable iPhone or does it sound like a gimmick?

But the Motion is a flagship BlackBerry phone rather than a lower-end handset designed to offer BlackBerry secure software services rather than set showcase its hardware design. \nHowever, BlackBerry, in conjunction with its phone making partner TCL, appear to have decided its time to shed some of the BlackBerry brand\u2019s traditions with the Motion, which is available for pre-order today from the Carphone Warehouse; the likes of Currys, John Lewis and Amazon are set to stock the handset from November. \nFor \u00a3399, the Motion is offering Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 625 chipset, 4GB of RAM, and a 5.5-inch full HD display.

Going to need more than 140 characters to go over \ud83c\udf4e's Project Titan. I call it \"The Thing\" pic.twitter.com/sLDJd7iYSa \n\u2014 MacCallister Higgins (@macjshiggins) October 17, 2017 \nThis is significant given reports suggesting Apple is building a system that can be added to existing vehicles, rather than its own self-driving car. \nOther roof systems we\u2019ve seen are smaller, but crucial parts of the computational systems are stored elsewhere in the vehicle. \n\u201cThe majority of the compute stack is likely located inside the roof unit,\u201d Higgins added in a follow up tweet, while also confirming the array features a total of six LiDAR units. In the know \nVoyage itself is a self-driving car company so Higgins obviously knows what he\u2019s talking about here. \nJudging by this short clip it appears as if adding Apple\u2019s Project Titan array to your car would be as simple as installing a roof rack. \nShould Apple bring Project Titan to market in this guise, the plug-and-play solution might be the simplest and most affordable way for drivers to embrace the autonomous era. \nLast year a Bloomberg report claimed Apple had scaled back its self-driving car ambitions in favour of developing a system that could simply be sold to existing manufacturers. \nIs Apple\u2019s vision for autonomous cars the way most drivers will get involved? Or is a complete care solution still preferable? Drop us a line @TrustedReviews with your thoughts.

And once the malware was on a device, it used encryption to obscure its code and avoid basic-levels of detection. \nWith this in mind, Symantec advises the evergreen practise of keeping your mobile software up-to-date, avoiding apps from unknown sources, paying close attention to the permissions an app wants, and of course use mobile security services. \nHave you encountered any game-based malware?

It\u2019s not the most elegant solution, but it\u2019s a solution nonetheless. Still no Bluetooth audio \nOne of the most disappointing things about the Switch console continues to be Nintendo\u2019s lack of support for Bluetooth headphones. \nWhile this addition goes some of the way to resolving the issue, a far greater number of folks have Bluetooth headphones than wireless USB headsets. \nConsidering it\u2019s the way Joy-Cons connect to the console, there\u2019s no real reason Nintendo can\u2019t enable audio over Bluetooth. \nPerhaps it\u2019ll arrive in an update over time? \nElsewhere in the Switch OS 4.0.0 update, Nintendo added the ability to record 30 seconds of gameplay video and make it available for sharing on Facebook and Twitter. \nCurrently the feature is limited to four Nintendo-made games: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, ARMS, Splatoon 2, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. \nThere\u2019s also the option to transfer saved game files between Switch consoles for those with multiple devices. \nShare your thoughts on the latest Nintendo Switch update by tweeting us @TrustedReviews.

If you have an iPhone 8 256GB the overcharging could be as much as \u00a346 per month, according to Citizen\u2019s Advice. \nThe consumer group\u2019s CEO Gillian Guy said (via The Register ): \u201cGillian Guy, chief exec of the consumer charity, said: \u201cIt is clearly unfair that some phone providers are charging loyal customers for handsets that they have already paid for. It\u2019s especially concerning that older customers are more likely to be stung by this sharp practice.\u201d Are networks doing enough? \nAccording to the report, the over 65s are most likely to fall victim to the overcharging practices. \nIn response to the report, EE said it updated customers regularly about their options at the end of their contracts. \nA spokesperson said: \u201cWe send our customers regular updates about their options before and after they reach the end of their contract, and the vast majority of our customers upgrade to a new phone or move to a SIM-only plan near the end of their contract.\u201d \nRelated: Best Android phones \nVodafone echoed the sentiment by claiming: \u201cWherever possible, we contact our customers nearing the end of their contract to offer them a range of options.\u201d \nMeanwhile Three suggested the onus was on the customer to change their plans because they\u2019re informed of the date the contract ends when signing up. \nA spokesperson said: \u201cWe appreciate any feedback to help us improve our processes and are exploring new ways to ensure our customers can get the most out of their mobile phones at a competitive price.\u201d \nO2, the only major network not singled out by the Citizens Advice report claimed its rivals were undermining trust in the industry. \nA network spokesperson added: \u201cForcing customers to continue to pay for a phone they already own not only hits their pockets but undermines trust and the reputation of the industry.\u201d It added: \u201cWe\u2019d like to see the other operators review their position and follow our lead.\u201d \nHave you fallen victim to UK networks letting the contracts continue to run after two years are up?

Every so often, Valve\u2019s online video game store Steam will produce mind-bendingly cheap deals on a range of titles, including many AAA offerings. \nBut there\u2019s often very little notice when it comes to Steam Sales, mainly because developers don\u2019t want you hanging around to purchase their games if you know there\u2019s a discount coming up. \nThe good news is that it appears that times and dates for the next three Steam Sale events have been leaked. Gaming news site Kotaku has reportedly confirmed these dates with three developer sources, suggesting that the leak is in fact legitimate. \nSo when will they take place? Apparently, the schedule is as follows: \nSteam Halloween Sale: October 26, 2017 \u2013 November 1, 2017 \nSteam Autumn Sale: November 22, 2017 \u2013 November 28, 2017 \nSteam Winter Sale: December 21, 2017 \u2013 January, 2018 \nThat means the next chance you have to get your hands on some hugely discounted video games is October 26, with deals expected to begin at around 6pm GMT. \nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that Valve hasn\u2019t officially confirmed these sales, so we recommend taking this leak with due caution \u2013 regardless of what developer sources are saying \u2013 for now. \nWe\u2019ll be updating you with more details about future Steam sales, so make sure to check back on Trusted Reviews for the latest. \nHave you managed to bag any great deals in Steam sales gone by?

The website is a hotbed for mobile leaks, although naturally it\u2019s impossible to verify the legitimacy of such leaks. \nIn any case, it\u2019s still interesting to take a look at what could be coming up, so here\u2019s the supposed leak: Credit: Weibo \nThe image depicts the handset from both the front and back, with the pictured phone looking almost identical to the already-available OnePlus 5. \nHowever, there\u2019s a key difference: a slim bezel. On the front of the phone, the Home button has been scrapped \u2013 and presumably replaced by virtual Android navigation buttons. This has made it possibly to significantly increase the amount of space on the front of the phone that\u2019s occupied by screen. \nThis is a design trend that\u2019s becoming increasingly popular, with flagship handsets like the Samsung Galaxy S8 , Samsung Galaxy Note 8 , LG V30 , and iPhone X all having adopted it to date. The OnePlus 5 still uses an older, thick-bezel design, which is one of the main reasons why industry commentators think OnePlus may be toying with the idea of launching a slim-bezel update to its flagship handset. \nOf course, OnePlus hasn\u2019t confirmed any such device, so we\u2019re still in the dark \u2013 at least in terms of official information. As such, take all leaks with a pinch of salt until we hear news directly from OnePlus HQ. \nWhat would you like to see from the next OnePlus smartphone?

The new patent the South Korean tech giant has filed shows a magnetic coil charging pad designed to fill up smartphones and smartwatches without the need for wires. Samsung already offers a wireless charging pad, and its Galaxy handsets have supported charging through magnetic induction for several generations. But the new patent describes a pad with two different takes on magnetic charging; induction and resonance. The former uses more traditional wireless charging techniques which require devices to be placed on a pad or no more than 7mm away from its magnetic coil to fill up on electrical juice. Magnetic resonance charging on the other hand is more advanced and can charge a device from some distance, though we are talking centimetres rather than metres. While induction is considered to be more efficient at charging up a battery, resonance is championed as being more convenient. If Samsung\u2019s patent does bear fruit we could see charging pads that can offer nearby wireless charging to a room, rather than be confined to a single spot. Another feature outlined in the patent is that the charging pad will detect the type of device that needs charging in its proximity and decide which method is best used to fuel the gadget. If work on this charging pad is already well underway and the patent is not merely a speculative UPTO filing, then there\u2019s a chance we could see the Samsung Galaxy S9 , due to make its debut early next year, pop up with a new wireless charging pad in tow. \nWhat features would you like to see in the Galaxy S9?

The new feature, however, lets users deposit money directly into the Steam Wallets of their digital friends. \nBuying and sending a Steam Digital Gift Card is pretty straightforward. Simply head over to Steam\u2019s dedicated Digital Gift Cards page , select an amount and who you want to give it to, and settle up at the virtual till. You can also add a personalised message, but that\u2019s all there is to it. \nAs the funds are added direct to your Steam Wallet, they can be used to purchase anything available on Steam, including games and in-game purchases, hardware, and even stuff from the Steam Community Market. \nHowever, there are a handful of caveats to Steam\u2019s new online gift card scheme. \nFor starters, you can only gift set amounts of loot. In the UK, these are \u00a34, \u00a310, \u00a325, \u00a350 and \u00a3100. Should the lucky recipient live in another country, Steam says it will localise it to the appropriate currency, so some gifts will be subject to economic fluctuations. \nAdditionally, you can only give Digital Gift Cards to people you have been friends with on Steam for at least three days. This isn\u2019t a problem in and of itself, but it does mean that non-Steam users are still tied to physical gift cards. \nLastly, you can\u2019t use funds from your own Steam Wallet to pay for Digital Gift Cards \u2013 not exactly shocking, but still a bit mean. PayPal, Bitcoin, and traditional credit/debit card are the payment methods accepted. \nEnough nitpicking. The move is a very welcome (if slightly overdue) one on Valve\u2019s part \u2013 happy gifting, PC gamers! \nShare your thoughts on Steam Digital Gift Cards by tweeting us @TrustedReviews.

The good news is that some new information has emerged, giving us unprecedented insight into what Microsoft might be cooking up behind closed doors. \nSpecialist blog Windows Central has published a detailed report that suggests Andromeda is actually a new foldable device \u201cwith an emphasis on pen and digital-ink functionality\u201d. The report notes that this device will run on Windows 10 and \u201ccould be here as soon as next year\u201d. \nIt\u2019s technically a tablet device, but sources say it\u2019s \u201cdesigned to be pocketable when folded\u201d, bringing it down to the size of a phone. It\u2019s also tipped to feature telephony capabilities \u2013 like making calls and sending texts \u2013 so you could technically replace your actual smartphone with it. \nBut the report notes: \u201cMy sources make it clear, however, that this is not supposed to be a smartphone replacement, but rather a device similar to the cancelled \u2018Microsoft Courier\u2019. In short, Andromeda is a digital pocket notebook.\u201d \nThe writer goes on: \u201cI\u2019m told the device puts pen and inking at the very forefront of its experience, with some prototypes opening up into a notebook app that\u2019s tied to OneNote,\u201d adding: \u201cThe notebook app itself is designed in a way that mimics writing in a real notebook, with virtual pages that spread across the foldable device.\u201d \nThis Andromeda folding tablet is tipped to become one of the new wave of upcoming devices running on Qualcomm\u2019s powerful Snapdragon processors. The first of these Snapdragon laptops are expected to debut in September. \nA folding phone-cum-tablet is an interesting move from Microsoft, given that the firm has resolutely culled its mobile business only this year. However, the company still appears to be all-in on hybrids, and this is arguably just another take on the 2-in-1s we\u2019ve seen rising in popularity amongst consumers. \nStill, Microsoft hasn\u2019t announced anything officially, so take all of this with due caution for now. \nWhat would you like to see from a future Microsoft hybrid?

In fact, there\u2019s so many we\u2019ve decided to pull together the best of them so you can get your heart-racing and adrenaline pumping this scare season even after your Stranger Things season 2 fix. \nAs well as leading with our choice of the five best horror movies on UK Netflix right now, we\u2019ve chosen some others depending on what you\u2019re after. Top 5 horror films on Netflix UK \nThe Babadook (2014) \nThe Babadook centres around a widow trying to care for her difficult son. Things take a turn when the child believes a monster has come out of a story book. This is one of the creepiest and best horror films to come out in recent years. Its brooding cinematography belies its tiny budget and the performances are excellent all round. \nL et the Right One in (2008)/Let me in (2010) \nLet the Right One In is a Swedish horror film set in the 80s about a troubled young boy who befriends a mysterious young girl with a dark secret. It\u2019s strange, stark and brilliant. \nIf you don\u2019t like watching films with subtitles then try Let Me In . It\u2019s pretty much a shot for shot remake of the Swedish film, but in English. We would recommend the original, though. \nThe Omen (1976) \nThis horror classic still has the ability to scare. A freaky kid, an even freakier nanny and some monstrous dogs all serve to create a great chiller. Whether you\u2019re religious or not, The Omen is a great watch this Halloween. \nYoung Frankenstein (1974) \nThis send up of classic horror movies is a work of genius and one of Mel Brooks\u2019 finest films. Gene Wilder as Dr Frankenstein (it\u2019s pronounced Frankenshteen) plays it straight so the weird and wonderful characters that surround him can shine. If you like being tickled rather than scared, or need a palate cleanser between gory horror, then Young Frankenstein is the film to watch this Halloween. \nThe Cabin in the Woods (2012) \nPenned by Josh Whedon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Avengers fame, The Cabin in the Woods takes reference from dozens of classic horror movies to create something brilliantly unique. Funny, gory, scary and with a plot that will keep you guessing, this is the perfect Halloween film for those who want to be entertained, not scared witless. Best Horror Comedies on Netflix \nZombieland (2009) \nIf there\u2019s one zombie comedy that comes close to matching the brilliance of Shaun of the Dead , it\u2019s Zombieland . A great cast keep the laughs coming and Woody Harrelson is perfect as the Twinkie-obsessed zombie killer. It also has one of the best cameos of all time, we won\u2019t spoil it for you. \nTucker and Dale vs Evil (2010) \nWhat happens when two good-natured american hicks who are fixing up their forest cabin get mistaken for crazed killers? Tucker and Dale vs Evil is the answer, and it\u2019s a damn funny one. A must see if you haven\u2019t already.

Please tick here if you\u2019d prefer not to hear about: Time Inc.'s goods & services, including all the latest news, great deals and offers Third party goods & services Show More \nKiller Klowns from Outer space (1988) \nThere are a lot of clowns. They kill. They\u2019re from outer space. As you\u2019d expect with a title like that, this doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously and is all the better for it. This is no \u2018It\u2019, but I\u2019d still recommend coulrophobics steer well clear. \nIf you\u2019ve seen all the horror comedies and are desperate try these\u2026 \nScouts\u2019 Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse (2015) \u2013 Shaun of the Dead it isn\u2019t, but there are some laddish laughs to be had in this zombie horror, especially if you\u2019ve had a few to drink beforehand. The title pretty much says it all. \nPride Prejudice and Zombies (2016) \u2013 Splicing Jane Austen and a zombie film might sound like madness, but this film is actually based on a bestseller from the author who also brought us Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter . You might like the dialogue if you\u2019re an Austen fan, but this isn\u2019t particularly funny or scary and even lacks the romantic tension that makes the great author\u2019s work so loved in the first place. \nScary Movie 1, 2, 3 \u2013 If you want some brainless horror fun then the first three films from the Scary Movie franchise are available on Netflix. Ok they\u2019re nowhere near the brilliance of Scream , but there are scenes that will have you giggling. Scary they are not, though. Best Creepy Atmospheric Horror Films on Netflix \nCrimson Peak (2015) \nIt may not be one of Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s best, but Crimson Peak is one of the most stunning scary films ever made. Sets, costumes and effects are top notch and the film drips with a rich gothic atmosphere. Don\u2019t expect lots of jump scares, it\u2019s as much a love story as a horror. \nIt Follows (2014) \nThere\u2019s something deeply disturbing about this low-budget independent horror. It Follows focuses on a nineteen-year-old who begins experiencing a strange entity only she can see following her. She tries to escape with her friends, but can\u2019t seem to get free. It sounds like a well-worn setup, but the director keeps you off kilter to make It Follows truly creepy. \nThe Woman in Black (2012) \nDaniel Radcliffe sheds his wizardly robes for Gothic horror that follows a young man trying to uncover the mystery of a killer ghost terrorising a small village. There\u2019s more than a shiver or two to be had and what makes The Woman in Black a rare treat is that it\u2019s certified 12, rather than 15 or 18. Still you wouldn\u2019t want children younger than 12 watching it. \nTale of Tales (2015) \nTale of Tales isn\u2019t really a horror, more a curio. Lavish set design, costumes and a stellar cast lift three interweaved tales into something that\u2019s both grotesque and intriguing. Toby Jones as the King of Highhills and his pet flea need to be seen to be believed. \nUnder the Shadow (2016) \nUnder the Shadow has been hailed by critics and audiences alike for it\u2019s sinister and terrifying atmosphere. Set in war-torn Tehran a mother and her daughter are trapped in their home and beset by danger and evil \u2013 some real and some maybe not. If you don\u2019t have a problem with subtitled films then give this a chance. \nIf you\u2019ve seen them all and are desperate\u2026 \nThe Visit \u2013 M Night Shyamalan has been releasing more misses than hits recently, but The Visit isn\u2019t anywhere near as bad as The Last Airbender or After Earth . The story centres around two teenage siblings who go to visit their grandparents who they haven\u2019t met before. The grandparents behave very oddly and soon the kids start suspecting all isn\u2019t quite right. If you can get over the annoying teens and the shaky homemade-style camera-work it\u2019s creepy and enjoyable. \nSilent Hill \u2013 Movies based on video games tend to be absolutely terrible, Silent Hill isn\u2019t. It\u2019s not great either, but it is able to ramp up the tension thanks to brilliant sets and costumes, unfortunately the plot ends up being a bit garbled. Best gory and jump scare horror movies on Netflix \nGreen Room (2016) \nA bunch of liberal punk-rockers probably shouldn\u2019t play a gig at a neo-Nazi bar. Things go very quickly south when they bear witness to something they shouldn\u2019t, and are trapped in the bar. Tense, creepy and with enough gore this is a perfect Netflix treat for Halloween, even if it lacks any supernatural chills. You\u2019ll also get to see Patrick Stewart as you never have before. \nBone Tomahawk (2015) \nWesterns don\u2019t often work well when spanning genres. Cowboys and Aliens and Jonah Hex are two examples of that. Bone Tomahawk , however, manages to combine the classic Western tropes of redemption and heroism with brutal horror and gore akin to the Hills have Eyes . Some graphic scenes will stay with you forever, but it\u2019s the brilliant character development that keeps you caring about the protagonists that makes this a great horror film. \nThe Descent (2005) \nIf you\u2019re claustrophobic take a deep breath. The Descent is a small British movie about potholers who get trapped in underground caves. First they have to deal with the dangers of falling rocks, but soon they discover that there\u2019s something else in the caves with them, and it\u2019s not friendly. \nChild\u2019s Play (1988) \nA convicted murderer dies and his soul is transferred into the hot-ticket toy of the year. What ensues is both silly and frightening. \nIf you\u2019ve seen them all and are desperate\u2026 \nHostel (2005) \u2013 Arguably the movie that brought the torture porn subgenre of horror to the masses, Hostel needs a strong stomach. Unfortunately the rest of the film feels more like softcore porn than a nail-biting horror. \nHuman Centipede (2009) \u2013 A twisted doctor sews people, mouth to rectum. If that sounds appealing then enjoy. Best Sci-fi Horror on Netflix \nP andorum (2009) \nPandorum was largely overlooked when it was released back in 2009, but it\u2019s worth watch. It doesn\u2019t quite manage to capture the sinister atmosphere of Event Horizon , which it most closely resembles, but it\u2019s a solid sci-fi horror. \nWorld War Z (2013) \nIf you\u2019ve not seen World War Z because of the bad reviews then now might be the time. It\u2019s by no means perfect, and the final third feels like it\u2019s been taken from a totally different movie, but a breathtakingly tense opener and some impressive effects make it worth watching. \nUnder the Skin (2013) \nIf you\u2019re looking for an odd, thoughtful sci-fi horror then look no further than Under the Skin. Starring Scarlett as a mysterious young woman luring men into her white van, it sounds weird. The Scottish setting makes it even odder and the director has chosen to have Johansson interact with the public as well as actors so you\u2019re never quite sure what you\u2019re getting. Certainly not for everyone, this is a film that divides audiences. \nAre we missing any pant-browning corkers?

In an age of constant digital regret, it\u2019s highly advantageous to be able to pull back that awkward 2am text to your ex, or a damning critique of workplace management accidentally sent to your boss. It\u2019s a feature that\u2019s already available on Facebook\u2019s other social media platform, Instagram, with Direct Messages having long supported message-unsending. \nFortunately, WhatsApp has cowed to user demand and is now rolling the feature out. It\u2019s even updated its FAQ page to detail how it will work, ahead of the full rollout. \n\u201cDeleting messages for everyone allows you to delete messages you have sent to either a group or an individual chat,\u201d a WhatsApp note explains. \u201cThis is particularly useful if you sent a message to the wrong chat, or if the message you sent contains a mistake.\u201d \nAccording to WhatsApp, hitting delete will replace the message you sent with the following text: \u201cThis message was deleted.\u201d That means if you do drunk-text someone, they\u2019ll still be aware of your late-night social faux pas , but they just won\u2019t see the contents of your message. \nTo delete a message, follow these steps: Open WhatsApp Navigate to the chat with the offending message Tap and hold the message Choose Delete from the menu Optionally, select multiple messages to delete several items at once Tap Delete > Delete for Everyone \nNaturally, there are a few caveats. Firstly, you can only delete messages for up to seven minutes after sending. Once that time window has passed, you\u2019ll be stuck \u2013 so make up your mind quickly. \nSecondly, you\u2019ll need to ensure that both you and your recipient(s) are using the latest version of WhatsApp, whether it be on Android, iPhone or Windows Phone. If they\u2019re not up to date, the feature won\u2019t be supported. You\u2019ll be notified if deleting for everyone wasn\u2019t successful. \nAnd of course, it\u2019s always entirely possible that the person(s) who you messaged will still see your message before you get a chance to delete it. A pop-up notification could scupper your plans entirely. \nIt\u2019s expected that this new feature will become available to all users globally in the near future. \nWhat do you think of this new feature?

Its \u201cvintage and obsolete products\u201d list is home to an increasingly large roster of devices that will no longer receive hardware service. \nThe next addition to that list is tipped by MacRumours to be the third-generation iPad. The specialist tech site has reportedly seen an internal memo distributed to Apple Authorised Service Providers. In the memo, Apple explains that both Wi-Fi and cellular models of the third-generation iPad will be classified as obsolete around the world \u2013 except for in California and Turkey, for legal reasons. \nThis means Apple and Apple Authorised Service Providers are no longer obligated to repair or service the tablet, because it\u2019s been five years since the product was last manufactured. \nThe third-generation iPad was launched way back in March 2012, and was formally known as \u201cthe new iPad\u201d \u2013 or colloquially as the iPad 3 . With the device, Apple introduced a Retina display, the then-new Apple A5X chip, and a 5-megapixel camera. It ran on the now-ancient iOS 5.1 software, and was eventually discounted in October 2012. \nWe gave the iPad 3 a respectable 4/5 score in our review, praising the tablet\u2019s stunning screen, powerful graphics, good battery life, excellent build quality, and decent value for money. Our verdict was very positive, but we settled on the conclusion that is was \u201can evolutionary rather than revolutionary product\u201d. \nApple has not yet confirmed that the iPad 3 will shortly become obsolete, but the change is expected to go live on October 31, 2017. \nDid you ever jump on the Apple iPad bandwagon?

By shifting the fingerprint scanner to the back of the phone, Samsung was able to flood the front of its handsets with screen, a space-age design that it calls \u2018Infinity Display\u2019. But users have largely bemoaning the rear-set fingerprint scanner, prompting Samsung to seek a solution. \nFortunately, we\u2019ve glimpsed the future already. Samsung has filed for a patent with KIPRIS (South Korea\u2019s intellectual property body) that details an in-screen fingerprint reader. The pressure sensitive scanner would be hidden below the display, making it possible to retain the Infinity Display while returning the fingerprint sensor to the front of the phone. \nThe bad news is that a patent is no guarantee of a technology actually rolling out. For instance, yesterday we reported on a leak from a renowned tipster that suggested the Galaxy S9 won\u2019t feature this sort of technology: 100% sure, Galaxy S9 no screen fingerprint recognition \n\u2014 Ice universe (@UniverseIce) October 26, 2017 \nAnd we recently saw a tweet from a former Samsung marketing manager who also suggested that the technology won\u2019t be ready for the Galaxy S9: Tech probably won't be ready for retail by then \n\u2014 Third Degree Berne (@philipberne) October 3, 2017 \nWhat\u2019s more promising is the idea that the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 will feature this technology instead. The Note 9 will need some way to differentiate itself from the Galaxy S9, and Note phones are often used to trial quirky new technologies before being adopted on the core S-series devices. However, this does leave the question over what we\u2019ll actually see from the Galaxy S9 unanswered. \nIn any case, Samsung hasn\u2019t confirmed either of those phones, so take all rumours, leaks, and speculation with due caution for now. \nWhat would you like to see from next year\u2019s roster of top-tier Samsung Galaxy smartphones?

The latest such leak suggests that Samsung\u2019s next phone won\u2019t feature a headphone jack. \nIt is expected that Samsung will launch its usual flagship duo in March/April, as per tradition. According to the leaks we\u2019ve already seen, the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ will feature more secure facial recognition, made possible by 3D mapping technology. This is similar to Apple\u2019s recently announced Face ID system, which launched on the new iPhone X . \nA more recent leak states that the S9 devices will follow the new trend that the iPhones and Pixel devices have picked up on: no headphone jack. While this is not really an issue due to an adapter dongle being provided with such phones \u2013 as well as the increasing availability of Bluetooth headphones \u2013 many users still seem upset about the feature disappearing. \nThe rumoured Galaxy S9 devices look set to feature the same slim-bezel design that we\u2019ve seen on the S8 and Note 8 devices this year. In addition, Samsung is apparently working on embedding a fingerprint sensor under the glass display. However, this was rumoured to be featured on the iPhone X and never appeared, suggesting that this type of technology may still be a while off. \nFinally, leaked schematics say that the new devices will feature a dual 16 MP rear camera \u2013 similar to on the Note 8 \u2013 and a dual 12-megapixel front-facing camera, possibly for the 3D mapping used in facial recognition. It is likely that the dual rear camera will feature a telephoto lens (also seen on the Note 8), and the dual front camera could be used for high-quality depth-sensing. \nHeadphone jack or no headphone jack, the Galaxy S9 devices will probably set the bar for 2018 phones like the S8 phones did this year. \nAre you happy about the Galaxy S9 possibly not having a headphone jack?

Should a plugin deemed troublesome be discovered, users are served a message on their so-called Kodi box that warns of \u201cunauthorised repositories\u201d and \u201charmuful addons.\u201d \nThe badgering is understood to persist until the highlighted addons are disabled by the end user. \nWhich all sounds proper annoying, but can hardly be deemed underhand if a user knowingly installs the Caretaker plugin. \nNo, the real issue lies in the fact that two Kodi developers have apparently taken to bundling Caretaker with recent skin updates, thereby installing the snoopy software on users\u2019 devices without their approval. \nThe offending Caretaker addon is said to be appearing as part of recent updates to the Estuary MOD V2 and Embuary skins, which are developed by Guilouz and sualfred, respectively. \nTVAddons contends that the packaging of malicious \u2018spyware\u2019 with the skin updates represents a \u201cdependency\u201d for their developers \u2013 and also a further attack on the wider Kodi community. \nRelated: Best VPNs \nIts team writes: \n\u201cThis means that anyone using those skins would automatically have the KN Addon Caretaker installed onto their Kodi box. Understandably, end users are outraged. Some are even calling it spyware! At least one official team Kodi member also spoke out against the move. Both skin developers defended their actions with one term: self-protection. We\u2019re not sure who these guys are trying to protect, because end users wouldn\u2019t have unofficial addons installed unless they wanted them.\u201d \n\nKodi users wanting to ensure they aren\u2019t unwittingly running the KN Addon Caretaker \u2018spyware\u2019 are best advised to uninstall the Estuary MOD V2 and Embuary skins. \nOf course, TVAddons arguably has an axe to grind here, as the popular repository recently found itself targeted by Kodi on Twitter for \u201cbringing nothing but misery to everyone\u201d by failing to act against piracy-enabling addons. \nStill, we reckon Kodi users deserve to know what\u2019s being installed on their streaming devices, don\u2019t you?

Get Ready for Round 3 \ud83d\udc4a #EAUFC3 \nSee the full reveal November 3, 2017. \n\u2014 Electronic Arts (@EA) November 1, 2017 \nWe\u2019ll be covering the full reveal once it goes live, but until then, Trusted Reviews has wish list of five things we\u2019re desperate to see from the next round of mixed martial arts action. \nRelated: Call of Duty: WW2 Give us the weigh ins \nOne of the greatest parts about fight weekend \u2013 apart from the fight itself \u2013 is of course the weigh in. A rabid crowd providing an incredible noise as their favourite combatants step up to see if they\u2019ve made weight the day before the big fight, the excitement in the room is amazing. \nFighters are of course flooded with adrenaline and its an occasion unlike any other. Much like how FIFA lets us watch cup celebrations and F1 2017 has the podium celebrations, EA should let us take part in the pageantry of a weigh in. \nIt\u2019d be great if we could also engage in a bit of pre-fight pushing and shoving in the face off, via a quick-time event (QTE), to further build hype for the fight, perhaps it boosts ticket sales and pay-per-view buys for the event which in turn earns your fighter greater pay in career mode. Fighters have built entire careers on being entertainers, just look at the fact we had Conor McGregor vs Floyd Mayweather as proof. Giving our career fighters a big injection of personality will make the mode significantly better. \nRelated: Xbox One X More entertaining training modes \nTraining for a fight in the Octagon is one of the toughest things any person can ever do. It\u2019s gruelling, intense, and requires incredible mental and physical strength for a competitor to survive any training camp. The drills themselves can also be pretty boring, lifting the same heavy thing over and again, running laps until you can\u2019t breath and eating a crappy diet to make weight. \nThis is a video game of the sport we know and love, and as much as we appreciate the realism that translates in the cage, it is, ultimately, a game. Because of that, the experience still needs to be fun, so it\u2019d be nice if the training drills added a bit of fun to the long stints in career mode. \nI\u2019m not asking EA to discredit the hard work fighters put into training \u2013 we\u2019re not expecting Mighty Mouse to start battering a car or Cris Cyborg to Test Her Might \u2013 but the mechanics could at least keep things varied a little.

EA Sports UFC is as fun to watch as it is to play, as a knockout can land at any moment, so I could see myself watching a few fights and acting as a judge. No more special guest DLC fighters \nThe UFC brand owns an extensive back-catalogue of amazing mixed martial arts companies, boasting hundreds, if not thousands of fighters which could feature in legacy modes. I\u2019d much prefer a K-1 or Pride mode rather than see the likes of Mike Tyson and Bruce Lee feature in the game as paid DLC or pre-order bonuses. \nRelated: Forza Motorsport 7 K-1, Strikeforce, Pride, I want it all! \nThe UFC\u2019s amazing back-catalogue of promotions could also be used to relive some of the greatest fights from these promotions in a UFC Ultimate Legacy Mode. \nGames such as WWE 2K do an amazing job letting us replay some of the greatest matches in history, and EA Sports UFC 3 should be no different. \nGetting the chance to play out awesome fights like Don Frye vs Takayama from Pride or Pettis vs Henderson in Strikeforce\u2019s final PPV would be an interesting package.
