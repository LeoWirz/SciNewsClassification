Chompoo Suriyo/Shutterstock It's Official: Anti-Vaxxers Most Likely to Blame For Rise in Measles \u0ca0_\u0ca0 4 OCT 2017 There is a growing body of evidence that failing to vaccinate children is actively harmful. And according to the most recent study, an increasing number of measles outbreaks is linked to people leaving themselves or their children unvaccinated against the viral infection. \nA team of researchers studied 1,789 cases of measles in the US between 2001 and 2015, and found that the number of outbreaks is increasing - and of those who contracted the illness, nearly 70 percent were unvaccinated. \nThe anti-vaccination movement has been growing in recent years, partially thanks to a dishonest 1998 study by since discredited former physician Andrew Wakefield, who was struck off the UK medical register for misconduct. \nWakefield's study used deliberately falsified results to make the fraudulent claim that there was a link between vaccines and autism. \nAlthough subsequent research has found that there is absolutely no link between vaccines and autism , never mind a causal one, many still believe it and refuse to vaccinate their children, including the important measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR vaccine. \nThanks to this vaccine, researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say, endemic - that is, constantly present - measles has been eliminated from the US. \nHowever, cases are still being imported from outside the US, and it's from these that outbreaks start. \nThe 1,789 cases of measles in US residents examined by the CDC team were all the documented cases for the time period. Incidence of measles is relatively low in the US compared to the worldwide rate of 40 cases per million people annually . \nHowever, it definitely grew in the US over time, from 0.28 cases per million people in 2001 doubling to 0.56 cases per million in 2015. \nOf 2,012 cases overall - including those reported by visitors to the US - only 535 were imported. That leaves 1,477 cases of measles that were contracted within the country. \nAnd for cases contracted by US residents, 1,243 were unvaccinated. That's a massive percentage - 69.5 percent. A further 17.75 percent had unknown vaccination status. \nThe illness is a serious one , and the most vulnerable segment of the population are unvaccinated infants and toddlers, who are at a higher risk of fatal complications. The researchers found that the incidence of measles does decline with age, which highlights the importance of protecting small children. \nAlthough the study did have a limitation based on the inability to verify vaccination information for the adult cases, it's not the first time that failure to vaccinate has been linked with measles outbreaks . \nMoreover, previous modelling suggests that failure to vaccinate can have negative effects on the broader community , which doesn't just mean outbreaks - it also means increased load on hospitals. \nAlthough vaccinated people can contract measles, the CDC's research suggests that vaccination drastically lowers the risk. \n\"The declining incidence with age, the high proportion of unvaccinated cases, and the decline in the proportion of vaccinated cases despite rate increases suggest that failure to vaccinate, rather than failure of vaccine performance, may be the main driver of measles transmission, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high vaccine coverage,\" the researchers wrote in their paper. \nThe research has been published in The JAMA Network .

We also regret the wider, negative impact that this work had on the field of regenerative medicine research.\" \nSeifalian, who was dismissed from UCL in 2016 due to an unrelated matter, has said he was unaware of the unauthorised operations until they had been conducted. \n\"The implantation was the job of the surgeon, who requires getting ethical approval and [regulatory] approval. This was not my job,\" he told Helen Thomson at New Scientist . \n\"We see, time and time again, research scientists being made scapegoats for systemic problems. I am extremely proud of the excellent, innovative work we did at UCL and we continue to build on this to address global health challenges in a responsible and ethical manner.\" \nWhile it remains unclear whether UCL could be legally liable for any of the authorised implants, the inquiry is just the latest instalment chronicling the bizarre rise and fall of Macchiarini. \nThe surgeon became prominent in 2008 on the back of his supposed breakthroughs in regenerative medicine, before becoming embroiled in repeated scandals as seven of his eight patients who received synthetic trachea transplants died. \nAway from science his private life also made headlines, with a much publicised feature in Vanity Fair characterising the researcher as an attention-seeking con man and scammer who claimed to his fianc\u00e9 that the Pope would officiate at their upcoming wedding (he was, in fact, already married). \nAmidst all the drama \u2013 and several retractions of his papers \u2013 Macchiarini lost his professional and academic postings at UCL, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, and most recently, the Russian Science Foundation. \nAs for how the surgeon got away with so much, one former colleague, Karl-Henrik Grinnemo from the Karolinska Institute, said it was because Macchiarini always contrived a sense of emergency in his work. \n\"It was 'They're severely ill and they will die very soon and \u2026 we can't wait to get the permissions from the regulators',\" Grinnemo told The Guardian last year. \n\"Everything was always in a hurry when it came to Paolo Macchiarini.\" \nThe inquiry's findings are reported here .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david tadevosian/shutterstock", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "seifalian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grinnemo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paolo macchiarini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macchiarini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander seifalian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karl-henrik grinnemo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen wigmore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen thomson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "the guardian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanity fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university college london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russian science foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karolinska institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seifalian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macchiarini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T08:11:28.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d2d64b79ee0117b55178e7b3fcae86a454effdd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGeMXxhEPowgBXzSZmeuOwznsCY4Xfe49zJVLLJQX3273wIVNM7GLUbsxX8MoXaRuMnO0xOb838PdHmVRwX.wrrA--", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "A Strict Diet of Potato, Meat And Cereal Made a Boy Go Blind", "title_full": "A Strict Diet of Potato, Meat And Cereal Made a Boy Go Blind", "published": "2017-10-04T07:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/eye_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d2d64b79ee0117b55178e7b3fcae86a454effdd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGeMXxhEPowgBXzSZmeuOwznsCY4Xfe49zJVLLJQX3273wIVNM7GLUbsxX8MoXaRuMnO0xOb838PdHmVRwX.wrrA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michelle Starr", "published": "2017-10-04T07:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Strict Diet of Potato, Meat And Cereal Made a Boy Go Blind", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd.

JAMA Pediatrics Clinical Challenge A Strict Diet of Potato, Meat And Cereal Made a Boy Go Blind \nBrb, buying carrots. 4 OCT 2017 There may not be much truth to the old folk wisdom that carrots make your eyesight better, but it turns out that not eating your veg will almost certainly make it worse. Doctors have described the case of an 11-year-old boy who presented to their clinic in Canada with severe vision loss, due to a highly restrictive diet. The culprit? A lack of vitamin A. \nHe'd gone to the hospital after eight months of increasing problems. Dry eyes, night blindness, sensitivity to light and increasing vision loss, to the point of severity: by the time he visited The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, he could only see hand movements a maximum of 30 centimetres (12 inches) from his face. \nThe difficulty arose because he also suffered from eczema and multiple food allergies, which meant that his diet was highly restricted. \n\"Owing to concerns about food triggers of his eczema, the child had a restrictive diet consisting solely of potato, pork, lamb, apples, cucumber, and Cheerios,\" the doctors wrote in their case report. \nNone of these food items are particularly high in vitamin A, which, as it turns out, is super important for your vision. The photoreceptor cells in your eyes rely on vitamin A to detect light , and the vitamin also keeps the cornea moist and protected. \nThe patient's eyes were extremely dry, and had keratinised patches with a dry foamy appearance. These are called Bitot's spots , and are a typical symptom of vitamin A deficiency. \nWhen the doctors tested the boy, his vitamin A levels were severely low - 14.33 micrograms per decilitre. A normal range is 25.79-48.71 micrograms per decilitre. \n\"Vitamin A deficiency is generally thought of as a disease that primarily affects people in low resource environments, such as countries in the developing world, where food choices are limited and malnutrition is endemic,\" the doctors wrote. \nTo treat the boy, the doctors administered three megadoses of vitamin A of 200,000 international units each. The first two were administered on the first two days after diagnosis respectively, and the third dose took place two weeks later. \nJAMA Pediatrics Clinical Challenge \nAfter six weeks, the boy's vision had improved to 20/800 in both eyes, and the dryness and Bitot's spots had cleared up, as seen in the image above. However, 20/800 still fits into the legally blind category if it cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 with glasses or contact lenses. \nAnd he may never fully heal. \n\"Vision loss associated with vitamin A deficiency can be reversible; however, in cases with established optic atrophy, as was the case in this patient, a degree of vision loss is likely permanent,\" the doctors wrote. \n\"This patient illustrates the importance of considering micronutrient deficiencies in high-resource settings, particularly in persons for which a diet rich in various food sources is not evident, such as children with highly restrictive diets.\" \nWe're not medical advisors, but if you want to avoid this fate for yourself or your children, it's probably a good idea to ensure that foods rich in vitamin A are part of your diet. This includes foods like liver, kidney, eggs, leafy green vegetables, sweet potatoes, and, yes, carrots. \nThe case report was published online in the journal JAMA Pediatrics Clinical Challenge .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitot", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jama pediatrics clinical challenge", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T08:11:29.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba91d85583a0485fe511b1fafc6bf2a67b3235c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGHfXKJrTrwZ0N8SFmbRZI2ADw5QWeUGpgqRc7nhbRCeT63n1UV5t_wHrgzrBfeWghLReKA0AktgfKAUP0rdlPeWijo4BEFww.GXKFMUch8JA-", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "We're more confident than ever that life on Earth really did come from meteorites - ScienceAlert", "title_full": "We're more confident than ever that life on Earth really did come from meteorites - ScienceAlert", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.143, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/warm-ponds-1_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba91d85583a0485fe511b1fafc6bf2a67b3235c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGHfXKJrTrwZ0N8SFmbRZI2ADw5QWeUGpgqRc7nhbRCeT63n1UV5t_wHrgzrBfeWghLReKA0AktgfKAUP0rdlPeWijo4BEFww.GXKFMUch8JA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Nield", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "We're more confident than ever that life on Earth really did come from meteorites - ScienceAlert", "text": "TERMS & CONDITIONS \u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd.

Pearce, McMaster University We're More Confident Than Ever That Life on Earth Really Did Come From Meteorites \nThey splashed into warm ponds. DAVID NIELD 4 OCT 2017 \nNew research suggests life on our planet started out as a series of meteorites struck the surface and landed in small, warm ponds, kicking off a chemical chain reaction leading to the very first bit of genetic code to exist on Earth. \nWhile the 'warm ponds' hypothesis isn't completely new, the latest study pulls in a host of data and calculations to show just how plausible it is. \nResearchers from McMaster University in Canada and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany say this all started happening just a few million years after the Earth was cool enough for water to form, while the continents were still emerging from the oceans. \n\"No one's actually run the calculation before,\" says one of the team , Ben K. D. Pearce, from McMaster University. \"This is a pretty big beginning. It's pretty exciting.\" \nThe cycle at the centre of the new study. Credit: McMaster University \nThat calculation looked at the possible formation of RNA polymers \u2013 the most basic molecules capable of storing genetic information and catalysing chemical reactions. \nCould they have been formed as meteorite impacts deposited key organic building blocks, which then bonded with elements in the pond water? \nAbsolutely, says the team behind the new study, with the right levels of precipitation and evaporation along the way. Those RNA polymers would eventually have become more complex and developed into DNA, according to the researchers. \nTo back up their working, the scientists pulled in relevant research from astrophysics, geology, chemistry, biology, and other disciplines. \n\"Because there are so many inputs from so many different fields, it's kind of amazing that it all hangs together,\" says one of the researchers , Ralph Pudritz from McMaster University. \n\"Each step led very naturally to the next. To have them all lead to a clear picture in the end is saying there's something right about this.\" \nThe new calculations would put the origins of life on Earth somewhere between 3.7 and 4.5 billion years ago. That's earlier than some experts have put it , but we're still not certain \u2013 one recent rock study suggested the first organisms emerged about 4 billion years ago. \nOther scientists think life first started deeper inside the Earth , through vents under the ocean or hot springs appearing on land. Peering back billions of years through time isn't easy, even with the sharpest minds in science on the case. \nThe researchers behind the warm pond and meteorite study do have one famous scientist behind them they can point to \u2013 Charles Darwin first suggested that life might have sprung up in \"some warm little pond\" back in 1871 . \nNot everyone is convinced the hypothesis checks out, though. Biologist John Sutherland, from the University of Cambridge in the UK, thinks the impact of meteorites hitting land would've vaporised any organic compounds before life had chance to take root. \n\"Large impactors that would have delivered the most organic material, collide with such energy that their organic cargo is atomised,\" he told Michael Marshall at New Scientist . \nNevertheless, the team behind the latest study says their models show a \"consistent scenario\" for the earliest beginnings of life on Earth. What's more, if we can nail down what happened on our own planet, it could be useful in analysing the rest of the cosmos. \nPlenty more research needs to be carried out before we can say for sure just when life began \u2013 and what form it took \u2013 but it seems we're getting closer to an answer. \n\"We have provided plausible physical and chemical information about the conditions under which life could have originated,\" says Dmitry Semenov , one of the contributing researchers from the Max Planck Institute. \n\"Now it's the experimentalists turn to find out how life could indeed have emerged under these very specific early conditions.\" \nThe research has been published in PNAS .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben k. d. pearce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john sutherland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph pudritz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry semenov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmaster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david nield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles darwin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "max planck institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmaster university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmaster university  that", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pnas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max planck institute for astronomy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of cambridge", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "californ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T08:20:48.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61898ecad41ba40625ef2a746634766238ff5cce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGKvV4dqWWR2hd8EfLhZe6MUzSLiyLmyZ3vx6R5eFjUZA1EYbFyYXlUXSnvvuIyxFpZoHBeyixBt6UrMahDx9IS45uZiONaVE0", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Massive solar storm just blasted Mars, causing a spectacular global aurora - ScienceAlert", "title_full": "Massive solar storm just blasted Mars, causing a spectacular global aurora - ScienceAlert", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.046, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/mars-uv-aurora_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61898ecad41ba40625ef2a746634766238ff5cce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGKvV4dqWWR2hd8EfLhZe6MUzSLiyLmyZ3vx6R5eFjUZA1EYbFyYXlUXSnvvuIyxFpZoHBeyixBt6UrMahDx9IS45uZiONaVE0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Nield", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Massive solar storm just blasted Mars, causing a spectacular global aurora - ScienceAlert", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd.

DAVID NIELD 3 OCT 2017 \nTurn your attention to the stars and you don't have to wait long to see something literally out of this world \u2013 like the global ultraviolet aurora that just occurred on Mars, which was 25 times brighter than anything we've observed on the Red Planet before. \nTriggered by a strong blast of solar wind from the Sun, the event also sent the planet's radiation levels soaring, to more than twice the maximum level previously recorded by the Curiosity Rover's Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD). \nThese spectacular aurora light shows we can observe on Earth, Mars, and other planets are caused as high energy particles spewing out of the Sun hit planetary magnetic fields, causing chemical reactions with gases in the atmosphere. \nAccording to Sonal Jain, from the University of Colorado and part of NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution team ( MAVEN ), this particular blast of energy from our star \"lit up Mars like a lightbulb\" with ultraviolet light. \n\"An aurora on Mars can envelope the entire planet because Mars has no strong magnetic field like Earth's to concentrate the aurora near polar regions,\" says Jain . \n\"The energetic particles from the Sun also can be absorbed by the upper atmosphere, increasing its temperature and causing it to swell up.\" \nThe purple/white shows UV intensity over Mars. Credit: NASA/Univ. of Colorado \nThe MAVEN orbiter has been tracking the interaction of solar wind with the Martian atmosphere since 2014, and together with data collected from Curiosity stretching back to 2011, we're getting some vital information about conditions on Mars. \nIf we're eventually going to live on the planet , we'll need to know when and how to take cover when this dramatic events occur. They'll be great to look at, but not so great to be outdoors in, as the radiation readings show. \n\"If you were outdoors on a Mars walk and learned that an event like this was imminent, you would definitely want to take shelter, just as you would if you were on a space walk outside the International Space Station,\" says one of the RAD team , Don Hassler from the Southwest Research Institute. \n\"To protect our astronauts on Mars in the future, we need to continue to provide this type of space weather monitoring there.\" \nThough we're better protected by the Earth's magnetic field, scientists are still worried that a freakishly big solar storm could knock out most of our planet's communications equipment. To be prepared, we need to learn as much as possible about these space weather events . \nIn fact, scientists think that solar winds are responsible for stripping the Earth-like atmosphere off of Mars billions of years ago \u2013 another discovery made possible with data collected from MAVEN. \nOddly enough, this off-the-charts solar event has come during what's usually a quiet period in the Sun's 11-year cycle of sunspots and storm activity. \nNASA scientists are now digging deeper into the data to find out what we can learn from it, but it's likely to teach us a lot about how we can deal with these events in the future, as well as the composition of the Martian atmosphere itself. \n\"It will improve our understanding of how such solar events affect the Martian environment, from the top of the atmosphere all the way down to the surface,\" says Hassler .

All rights reserved. Dmitriy Rybin/Shutterstock.com A Rare Element From The Edge of The Periodic Table Is Breaking Quantum Mechanics \nThis is amazing. 4 OCT 2017 \nThere's a lot we don't know about the actinides. On the periodic table, this series of heavy, radioactive elements hangs at the bottom, and includes a host of mysterious substances that don't naturally occur on Earth. \nAmong this cast of unknowns, berkelium looks to be even stranger than we realised. New experiments with this incredibly rare synthetic element have shown that its electrons don't behave the way they should, defying quantum mechanics. \n\"It's almost like being in an alternate universe because you're seeing chemistry you simply don't see in everyday elements,\" says chemist Thomas Albrecht-Schmitt from Florida State University. \nFor years, Albrecht-Schmitt has studied the complex, radioactive world of actinides, including plutonium, californium, and berkelium. \nThe latter, discovered in 1949, was named after the Berkeley scientists who first produced it, and one of the reasons it's so little understood, apart from its radioactivity, is because it's so difficult (and prohibitively expensive) to synthesise. \nIt's estimated that less than 1 gram of the element has been synthesised in the past 50 years. For his latest research, Albrecht-Schmitt was trusted with a whole 13 milligrams of the radioactive metal by the Department of Energy. \nThat might not seem like much, sure, but it's about 1,000 times more than anyone else has given for major research studies, and it enabled the researchers to observe something they never expected to see. \nIn a series of experiments over three years, the team engineered various compounds out of berkelium and observed that their electrons behaved unusually. \nAt the top end of the periodic table, which is dominated by light elements, electrons line up in configurations that are explained by quantum theory , which determines how electrons ' spin ' around an atom's nucleus. \nWhat Albrecht-Schmitt and fellow researchers discovered is that when it comes to berkelium, and other heavy elements, the principles of quantum mechanics can't actually explain what the electrons are doing. \nInstead, it looks like the electrons are governed by Einstein's theory of relativity , which predicts that as objects with mass move faster, they get heavier. \nIn terms of the electrons in berkelium, the thinking goes that as the electrons begin to move at extremely fast speeds around each atom's highly charged nucleus \u2013 at up to significant fractions of the speed of light \u2013 this causes them to become heavy, and behave in ways that defy a quantum explanation of events. \n\"When you see this interesting phenomenon, you start asking yourself all these questions like how can you make it stronger or shut it down,\" says Albrecht-Schmitt . \n\"A few years ago, no one even thought you could make a berkelium compound.\" \nThe work builds upon previous research involving berkelium compounds published last year by the same team, which also teased that berkelium was \"electronically different than what people expected\". \nAs this body of work builds, it's yet more evidence that berkelium, like the periodic table itself , is something that's almost impossible to pin down \u2013 and it remains to be seen just how far these mysterious actinides will make our best theories bend or break. \n\"What this really gives us is an understanding of how chemistry is changing late in the table,\" Albrecht-Schmitt explained last year . \n\"The purpose is to understand the underlying chemistry of the element. Even after having [berkelium] for almost 70 years, many of the basic chemical properties are still unknown.\" \nThe findings are reported in the Journal of the American Chemical Society .

All rights reserved. Reich Lab/eLife Scientists Have Finally Discovered Proof That Our Brains Have a Waste Drainage System \nFluid goes in, fluid has to come out. MIKE MCRAE 4 OCT 2017 \nRunning through your body is a network of channels and junctions called the lymphatic system , which siphons off waste and fluids like a biological sewer. \nIt was long thought the brain was excluded from this web of anatomical plumbing. After being spotted in mice brains two years ago, researchers have now confirmed the presence of lymphatic vessels in human brains, fueling speculation over the kinds of diseases they might be responsible for. \nWay back in 1816 , an Italian anatomist by the name of Paolo Mascagni saw what he thought were lymphatic vessels running across the human brain of the cadavers he was dissecting. \nIf he did, his eyesight was stellar \u2013 in spite of two centuries of searching, nobody else could find them. \nThe lymphatic system is made up of branching vessels transporting white blood cells in a clear fluid called lymph around the body. \nIts purpose is to keep the fluids between tissues moving and provide easy access for the immune cells to maintain law and order deep inside our tissues. \nThe fact that nobody could replicate Mascagni's discovery wasn't exactly a perplexing mystery. A dense wall of cells called a blood-brain barrier separates the circulatory system from our grey matter, helping to protect it from potential nasties. \nWhile most organs in the body have a tight working relationship with the cells of the immune system, the brain is like a delicate piece of art kept behind glass. \nThe absence of tiny drainage pipes keeping our nervous tissue clear of filth, pathogens, and debris just added to the belief that the brain was a special case in anatomy. \nIt did prompt one niggling question. \nWhite blood cells were known to wander the brain's corridors in search of intruders. How the hell did they get in and out? \nIn 2015 , that question finally got an answer. By studying the brains of mice, American researchers finally identified the presence of a lymphatic system in the mammalian central nervous system. \nThey reported seeing \" potentially similar \" structures in the dura \u2013 the nervous system's tough outer membrane \u2013 of human cadavers, but the jury was still out. \nA lecture given by the study's lead researcher, Jonathan Kipnis, got the attention of neurophysiologist Daniel S. Reich from the National Institute of Health in the US. \n\"I was completely surprised. In medical school, we were taught that the brain has no lymphatic system,\" said Reich. \n\"After Dr Kipnis' talk, I thought, maybe we could find it in human brains?\" \nTo find them, the team injected five healthy volunteers with a contrasting agent called gadobutrol , and then scanned their brains using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \nThis made the dura visible, but alas, there was no sign of a lymphatic system. \nMRI scans can be tweaked so the radio pulses vary in timing or with respect to the time they take echo. Different weightings of these measures can reveal subtle differences in anatomical features. \nWhen Reich and his team used a different tuning on the MRI the blood vessels faded, leaving signs of another arrangement of channels they imagined to belong to a lymphatic system. \nTo make sure, they used another dye made up of molecules that were too big to leak out of blood vessels. \nSure enough, when they repeated their tuning, all signs of the mysterious lines were gone. \nThe team constructed a 3D rendering of one of the channels in one volunteer's brain, which you can check out below. \n\nThe same results were confirmed in marmoset monkeys, and physical evidence of the vessels were also detected in the dura of autopsied human brain tissue. \nAll up, the case of the brain's missing lymphatic system seems to be fairly solid. \n\"For years we knew how fluid entered the brain. Now we may finally see that, like other organs in the body, brain fluid can drain out through the lymphatic system,\" says Reich . \nThe next step for researchers is to study variations in this drainage system to see if they can help explain deeper health conditions. \n\"These results could fundamentally change the way we think about how the brain and immune system inter-relate,\" said Walter J.

Allef Vinicius / Unsplash 15-Year-Old Tattoo Caused a Cancer-Like Reaction in a Woman's Lymph Nodes Warning: it's pretty gross. 3 OCT 2017 Well, we can add this to the list of weird things tattoos can do to your body: apparently they can mimic the symptoms of cancer, many years after the fact. \nMore precisely, lymphoma, as the case of a 30-year-old woman attests. She went to a clinic at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital because she'd noticed lumps in both her armpits two weeks prior - a common symptom of lymphoma. \nOn examination, doctors detected a number of rubbery, non-tethered lumps up to 1.5 centimetres (0.6 inches) in diameter, but none of her other symptoms were consistent with lymphoma. She had no fever, no weight loss, no excessive sweating, and no itching or pulmonary symptoms. \nWhen one of the lymph nodes was excised and examined, the woman's doctors found macrophages, the immune cells that \"eat\" invading foreign bodies, laden with black pigments from a large black-ink back tattoo she had had inked 15 years prior. \n\"We report a case of tattoo pigment hypersensitivity causing widespread lymphadenopathy 15 years after the tattoo was initially inked,\" the doctors wrote in their paper . \n\"To the best of our knowledge, the PET-CT findings of markedly glucose-avid nodes in multiple areas have not previously been described. This feature in combination with the clinical findings mimicked lymphoma.\" *gross picture warning* \nOne of the excised lymph nodes. Credit: Annals of Internal Medicine \nTattoo reactions are not uncommon. Sometimes the host is allergic to something in the ink, or develops hypersensitivity at the site of the tattoo, or poor hygiene by either the studio or the client can cause an infection. This usually occurs when the tattoo is fresh, and at the site of the tattoo. \nHowever, delayed reactions can occur. One man had an allergy-type reaction 20 years after getting a tattoo . There have also been several cases where tattoos have mimicked the symptoms of lymphoma of the skin - and at least one where these pseudolymphomas evolved into overt lymphomas . \nThere have also been several cases where tattoo pigment in the lymph nodes mimics metastatic malignant melanoma - but this particular patient did not have melanoma. \nIt's well known that some particles from tattoo pigment ends up in the lymph nodes, deposited there by the immune system. Recent research also found that nanoparticles end up there as well , which could be a problem since the chemical composition of the pigment can vary from studio to studio. \nBut this is the first known case of a tattoo causing a reaction in the lymph nodes - and absolutely none at all in the skin. \n\"The case we describe is unique in that there was no skin reaction, only granulomatous change within the lymph nodes. In addition, no cutaneous, pulmonary, or systemic symptoms were observed to suggest systemic sarcoidosis,\" the doctors wrote . \n\"We believe that this case highlights the importance of a careful tattoo history and physical examination.\" \nThe case was detailed in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine .

Whatever you have going on, you're probably not as fed up as this eight-year-old boy from Argentina who inhaled a piece of a pet toy. With every deep breath the boy takes in, the whistle makes a sad hooting sound. \nA video of the unimpressed patient was filmed in the hospital waiting room and posted to Facebook by his doctor, Santiago Gomez Zuviria, to raise awareness of the hazards small swallowable objects pose to children. \n\"My only intention was to make my contacts aware of the risks to which the smallest children are exposed with the use of toys that should not be qualified for marketing,\" he wrote on a later Facebook post . \nIn a way, the boy was lucky - the item he inhaled allows for the passage of air, no matter how squeaky that passage is. \nThis is the reasoning behind pen caps that have holes in them - lots of people chew on pen caps, and if one gets stuck in your windpipe, you're much more likely to survive if there's holes for the air to flow through. \nSantiago Gomez Zuviria/Facebook \nThis is particularly important for children, who are apt to put many strange items in their mouths. According to the New York State Department of Health, more than 12,000 children are hospitalised every year for choking on food. \nSwallowing objects is a problem too - coin batteries and magnets are particularly dangerous, the former because they can cause severe tissue burns , and the latter because if more than one magnet is swallowed , they can damage the intestine by attracting each other through the loops. \nHoles don't guarantee safety, as seen in a tragic case from Odisha, India . A seven-year-old boy swallowed a whistle, and survived for 48 hours with it lodged in his larynx, but ultimately choked to death. \nThe big problem is that once something gets stuck down there, you can't just cough it up. Thankfully, the boy in Zuviria's clip only required a local anaesthetic to remove the tiny piece of plastic from his windpipe. \nBut the good news is that he's now expected to make a full recovery - with video proof for the cautionary tale he'll one day tell his kids.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "santiago gomez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "santiago gomez zuviria", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york state department of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zuviria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odisha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:18:35.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f330dd1790feeeb88a3a8cae7f313dfc603ff968", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG3gPgIK1znzGEfvNiEiDkaXaq5bmG6gkmjduY8LE0.bJhaFQk94_disQjH8UfcXtRrSlvZRfl6kJWZW2BtdxtZlKMCXjBzim6", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "Scientists Have Developed Surgical Glue That Seals Wounds in 60 Seconds", "title_full": "Scientists Have Developed Surgical Glue That Seals Wounds in 60 Seconds", "published": "2017-10-04T22:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/metro-gel-1_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f330dd1790feeeb88a3a8cae7f313dfc603ff968", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG3gPgIK1znzGEfvNiEiDkaXaq5bmG6gkmjduY8LE0.bJhaFQk94_disQjH8UfcXtRrSlvZRfl6kJWZW2BtdxtZlKMCXjBzim6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Nield", "published": "2017-10-04T22:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scientists Have Developed Surgical Glue That Seals Wounds in 60 Seconds", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. University of Sydney Scientists Have Developed Surgical Glue That Seals Wounds in 60 Seconds \nThis could save so many lives. DAVID NIELD 4 OCT 2017 \nScientists have developed an elastic, adhesive surgical glue that could transform emergency treatments by sealing up critical wounds in the skin or the organs, without the need for staples or sutures . \nThe gel is based on methacryloyl-substituted tropoelastin (MeTro for short), a hybrid elastic protein , and can be squirted onto internal and external wounds to seal them up and encourage healing. \nAccording to the international team of researchers behind the glue, it could quite literally be a lifesaver, sealing up wounds in 60 seconds without stopping the natural expanding and relaxing of the organ or the skin it's applied to. \nTo be clear, for now the trials are limited to animal models. But human trials are in the works, and the results to date are incredibly promising. \n\"The beauty of the MeTro formulation is that, as soon as it comes in contact with tissue surfaces, it solidifies into a gel-like phase without running away,\" says one of the team , Nasim Annabi from Northeastern University, in Boston. \nOnce in place, the sealant is put under ultraviolet light to secure it. \n\"We then further stabilise it by curing it on-site with a short light-mediated crosslinking treatment. This allows the sealant to be very accurately placed and to tightly bond and interlock with structures on the tissue surface.\" \nWounds treated with MeTro can heal up in half the time compared with stitches or staples, the researchers claim, and if surgery is required then MeTro can simplify that procedure too. \nThanks to a degrading enzyme built into the glue, it can be modified to last for a certain amount of time (between hours and months) depending on the types of injury. \nIn emergency situations where speed is critical, MeTro could make a huge difference in sealing wounds or lung punctures. In fact it works a little like silicone sealants you might use on tiles in the kitchen or bathroom. \nHuman trials have not yet started: so far it's been successfully tested on rodent arteries and lungs, and pig lungs. \nMeTro can help with organs that are difficult to patch up, like the lungs. Credit: University of Sydney \n\"When you watch MeTro, you can see it act like a liquid, filling the gaps and conforming to the shape of the wound,\" says one of the researchers , Anthony Weiss from the University of Sydney in Australia. \n\"The potential applications are powerful \u2013 from treating serious internal wounds at emergency sites such as following car accidents and in war zones, as well as improving hospital surgeries.\" \nThe scientists behind the gel report that it's simple to apply, can be easily stored, and works closely with natural tissue to heal a wound. What's more, it degrades without leaving any kind of toxic leftovers in the body. \nFor one of the team, Ali Khademhosseini from the Harvard Medical School, the new glue comes from years of work into how MeTro gels can be used to repair the body. \nIt's also one of several ways researchers are exploring to engineer our body's own natural substances to help repair it when needed. \nIf the MeTro gel can be further developed into a commercial product, it could well become an essential part of a first responder's toolkit. \n\"We have shown MeTro works in a range of different settings and solves problems other available sealants can't,\" says Weiss . \"We're now ready to transfer our research into testing on people. I hope MeTro will soon be used in the clinic, saving human lives.\" \nThe research has been published in Science Translational Medicine .

MIKE MCRAE 4 OCT 2017 \nFor over 20 years, physicists have puzzled over why space appears to be flying apart at the seams. \nNew research is adding some deeper insight into the mysterious repulsive force known as dark energy, providing evidence that whatever it might be, its ghostly influence hasn't been constant over time. \nIn 2016 , an international team of researchers accurately measured fluctuations in the density of visible matter through the Universe over long periods of its history. \nThese shifts \u2013 called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) \u2013 provide something of a yardstick for cosmologists studying relative distances over time. \nJust as astronomers have used light from distant exploding stars to conclude the Universe is spreading out, cosmologists (big picture astronomers) have used BAO. \nWhichever of these two tools we use, it looks as if the Universe has been gaining real estate over the 13.82 billion years of its existence, causing clumps of material in it to spread out. \nWeirder yet, that growth has been speeding up for quite some time. \nThe unit used to describe this expansion is called the Hubble Constant , and is thought to be the result of the tension between matter pulling itself together and the swelling of space in between. \nWhy is space growing? Nobody is really all that certain, and that's a problem. \nTo help come up with an explanation astrophysicists look at the hum of empty space as if it has qualities, and isn't just an empty stage for fields and particles. \nThe odds-on favourite description at the moment is called the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (\u039bCDM) model, which combines what's referred to as the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model of empty space with a distribution of visible and invisible matter within it. \nIn this model, dark energy is the constant push of emptiness between masses , possibly caused by the hiss of particles popping in and out of virtual existence. \nBut the \u039bCDM model is built on a number of assumptions , leaving open the question; does dark energy need to be among the fundamental qualities of space, static over time? \nOr could it be influenced by its surroundings, shifting as the Universe changes? \n\"Since its discovery at the end of last century, dark energy has been a riddle wrapped in an enigma,\" says researcher Bob Nichol from the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation (ICG) at the University of Portsmouth. \n\"We are all desperate to gain some greater insight into its characteristics and origin.\" \nArmed with more accurate measures of these tides of matter pulsing like a cosmic heartbeat, the researchers applied their BAO data to a dark energy model developed by Gong-Bo Zhao,   Portsmouth and the National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC). \nThe study's results point to a more dynamic description of this mysterious force. \nThis conclusion is based in part on a conflict between data produced by the team's own BAO survey and interpretations based on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) \u2013 the echo of light bouncing through the Universe since moments after the Big Bang. \nThis diagram on the BAO (SDSS-IV) survey gives you some idea of how it relates to the CMB. \nSloan Digital Sky Survey \nOne way the researchers found they could resolve this difference is to treat dark energy as if it is dynamic changing with time. \nIf true, it would mean dark energy isn't a force produced by the bubbling of a vacuum. \nThe significance of their results isn't enough to overturn the evidence favouring the static dark energy feature of the \u039bCDM model. \nBut that could all change with data collected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument when it starts its survey next year. \n\"We are excited to see that current observations are able to probe the dynamics of dark energy at this level, and we hope that future observations will confirm what we see today,\" says Zhao . \nWhatever the outcome, it'll be worth it \u2013 the fate of the Universe is at stake, after all. \nThis research was published in Nature Astronomy .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zhao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike mcrae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob nichol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gong-bo zhao", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naoc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute of cosmology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sloan digital sky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of portsmouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national astronomical observatories of china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "portsmouth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T02:44:45.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2cd7ccd6f1a76692e4e9fba633d498fdd14d1ce1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGUC9_eI9046T.qRveuXlko7NORDpl7QLAm.ONZL5LErMSHdUifu9t3Y.mtRmQP6oevuGoJVr9rSb557ZeQHoSeja9VBr95B_MdNWo0X.CTSw-", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "There Could Be a Spectacular Cache of Statues in The Antikythera Shipwreck", "title_full": "There Could Be a Spectacular Cache of Statues in The Antikythera Shipwreck", "published": "2017-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/anti_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2cd7ccd6f1a76692e4e9fba633d498fdd14d1ce1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGUC9_eI9046T.qRveuXlko7NORDpl7QLAm.ONZL5LErMSHdUifu9t3Y.mtRmQP6oevuGoJVr9rSb557ZeQHoSeja9VBr95B_MdNWo0X.CTSw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michelle Starr", "published": "2017-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "There Could Be a Spectacular Cache of Statues in The Antikythera Shipwreck", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. Return to Antikythera/YouTube There Could Be a Spectacular Cache of Statues in The Antikythera Shipwreck A new expedition is set to retrieve them. MICHELLE STARR 5 OCT 2017 The Roman shipwreck that once housed the mysterious Antikythera Mechanism - often referred to as the world's oldest computer - just got a lot more interesting. The latest dive to excavate artefacts from the wreck off the coast of Antikythera, Greece, has yielded up new treasure that hints at at much more to come. Hidden under boulders in a previously unexplored section of the site, the excavation team uncovered, among other items, the lid of a sarcophagus, a mysterious bronze disc decorated with a bull, and a life-sized human arm from a bronze statue. \nBut perhaps the most tantalising thing they brought back was an indication that there is still a lot more from the almost 2,100-year-old Greek shipwreck to be retrieved, thanks to a bespoke metal detector that has revealed the presence of a large cache of metal. \n\"There should be at least seven statues,\" diver Alexandros Sotiriou told The Guardian . \nHow did the team arrive at that count? Because in 1900-01, the sponge divers that discovered the wreck already retrieved orphan limbs from six different statues. This new limb marks the seventh - and if we can find and retrieve those statues, it will be a treasure of unimaginable value. \nBrett Seymour/EUA/ARGO 2017 \nThis is because so few bronze statues from classical Greece have survived. Bronze was a valuable material, and many statues were melted down so that it could be reused. Many others were lost at sea. \nFewer than 200 bronzes are known to be extant today , including heads without bodies and bodies without heads. \nOne of those is the Antikythera Youth , retrieved from the wreck in fragments in 1900-1901, and pieced back together in 1902 - so there's strong precedent to suggest that complete statues could eventually be raised from the seafloor. \nThe dive to the 50-metre-deep wreck, conducted by the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities and Lund University, took place from 4 to 20 September 2017 in a region that had been buried by boulders shifted by earthquakes over the almost 2,100 years since the wreck. \nBecause this area was undisturbed by previous excavations, the team is excited. \"We think this means that everything is down there still,\" Brendan Foley from the University of Lund told Nature . \nThe wreck came to fame after the discovery of a mysterious item called the Antikythera Mechanism , pictured below, the purpose of which has been puzzling scientists since it was first excavated in 1901. \nThe Antikythera Mechanism. Image: Marsyas/WikiCommons \nThe disc-shaped device has a system of gears inside, and is thought to be a computer of some kind to study the sky. \nOne of the items retrieved from the recent dive appeared, superficially, to resemble the Antikythera Mechanism - bronze, disc-shaped, with four short arms with holes for screws, heavily encrusted with sediment. \nThe team hoped that it might be part of the Mechanism and would yield more clues as to its purpose. \nReconstruction of the newly discovered disc. Image: EUA (left) and Alexander Tourtas \nBut intriguingly, CT scanning revealed not gears, but the image of a bull hidden under the layers of sediment, reconstructed by an artist as seen in the image above. It was probably, the researchers think, a decorative element, perhaps for a shield. More detailed study will take place over the coming weeks. \nPreviously, the Greek government's Return to Antikythera project has brought up glassware , marble statues , ceramic amphorae , lamps , and even a 2,100-year-old human skeleton , the DNA of which could reveal more information about who was on the ship, and why. \nWith this expedition, the team found more human remains, which will hopefully help fill in more of that particular picture, as well as wooden planks that may have been part of the actual ship - and may provide clues as to its size. \nThe next expedition is planned to take place in May 2018, and the divers are going to go into the ship's hold - where the cargo would have been stored. \n\"All the other things that would have been carried should be down there as well,\" Foley said . \"Every day is going to be like opening Tut's tomb.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander tourtas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandros sotiriou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle starr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brendan foley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of lund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the guardian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greek ephorate of underwater antiquities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lund university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antikythera", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T05:07:58.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7fc589a16f8a4eae289c8f7acf3bab4088bf81e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG3gPgIK1znzE33aGjKYMlwz.a7N7mO0KMLaEzfi8sgbBgeguQ1Zi8wjFL52MLY.RpYXF4sG.lAqNSYUX04AZ5860QMfbIlxP1", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "Severe Liver Damage Case Study Shows The Dangers of Naturopathy", "title_full": "Severe Liver Damage Case Study Shows The Dangers of Naturopathy", "published": "2017-10-05T09:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/naturopathy-pill-box-flowers-shutterstock_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fc589a16f8a4eae289c8f7acf3bab4088bf81e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG3gPgIK1znzE33aGjKYMlwz.a7N7mO0KMLaEzfi8sgbBgeguQ1Zi8wjFL52MLY.RpYXF4sG.lAqNSYUX04AZ5860QMfbIlxP1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike McRae", "published": "2017-10-05T09:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Severe Liver Damage Case Study Shows The Dangers of Naturopathy", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. TwilightArtPictures/Shutterstock Severe Liver Damage Case Study Shows The Dangers of Naturopathy \nNatural isn't always best. 5 OCT 2017 \nOne for the medical text books; a 38-year-old male with gallstones presents with dark urine and loss of appetite, and after a few more tests is quickly diagnosed with severe liver damage. \nThe cause? A two week course of magnesium sulfate, commonly advised by practitioners of naturopathy as a liver \"flush\". \nThis particular side effect itself is a medical first. But the case study also provides evidence in support of concerns over the role science plays in alternative medical practices. \nMagnesium sulfate \u2013 or good old Epsom salts \u2013 has its uses as a medical treatment. It's often prescribed in small amounts as a laxative , or injected in controlled doses to treat pregnant women with severe eclampsia. \nThe science is a little more dubious when it comes to its benefits as a muscle relaxant or as a way to ease aches and pains. \nAs for gallstones, the research is a ghost town. Not that a lack of scientific evidence stops naturopaths from confidently prescribing it as a way to \"cleanse\" the liver. \nWhile advice can vary, in this particular case the gentleman was instructed to dissolve three tablespoons \u2013 just under 50 grams \u2013 of Epsom salt crystals in lukewarm water each day, and drink the solution. \nThe intention was for the salts to dilate the bile ducts and help remove the build-up of minerals in the gallbladder that was causing the patient distress. Or something like that. \nIn worst case scenarios \u2013 such as in this 2009 case study of a 46 year old woman who attempted to take her own life by downing 2 kilograms of the stuff \u2013 ingestion of magnesium sulfate might result in vomiting, confusion, limb weakness, and changes to the heart's rhythm. Damage to the kidneys is also a real possibility. \nFor the average person, the worst effects might be a few extra runs to the bathroom that day. \nSadly for the subject in this case study, the results were far worse than diarrhoea. \nOn the 12th day of his treatment he reported noticing a drop in appetite and a darkening of his urine. Two days after completing the course he saw signs of jaundice \u2013 a yellowing of the skin and eyes caused by a change in liver functions. \nScans and blood tests backed up suspicions that his liver was enlarged and struggling to do its job. The man wasn't an alcoholic, and provided no other convenient explanations for his condition. \nWhile none of this is proof positive that the Epsom salts were responsible, a process called the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) was used to connect the liver damage with the treatment to the satisfaction of the medical team. \nA little over a month later, without further magnesium salt beverages, the man's liver functions returned to normal. \nBeyond speculation of the potential influence of fatty liver disease (or steatohepatitis ), there's no obvious cause behind this individual's unique reaction. \nA typical gall stone usually forms and passes without symptoms. In the few percent of cases it causes problems, it's usually a cramping in the abdomen that soon passes. \nEvery now and then their presence leads to complications that might require medication or surgical intervention. \nFor the most part, a short-term course of Epson salts probably wouldn't have caused harm, and would even appear to work, making it seem like a reasonable gamble for those experiencing mild discomfort. \nWithout making too many assumptions on this specific case, naturopathy tends to be a practice based on the premise that the body heals itself and interventions shouldn't deviate too far from what you'd find in the natural world. \nFor all of its appeal as a worldview, treatments are rarely based on evidence taken from literature in the medical community. And this can be a problem. \nTedious, arduous, and expensive as they are, clinical trials are conducted on potential medications (such as Epsom salts) to identify and describe these kinds of risks versus benefits, providing medical practitioners with sufficient information to make fair judgements. \nEven something as innocuous as swallowing a glass of magnesium sulfate each day could have a severe impact on a minority of people, a risk many might not be willing to take. \nMedicine based on scientific evidence has its fair share of problems . There's no doubt about it.

Copernicus Sentinel\u20131/BAS That Giant Antarctic Iceberg Just Revealed an Ecosystem Hidden For Thousands of Years \n\"A fantastic, unknown area for scientific research.\" PETER DOCKRILL 5 OCT 2017 \nWhen a vast trillion-tonne chunk of ice the size of Delaware broke free from Antarctica in July , it didn't just set loose one of the largest icebergs scientists have ever witnessed. \nThe massive calving also uncovered a mysterious and precious marine ecosystem hidden under the ice that could have been buried for up to 120,000 years \u2013 and it's vital we protect this isolated sanctuary now it's been laid bare. \n\"I cannot imagine a more dramatic shift in environmental conditions in any ecosystem on Earth,\" marine ecologist Julian Gutt from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany told Nature . \nThat epic transition is due to the iceberg \u2013 which is called A\u201368 \u2013 drifting and disintegrating northwards into the Weddell Sea and away from its former moorings, the Larsen C ice shelf . \nAs this migration takes place \u2013 whether caused by climate change or not \u2013 a vast expanse of ocean and seabed measuring some 5,818 square kilometres (2,246 square miles) is slowly being exposed to sunlight and open marine conditions for what scientists think could be the first time since Earth's last inter-glacial period . \nWith the wraps coming off this pristine, unexplored environment, scientists are eager to study these unseen waters and the life forms they may contain \u2013 and thankfully, they'll now get a chance to do so. \nUnder an international agreement adopted only last year by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), the emerging ecosystem classifies as a Special Area for Scientific Study, which is granted to newly exposed marine areas following ice-shelf retreat or collapse. \nThe protections mean the exposed area will carry prohibitions on commercial fishing for at least two years, which can be extended for an extra 10 years \u2013 a timeframe designed to give scientists a chance to assess what marine life might exist there already, and to observe new species colonise the freshly uncovered waters. \n\"It's just a fantastic, unknown area for scientific research,\" marine biologist Susan Grant from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) told Live Science . \n\"We know very little about what might or might not be living in these types of areas, and especially how they might change over time.\" \nGrant was one of the researchers who led the proposal to the CCAMLR for Special Area recognition, and the BAS intends to send a research vessel to study the area in early 2018, provided their funding comes through. \nSouth Korean and German expeditions are also planned for 2018 and 2019 respectively, as researchers race to examine the terrain as early as possible, before exposure to the surface and sunlight yields too many changes to the shielded waters. \n\"It's very difficult to mobilise research efforts \u2013 it takes a lot of money, and ship time is not an easy thing to arrange, especially at short notice,\" Grant explained to Live Science . \n\"But the fact that a lot of groups are trying really hard to get something down there demonstrates that this is a really unique opportunity.\" \nAs for what scientists can expect to find when they arrive, nobody knows for sure, but the most recent historical precedent for something like this was the collapse of the Larsen A and B ice shelves \u2013 in 1995 and 2002. \n\"Life there is sparse,\" BAS researcher Phil Trathan told Live Science . \n\"The working hypothesis is that it is similar to the very deep oceans, but that is something that needs to be tested.\" \nBut while these undersea environments devoid of sunlight and food resources may seem like virtual ghost towns, they're still hugely important to study \u2013 especially as they won't stay that way for long, with new species beginning to colonise the exposed waters once it emerges. \n\"You'll have sunlight, you'll have phytoplankton, and you'll begin to get zooplankton and fish in there pretty quickly,\" Trathan said . \n\"So, it will be sort of a chain reaction \u2013 as you get productivity happening then you'll get more species coming in, and so there will be quite significant changes over relatively short time scales.\" \nThe issues of the epic iceberg calving in the first place remain. But now it's done it is a wonderful opportunity to see life adapt to virgin territory \u2013 we just have to make it there in time to catch the early show.

PETER DOCKRILL 5 OCT 2017 \nDespite what you may have heard, Santa Claus is \u2013 or was \u2013 real, and archaeologists in Turkey think they've pinpointed the location of his final resting place. \nCenturies before the jolly red mascot became a fixture of Christmas consumerism, Saint Nicholas was a 4th century bishop who inspired the modern Santa myth \u2013 and new claims suggest the grave of this gift-giving churchman lies beneath an ancient church in southern Turkey. \nAfter three months of investigations, Turkish archaeologists say they've discovered what looks like an intact temple and burial grounds underneath Saint Nicholas Church in the province of Antalya, in a town called Demre \u2013 formerly known as Myra, where Saint Nicholas was made bishop. \nIt's thought that this undisturbed tomb, if that's what it truly is, could be where the revered saint was laid to rest. \n\"The temple on the ground of the church is in good condition,\" the director of surveying and monuments in Antalya, Cemil Karabayram, told Turkish newspaper H\u00fcrriyet Daily News . \n\"We believe that it has received no damage so far. But it is hard to enter it because there are stones with motifs on the ground. These stones should be scaled one by one and then removed.\" \nIf the archaeologists are right, it could mean the history books will need some updating. \nIt has been traditionally thought that Saint Nicholas's remains had been transported to the city of Bari in Italy by Italian merchants in 1087, some 700 years after his death . \nAccording to that interpretation, the sailors smuggled or stole his bones to preserve them during a period when the town was under frequent attacks by Seljuk Turks . \nThese conflicts resulted in the church being demolished and rebuilt, which is when the remains are thought to have been taken from Saint Nicholas's grave, despite the objections of Greek Orthodox monks. \nBut if this is what took place, it's possible the traders may not have retrieved all the bones, as other relics are thought to have ended up in Venice and elsewhere. \nSjoehest/Wikimedia/ CC BY-SA 3.0 \nAccording to the current researchers' hypothesis, none of these bones belonged to Saint Nicholas, however \u2013 as the grave they were taken from (pictured above) was not his, but that of another anonymous priest buried in the church. \nDocuments studied by the team suggest that Saint Nicholas instead was buried in an untouched chamber that lies underneath the church, which the researchers claim to have detected using a CT scanner and ground-penetrating radar. \nSeveral mosaics in the church's stonework make accessing this section difficult, but the researchers are hopeful that future excavations will prove their discovery is legitimate. \n\"We have obtained very good results but real works start now,\" Karabayram said . \n\"We will reach the ground and maybe we will find the untouched body of Saint Nicholas.\" \nOf course, until further investigations are carried out, the claims remain unsubstantiated, and some at least have their doubts. \n\"This speculation is very premature,\" Carol Meyers, who runs an organisation dedicated to Saint Nicholas's legacy , told National Geographic . \n\"If relics are found, they would need to be dated and examined by international experts. The Turks, of course, are very interested in promoting tourism.\" \nThat last point is definitely something to consider. The researchers themselves acknowledge that the discovery could have massive potential for Turkish tourism, and Demre already benefits from its lucrative association with the saint. \n\"We are so happy with Saint Nicholas,\" Demre-based shopkeeper Baris Yuksel explained to CNN back in 2010. \n\"After lots of centuries we are earning money thanks to Saint Nicholas.\" \nOnly more digging will be able to tell us if there's more to these claims, but as far as Karabayram believes, Santa Claus is very, very real. \n\"The world's eyes will be set on here,\" he told H\u00fcrriyet Daily News . \n\"We claim that St. Nicholas has been kept in this temple without any damage.

MICHELLE STARR 5 OCT 2017 \nJapanese people are, overall, pretty healthy, with one of the highest average lifespans in the world. But among high risk factors for death in Japan is hypertension, or high blood pressure. Japan has the second-highest rate of chronic kidney disease in the world, with one in every eight people affected. Now researchers have determined that it may have something to do with the structure of their kidneys at birth. More specifically, the problem might lie with nephrons, the structural unit in the kidneys that's responsible for filtering. \nAccording to a team from Monash University's Biomedicine Discovery Institute in Australia and the Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo, Japanese people have far fewer nephrons than average - and this has broader health implications. \nThe idea that a lower nephron count could be responsible for hypertension was first floated in the 1980s, said lead researcher John Bertram from Monash University, who has decades worth of experience in nephron research. \nThe link makes sense - the kidney determines the amount of both sodium and renin in the bloodstream. Sodium raises the blood pressure, and renin regulates it. \nHowever, nephrons are very small, and hard to count, so this connection has historically been difficult to verify. Research relies heavily on nephron counts from autopsies . \nBertram's team studied 59 kidneys from 59 individual patients collected at autopsy, and, he said, found a clear correlation between nephron count and hypertension. \n\"This paper, the first such study in an Asian population, shows that Japanese with hypertension have significantly fewer nephrons than normotensive Japanese do - it's a clear-cut finding,\" Bertram said . \nThe research team found Japanese people without hypertension or kidney disease had 640,000 nephrons, compared to the European average of 900,000 to one million. This figure dropped to 392,000 if the person had hypertension and 268,000 if they had chronic kidney disease. \n\"In the present study, 9 Japanese hypertensive subjects with a mean age of 68 years had 37 percent fewer nephrons than 9 normotensive subjects with a mean age of 64 years,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. \nPrevious research led by Bertram has found a correlation between low nephron count and low birth weight. He has also conducted research that has found higher rates of low birthrate, low nephron counts, and higher rates of hypertension and kidney disease in African American and Australian Aboriginal populations. \nPre-term and low weight births have risen in Japan over the last three decades, and Go Kanzaki from Jikei University said the results have implications for the future. \n\"There is a trend towards Japanese women staying thin and small during pregnancy to try to look beautiful but their babies are more likely to be born smaller and with smaller kidneys and therefore less nephrons - the number of nephrons is set at birth,\" he said . \nIt's worth noting that while research supports this trend, the reasons for it may be slightly more serious than female vanity. \n\"Japan recommends stricter limiting of weight gain during pregnancy, compared to other developed countries,\" researchers wrote in a 2016 paper published in Scientific Reports . \n\"In this context, pregnant Japanese women are expected to weigh themselves at every perinatal check-up ... Moreover, the majority of Japanese women believe that carrying a smaller baby would ensure a smooth delivery, which can lead them to avoid extra weight gain during their pregnancy.\" \nBut if a safe method of counting nephrons could be devised for living patients, it could also help predict high blood pressure and chronic kidney disease before they became a problem. \n\"Ultimately,\" Bertram said , \"you would hope that health professionals will think more about low birth weight although the idea's not there yet.\" \nThe research has been published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T17:26:28.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de9489459dacdc0ca8d6d6f5edb99cf494711e8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGX63dUaCz7EitlG36uLV8G5Z3ZEypORfvbHavrVj3HdOoui1RHgxgh73X9AeuCD907DB_PpN1ogZd1qJneRQpLxvJUrOGCCJXx28eMyantMDBIX1Rq.ld6w--", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "New Neanderthal Gene Analysis Shows We Have More of Their DNA Than Expected", "title_full": "New Neanderthal Gene Analysis Shows We Have More of Their DNA Than Expected", "published": "2017-10-05T13:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/neanderthal_ancestor_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de9489459dacdc0ca8d6d6f5edb99cf494711e8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGX63dUaCz7EitlG36uLV8G5Z3ZEypORfvbHavrVj3HdOoui1RHgxgh73X9AeuCD907DB_PpN1ogZd1qJneRQpLxvJUrOGCCJXx28eMyantMDBIX1Rq.ld6w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike McRae", "published": "2017-10-05T13:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Neanderthal Gene Analysis Shows We Have More of Their DNA Than Expected", "text": "New Neanderthal Gene Analysis Shows We Have More of Their DNA Than Expected \nWe're definitely part-Neanderthal. 5 OCT 2017 \nA 52,000 year old splinter of bone uncovered in a Croatian cave has provided researchers with new insights into our connections to our closest extinct cousins, the Neanderthals. \nThe specimen was analysed to provide a rare example of a near complete Neanderthal genome, helping confirm several hypotheses on their evolution while forcing us to reconsider how much of our close cousin's genome we share. \nDecoding Neanderthal DNA almost feels like old news. In 2010 researchers drilled into 44 small bones uncovered in Vindija cave in Croatia's far north, in search of Neanderthal DNA. \nThey came away with the first complete sequence of a Neanderthal genome, setting a landmark event in genetics and the study of human history. \nMore success in 2014 in the Altai Mountains of Siberia, with an even better 122,000 year old specimen providing a complete sequence of a Neanderthal woman. From her genome researchers compared the relationships between modern humans, Neanderthals, and another of our close cousins called the Denisovans. \nThe Altai specimen's genes also suggested as much as 2.1 percent of the DNA in modern Europeans and Asians could have come from great-grandpa and great-grandma Neanderthal. \nAs significant as these discoveries were, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology wanted to know if improvements in technology might help them get more from the Vindija bones, sending them back to the specimens for fresh samples. \nOne bone \u2013 code named Vindija 33.19 \u2013 proved to be a treasure trove. \nStitching together the jigsaw puzzle of DNA fragments they managed to sequence, the researchers were able to construct a second complete, quality Neanderthal genome from a single individual. \nWith the sum of research combined, anthropologists now have a clearer picture on the age-old love affair between Neanderthals and the direct ancestors of today's European and Asian populations. Similar to what was revealed in previous studies, Vindija 33.19 came from a population that was about 3,000 in size. \nThe Altai genome contained hints that the parents were half-siblings, raising questions on how incestuous Neanderthals might have been. Yet Vindija 33.19 shows no sign of her parents being closely related. \nLiving in Europe nearer to the time when humans were first venturing out of Africa, her DNA provides us with a stronger indication of what kinds of genes they shared with modern human groups. \nIt turns out European and Asian DNA could be as much as 2.6 percent Neanderthal. \nThe study also provided evidence of Neanderthals and modern human ancestors mingling between 130,000 and 145,000 years ago, before the Croatian and Siberian Neanderthals split up. \nThat puts it more in line with evidence pulled from scraps of DNA extracted from a Neanderthal leg bone that suggested humans were already venturing into Europe about 124,000 years ago. \nThe kinds of genes Vindija 33.19's relatives passed our way have an effect on things like our blood cholesterol levels, various eating disorders, the accumulation of fat around our gut, responses to antipsychotic drugs, and our development of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia. \nA separate study , also conducted by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, recently found Neanderthal genes in modern humans could also influence our skin tone and hair colour, sleep patterns, our moods, and even our risk of nicotine addiction. \nWith future advances in extraction and sequencing technology, and possible new discoveries, it's almost certain the rough numbers we have describing our occasional Neanderthal booty calls will continue to be fine-tuned, providing deeper insights into our shared heritage. \nFor tens of thousands of years our stocky cousins wandered the continent, adapting to new climates and settling in exotic new lands. It's been about 30,000 years since the last of the Neanderthals passed away. \nThe Neanderthals might be long gone, but their legacy lives on in many of us today. \nThis research was published in Science .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:06:36.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f5288f53e77f3d2fa0592e1ca46b6726281a299", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGX63dUaCz7EgZHe_Ivyh3vqNiX3ZnsjdI7Af1LutuLDJ7AyqdpJjckAhZq33abEj8pfyeBnl9v9fZbC76DlCiVh87o9t9_iKYg9gVBubVJ_Q-", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "Awesome New Method Can Pull Hydrogen Fuel From Seawater Using Only Sunshine", "title_full": "Awesome New Method Can Pull Hydrogen Fuel From Seawater Using Only Sunshine", "published": "2017-10-05T18:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/hydrogen-fuel-from-ocean-water-tim-marshall-unsplash_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f5288f53e77f3d2fa0592e1ca46b6726281a299", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGX63dUaCz7EgZHe_Ivyh3vqNiX3ZnsjdI7Af1LutuLDJ7AyqdpJjckAhZq33abEj8pfyeBnl9v9fZbC76DlCiVh87o9t9_iKYg9gVBubVJ_Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Nield", "published": "2017-10-05T18:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Awesome New Method Can Pull Hydrogen Fuel From Seawater Using Only Sunshine", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. Tim Marshall / Unsplash Awesome New Method Can Pull Hydrogen Fuel From Seawater Using Only Sunshine \nFossil fuels, get in the bin. DAVID NIELD 5 OCT 2017 \nA newly developed nanomaterial can release hydrogen from seawater much more cheaply and efficiently than existing methods, potentially giving us another way of unlocking this most sustainable of energy sources. \nFinding a way to produce hydrogen from water that isn't prohibitively costly in price and energy could significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. \nAnd the team from the University of Central Florida say the new extraction method is particularly well suited to their home state, with an abundance of both sunshine and seawater \u2013 the two natural elements that make the whole process tick. \n\"We've opened a new window to splitting real water, not just purified water in a lab,\" says senior researcher Yang Yang , who has been working on this type of technology for a decade. \"This really works well in seawater.\" \nPut a hydrogen fuel cell in your car , and the only waste product is water, which can be turned back into hydrogen and oxygen \u2013 it's a truly sustainable, clean, and environmentally friendly way of providing power. \nThe problem is producing hydrogen, from water or another source, in a cost-effective way that doesn't cost more energy and create more carbon than it saves. It's a puzzle that teams of scientists across the world are trying to solve . \nAnd scientists have looked at getting hydrogen from seawater before \u2013 it can be done, but it uses a lot of electricity. The qualities of the water in the oceans, including the salt in it, make the process particularly tricky. \nFor this study, Yang and his team developed a new nanomaterial to act as a photocatalyst, spurring the chemical reaction that occurs when light hits a surface: in this case, producing hydrogen gas from water. \nCrucially, the nanomaterial captures a broader spectrum of light than other materials, so it can use more of the Sun's energy. It also is specially designed to stand up to the harsh conditions found in seawater. \nThe hybrid material is based on titanium dioxide, the most common photocatalyst, but it's etched with microscopic nanocavities coated with a compound called molybdenum disulfide . \nThat's the magic formula that makes the release of hydrogen much more efficient, at a reasonable cost. The researchers say it's at least twice as efficient as current photocatalysts. \nThere's still quite a way to go with this technology, which needs to be scaled up and commercialised if it's going to give us a hydrogen-fuelled future, but the early tests run by the researchers show promising results. \nAs an added bonus, using sunlight directly rather than using electricity from solar panels means there's no need to store electricity in batteries. The hydrogen gas can be stored and transported instead, which is easier to do. \n\"We can absorb much more solar energy from the light than the conventional material,\" says Yang . \"Eventually, if it is commercialised, it would be good for Florida's economy.\" \nThe research has been published in Energy & Environmental Science .

All rights reserved. Photographee.eu/Shutterstock Schizophrenia Is 80% Genetic, According to This Massive New Study on Twins \nMost accurate results so far. MIKE MCRAE 6 OCT 2017 \nAs many as four out of five cases of schizophrenia can be traced back to genes inherited from the child's parents. \nBy applying a new statistical approach to data collected on more than 30,000 pairs of twins, researchers have produced the most accurate figures to date on risk factors for the condition, potentially helping us identify the genes responsible for its symptoms. \nScientists from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, dipped into a pool of information collected through their national Danish Twin Register and combined it with data from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register to come up with a whopping sample of 31,524 twin pairs, all born between 1951 and 2000. \nTwins are a fairly solid way to determine whether a condition was inherited at conception or is the result of other environmental factors. \nSo-called identical twins \u2013 or monozygotic twin pairs \u2013 inherited the same sets of genes from their parents. \nComparing characteristics found among them with those in dizygotic twin pairs (or non-identical twins) can provide a strong indication of whether it was caused by genes or something in the environment as they developed. \nWhile this is good in theory, biology is a messy affair where lots of numbers are needed to come to a reliable conclusion. It can be challenging finding enough twins with the condition being studied to participate in a study. \nIn the case of schizophrenia, the neurological condition affects just under 5 out of every 1,000 individuals at any given point in time, making it especially difficult in collecting enough data on twins. \nThus, Denmark's big national register combined with sharp statistical tools has turned out to be an excellent way to go. \nA similar twins study conducted in Finland in 1998 using a smaller sample from their Finnish National Population Register concluded heritability of schizophrenia to be 83 percent. \nAnother analysis conducted in Sweden in 2007 broke the risk down between the sexes, finding genes to be the cause of schizophrenia in 67 percent of female cases and 41 percent in male. \nThese numbers aren't helped at all by the fact that schizophrenia itself is a disputed condition . Like autism in days past, the word attempts to cover a broad spectrum of causes and symptoms that needs to be better labelled or split up altogether. \nIn an attempt to get a better grip on the statistics, the researchers in this latest study calculated two estimates, on both a narrow definition and a broader schizophrenia 'spectrum' disorder. \nFor the more narrow definition they estimated genes determined the condition's diagnosis in 79 percent of total cases. \nWhen expanded to include those with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, the number dropped to 73 percent. \n\"This study is now the most comprehensive and thorough estimate of the heritability of schizophrenia and its diagnostic diversity,\" says researcher Rikke Hilker from the University of Copenhagen. \n\"It is interesting since it indicates that the genetic risk for disease seems to be of almost equal importance across the spectrum of schizophrenia.\" \nThe research also provided an average age of 28.9 at which the symptoms of schizophrenia become significant enough for a diagnosis. \nTwin studies are useful tools, but are based on the fair assumption that twins reflect the same inheritance patterns of the general population. \nThere is also the question of how much each national database can be generalised to other parts of the world. \nThe tug-of-war debate of nature versus nurture often hides the complexity of disease and disability. \nEven the inheritance of a gene can be complicated by the editing effects of epigenetics, or so-called post-zygotic mosaic mutations that take place shortly after conception. \nIndividual genes have been linked with schizophrenia in the past, and based on this study's results there are almost certainly more to be discovered in the future. \nThe boundaries and definitions of this serious mental condition might shift around, but no matter what we call it, those who suffer from schizophrenia's debilitating effects will benefit from knowing more about its underlying causes. \nThis research was published in Biological Psychiatry .

And now DNA analysis points to an explanation for these frustrating efforts, and it's bad news for the bird's entire species. \nThis weird story starts with a family of brightly-coloured, medium-sized songbirds that tweet all across Africa and Asia. Collectively known as bulbuls and greenbuls, they comprise approximately 130 species. \nOne of those species is a yellowish-green bird called the icterine greenbul ( Phyllastrephus icterinus ), a cute forest-dweller common across the entire western and central Africa. \nIn the early 1980s, German ornithologist Wulf Gatter came across a similar-looking species in the Cavalla Forest in eastern Liberia. It had unique colouring for any other greenbul - the tail was paler, the wings darker, and there were broad white spots at the tips of all the wing feathers. \nCollinson et al., J Ornithol (2017) \nGatter saw the bird demonstrating its wing spots in a way that appeared different from the similar icterine greenbuls hanging out nearby. \nAfter glimpsing these birds across nine occasions, he finally collected one specimen in 1984 and described it as new to science , naming the bird the Liberian greenbul ( Phyllastrephus leucolepis ). \nThen, nobody saw it again for decades. \nPartly, this was because of the civil wars ravaging the country in the 90s and early 2000s, which prevented new ornithology expeditions doing additional sightings to learn more about the species. \nAnd partly, it was probably because there was nothing to be found. \nAfter two targeted search missions in 2010 and 2013 that yielded no additional specimens, an international ornithologist team changed their tactic and turned to DNA analysis. \nNow, these researchers from the UK and Germany - including Gatter himself - have published their results. According to the data, the most likely explanation for a lack of new Liberian greenbuls is the fact that they don't actually exist. \nTwo independent teams ran analysis on DNA samples from the sole Liberian greenbul specimen and two other greenbul species - the icterine and the white-throated greenbul. \nIn the end, the Liberian and icterine greenbuls turned out to share an astonishing amount of genetic similarities, much more than any other two species of greenbul. \n\"The genetic work was performed independently by scientists here in Aberdeen and in Dresden to make sure there could be no error - we both came to the same conclusion,\" says geneticist Martin Collinson from the University of Aberdeen. \n\"We can't say definitively that the Liberian greenbul is the same bird as the icterine greenbul, but we have presented enough evidence that makes any other explanation seem highly unlikely.\" \nAnd it's not like the purported new species was even a hybrid - analysis also excluded that probability, leaving the researchers to hypothesise that the 'Liberian' greenbul was just an icterine greenbul with a juvenile nutritional deficiency that caused changes to its plumage. \nBummer. \nBut despite the thorough genetic analysis and unlikely alternative explanations, we can't yet say that the elusive birds absolutely, definitely don't exist - it looks like once something becomes a species, unspecying it is a tougher ask. \n\"Formal resolution of the status of the Liberian greenbul will not be possible until either a population of [them] is rediscovered or alternatively shown not to exist,\" the team writes in the study. \nThe spotted birds certainly don't live in their original location any more, but it's possible they have migrated to another area due to deforestation. \nOr\u2026 you know, they really don't exist. \nThe research was published in the Journal of Ornithology .

All rights reserved. Atthapon Raksthaput/Shutterstock Here Are The Top 10 Most Unnecessary Medical Treatments, According to Scientists \nWay too much of a good thing! MIKE MCRAE 6 OCT 2017 \nA recent literature study on medical care in the US has put forward ten diagnostic procedures and treatments that were overused in 2016, with the intention of highlighting ways that the medical system could be made more effective and more efficient. \nMedicine is often a numbers game. While doctors do a smashing job with limited resources, sometimes striking a balance between time and costs means pills and procedures get prescribed without the patient's best interests in mind. \n\"Too often, health care practitioners do not rely on the latest evidence and their patients don't get the best care,\" says researcher Daniel Morgan from the University of Maryland's School of Medicine. \n\"Hopefully this study will spread the word about the most overused tests and treatments.\" \nThe team dug through journal articles in the PubMed archive, using search terms such as overuse, overtreatment, inappropriate, and unnecessary. \nThe team considered 2,252 papers, of which 1,224 addressed the overuse of medicine directly. \nSpecifically, the papers reported on \"care in which potential harms outweigh potential benefits.\" \nThese were further whittled to 122 papers which were identified as significant. The researchers then agreed on their following 'top ten'. \nTransesophageal echocardiography \nIn simple terms, this procedure takes pictures of your heart using ultrasound via a tube inserted into your oesophagus. A doctor might use this instead of doing an electrocardiogram, but research suggests any extra detail it might produce isn't worth the risks of being sedated. \nComputed tomography pulmonary angiography \nA diagnostic test that images the pulmonary arteries in patients with respiratory symptoms using a CT scan. It isn't invasive, and is highly sensitive, but hits the patient with a dose of radiation. The wait for this test is likely to result in delays that raise the risk of complications developing. \nComputed tomography in any patients with respiratory symptoms \nAny kind of CT scan on a patient with non-life threatening respiratory symptoms, according to the study, does little to improve the patient's outcome. Worse still, these scans raise risks of false positives, where the test indicates a non-existent pathology. \nCarotid artery ultrasonography and stenting \nCarotid ultrasounds are done to test the width of arteries at the neck, which could help indicate risk of stroke. \nEarly diagnosis can be a life saver, but the researchers found 9 out of 10 tests being done on asymptomatic patients that resulted in an artery-widening 'stent' being inserted were done on inappropriate grounds. \nSince stents require surgery, it's likely a number of these are inflating risk unnecessarily. \nAggressive management of prostate cancer \nProstate cancer is another condition that can be treated easily if found early. \nA blood test for markers called prostate antigens can do that, but it's hard to tell if they're produced by an aggressive tumour that needs to be dealt with or a slow growing one that the patient can take to their grave in years to come. \nJust 1 percent of men who had their prostate removed \u2013 risking the complications that go with that \u2013 died of the cancer. Of those who kept their prostate? About the same. \nSupplemental oxygen for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \nGiving more oxygen to patients with the lung illness COPD didn't help their lungs work better or improve their wellbeing. But it can cause them to retain carbon dioxide . Which isn't good. \nSurgery for meniscal cartilage tears \nRipping the C-shaped shock-absorbing discs of cartilage inside your knee is no laughing matter. But going to the trouble of repairing it surgically was found to have few benefits that couldn't be achieved through conservative management and rehabilitation. \nNutritional support in medical inpatients \nOverall, malnutrition doesn't do a patient much good. On the other hand, giving nutritional support to critically ill patients made no difference in terms of hospital stay or mortality, even if it helped them put on weight. \nIn the event of failing organs or metabolic complications , that support might carry risks that aren't balanced by benefits. \nUse of antibiotics \nA 2016 study estimated 506 prescriptions were being written in 2010 to 2011 for every 1000 people. Only 353 could be considered appropriate. \nThe CDC's National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria aims to reduce inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50 percent within the next few years. \nThe researchers noted that of the measures in this plan, the most effective was to use social pressures, encouraging doctors to take note of good prescription practices among their colleagues. \nUse of cardiac imaging \nCardiac imaging for patients with chest pain was found to have tripled over the past decade, while doing nothing for low-risk patients. This risks leading to unnecessary hospital stays and interventions. \nThe solution? According to the researchers, doctors should share decision making with their patient. \nNone of these results should be taken to mean these tests and procedures are to be avoided. We're not medical professionals at ScienceAlert, so our best advice is \u2013 as always \u2013 don't be afraid to ask your doctor. \nResearch that takes a critical look at how professionals deliver medical care is important for maintaining high standards with available resources. \nThis research was published in JAMA Internal Medicine .

All rights reserved. G.E. Marti/JILA New 3D Quantum Gas Atomic Clock Keeps The Most Precise Time Ever Far out. 6 OCT 2017 A new atomic clock has extended from one dimension to three, becoming the most precise timekeeper in existence - just 3.5 parts error in 10 quintillion (that's 1 followed by 19 zeroes) in two hours. \nThe clock was built by JILA , a collaboration between the University of Colorado and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which also built the world's previous record holder for the most precise clock in 2015. \nIt had a precision of 2 parts error in 1 quintillion (18 zeroes), and could keep time without losing or gaining a second for 15 billion years - longer than the age of the universe . \n\"We are entering a really exciting time when we can quantum engineer a state of matter for a particular measurement purpose,\" said NIST physicist Jun Ye . \nThe 2015 atomic clock was based on a one-dimensional lattice of strontium atoms, held in place by laser beams. \nThe new clock has expanded this lattice out to a tiny 3D cube, and packed gas at 1,000 times the density of previous, one-dimensional atomic clocks. \nAtomic clocks keep time based on the behaviour of the electrons around the atoms of this gas when exposed to radiation. They jump back and forth between two energy states with very fine precision. \nThe frequency of this electron transition is the basis for atomic clocks' timekeeping. \nIn one-dimensional atomic clocks, each atom is measured independently, because when they interact with each other, it can cause inaccuracies. \nIn a cube, though, the gas becomes a globally interacting collection of atoms that move in a pattern to avoid each other, called a \"quantum many-body system\", minimising collisions and vastly improving accuracy. \nThe gas makes a difference too. For the first time in an atomic clock, the team used something called Fermi gas, or \"quantum gas\", a phase of matter that contains a large number of fermions. \nUnlike the thermal gases traditionally used in atomic clocks, this Fermi gas allows all the atoms' properties to be restricted for the first time. \nThese properties mean the clock will be able to be scaled up. \n\"The most important potential of the 3-D quantum gas clock is the ability to scale up the atom numbers, which will lead to a huge gain in stability,\" Ye said. \n\"Also, we could reach the ideal condition of running the clock with its full coherence time, which refers to how long a series of ticks can remain stable. The ability to scale up both the atom number and coherence time will make this new-generation clock qualitatively different from the previous generation.\" \nAnd it can reach the same precision as previous atomic clocks 20 times faster, maintaining stable ticks for 10 seconds with 10,000 strontium atoms packed in at a density greater than 10 trillion atoms per cubic centimetre. \n\"This represents a significant improvement over any previous demonstrations,\" Ye said. \nAccurate timekeeping isn't just important for making sure you get to the doctor on time. It's vital to science. An incredibly precise atomic clock is able to help with both timekeeping and navigation for research purposes. \nIt can also help define and refine time measurements. \"One mississippi\" works for hide-and-seek, but the accuracy provided by atomic clocks has codified the standard second. \nAnd atomic clocks are a fascinating tool in the search for dark matter. \nWhen atomic clocks interact with dark matter, they can speed up or slow down - but by absolutely miniscule fractions of a second. Synchronised atomic clocks can make these discrepancies detectable in a way that other clocks cannot. \n\"This new strontium clock using a quantum gas is an early and astounding success in the practical application of the 'new quantum revolution,' sometimes called 'quantum 2.0',\" said Thomas O'Brian , Ye's supervisor. \n\"This approach holds enormous promise for NIST and JILA to harness quantum correlations for a broad range of measurements and new technologies, far beyond timing.\" \nThe team's research has been published in the journal Science .

JAMA Pediatrics Clinical Challenge A Strict Diet of Potato, Meat And Cereal Made a Boy Go Blind \nBrb, buying carrots. 4 OCT 2017 There may not be much truth to the old folk wisdom that carrots make your eyesight better, but it turns out that not eating your veg will almost certainly make it worse. Doctors have described the case of an 11-year-old boy who presented to their clinic in Canada with severe vision loss, due to a highly restrictive diet. The culprit? A lack of vitamin A. \nHe'd gone to the hospital after eight months of increasing problems. Dry eyes, night blindness, sensitivity to light and increasing vision loss, to the point of severity: by the time he visited The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, he could only see hand movements a maximum of 30 centimetres (12 inches) from his face. \nThe difficulty arose because he also suffered from eczema and multiple food allergies, which meant that his diet was highly restricted. \n\"Owing to concerns about food triggers of his eczema, the child had a restrictive diet consisting solely of potato, pork, lamb, apples, cucumber, and Cheerios,\" the doctors wrote in their case report. \nNone of these food items are particularly high in vitamin A, which, as it turns out, is super important for your vision. The photoreceptor cells in your eyes rely on vitamin A to detect light , and the vitamin also keeps the cornea moist and protected. \nThe patient's eyes were extremely dry, and had keratinised patches with a dry foamy appearance. These are called Bitot's spots , and are a typical symptom of vitamin A deficiency. \nWhen the doctors tested the boy, his vitamin A levels were severely low - 14.33 micrograms per decilitre. A normal range is 25.79-48.71 micrograms per decilitre. \n\"Vitamin A deficiency is generally thought of as a disease that primarily affects people in low resource environments, such as countries in the developing world, where food choices are limited and malnutrition is endemic,\" the doctors wrote. \nTo treat the boy, the doctors administered three megadoses of vitamin A of 200,000 international units each. The first two were administered on the first two days after diagnosis respectively, and the third dose took place two weeks later. \nJAMA Pediatrics Clinical Challenge \nAfter six weeks, the boy's vision had improved to 20/800 in both eyes, and the dryness and Bitot's spots had cleared up, as seen in the image above. However, 20/800 still fits into the legally blind category if it cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 with glasses or contact lenses. \nAnd he may never fully heal. \n\"Vision loss associated with vitamin A deficiency can be reversible; however, in cases with established optic atrophy, as was the case in this patient, a degree of vision loss is likely permanent,\" the doctors wrote. \n\"This patient illustrates the importance of considering micronutrient deficiencies in high-resource settings, particularly in persons for which a diet rich in various food sources is not evident, such as children with highly restrictive diets.\" \nWe're not medical advisors, but if you want to avoid this fate for yourself or your children, it's probably a good idea to ensure that foods rich in vitamin A are part of your diet. This includes foods like liver, kidney, eggs, leafy green vegetables, sweet potatoes, and, yes, carrots. \nThe case report was published online in the journal JAMA Pediatrics Clinical Challenge .

NASA/JPL-Caltech That 'Alien Megastructure' Star Has Turned Out to Be Even Weirder Than We Knew Well that's just great \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af MICHELLE STARR 6 OCT 2017 Mysterious star KIC 8462852 that has been confounding astronomers since its 2015 discovery is continuing to do so, as spectacularly as only KIC 8462852 can. \nAccording to all-sky survey records examined by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, the star exhibited strange behaviour over 10 years ago, too - which means current theories about it just had a massive spanner thrown in the works. \nKIC 8462852 , around 1,500 light-years away, is also known as Tabby's Star or Boyajian's Star after Tabetha Boyajian, the Yale astronomer who first brought the star's unusual behaviour to light in 2015. She noticed that the star's light was dimming very strangely. \nThe Kepler telescope spends its days looking for dimming stars - a dimming pattern is how we find exoplanets. When a planet passes between us and its host star as it orbits, the light of the star dims from our perspective. \nExoplanet dimming is regular and periodic and limited. But KIC 8462852's dimming is irregular, and the amount it dims varies. Its most recent dimming occurred in September this year, dropping 3 percent, but it has also been observed dropping by 22 percent . There is no discernible pattern to the star's fluctuations in brightness. \nKIC 8462852 also seems to have been on a very slow fade, dimming gradually over time. Yet an analysis that included a century's worth of data found that this was not the case, and now the Carnegie researchers have found something else: KIC 8462852 has significantly brightened in the past, too. \nResearchers examined 11 years worth of data from All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) and about 2 years worth of more recent data from the high-precision All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). \nThey found that the star has, in fact, been dimming since February 2015, and is now 1.5 percent dimmer than it was then. \nBut they also found that the star had two periods of significant brightening, one in 2007 and another in 2014. \n\"Up until this work, we had thought that the star's changes in brightness were only occurring in one direction - dimming,\" researcher Josh Simon explained . \"The realisation that the star sometimes gets brighter in addition to periods of dimming is incompatible with most hypotheses to explain its weird behaviour.\" \nThese theories include a ringed planet passing in front of the star, either absolutely enormous or a smaller one with an orbital wobble ; a swarm of comets ; space junk ; aliens (???); the star swallowing a planet ; something happening inside the star itself ; and the scientific equivalent of a shrug emoji . \nNew research led by Huan Meng of the University of Arizona, published in The Astrophysical Journal , just proposed that the dimming may actually be due to an irregular cloud of dust - because there's less dimming in the infrared light than the ultraviolet light, and anything larger than dust would block all light. \n\"This pretty much rules out the alien megastructure theory, as that could not explain the wavelength-dependent dimming,\" Meng said . \"We suspect, instead, there is a cloud of dust orbiting the star with a roughly 700-day orbital period.\" \nIf it is dust, the star will get redder when it dims, which would be consistent with the dust theory, so that's what Carnegie co-researcher Benjamin Shappee believes the next step should be. \n\"That information would help narrow down the possible explanations for why this star is doing such strange things,\" he said . \nYou can follow the quest to understand Tabby's Star on the Twitter hashtag #TabbysStar . \nSimon and Shappe have submitted their research for publication in AAS Journals, and it can be read online at preprint resource arXiv .

During the 2011 Draconid shower, more than 600 meteors per hour were visible in the sky, despite a bright Moon at the time. \nWhile we're not guaranteed to see such a spectacular show this year, it's worth heading out with a blanket and a hot chocolate to check it out, because you never know when the shower will become a storm. \nSo how do you watch? Viewing is best in the northern hemisphere and in the higher latitudes, so unfortunately the Draconids won't be visible for everyone. \nBut the good news is that this is one of the few meteor showers that you don't have to stay up too late for. \nWhile most meteor showers are best viewed just before dawn, the Draconids are best viewed from just after sunset to midnight, so it's perfect for your weekend evening plans. \nAccording to EarthSky , here's the best way to watch: \nSpend an hour or more under a dark and open sky, lying down and with your feet pointing northward. Oftentimes, this hard-to-predict shower doesn't offer much more than a handful of languid meteors per hour .. But you never know for sure with the Draconids, so it's worth watching out for on the evening of October 7 and 8. \nThe meteor shower radiates from the northern constellation Draco the Dragon (hence its name). Because it originates so far north in our night sky, people living in northern US, Canada, Europe, and Northern Asia will have the best shot of seeing meteors. \nUnfortunately, the Moon is waning gibbous at the moment, which means it rises pretty early in the evening, so get out as close to sunset as you can before the Moon rises to catch the skies while they're still dark.

These basalt plains, called maria, were formed when plumes of magma from inside the Moon erupted to the surface, creating lava flows. \nAstronauts from the Apollo missions brought back samples from the maria to Earth, and we now know that the lava flows contained carbon monoxide and other gas components, sulfur, and even the building blocks of water. \nOur Moon has no atmosphere now, as it lacks a strong enough magnetic field and sufficient mass to hold an atmosphere around it. \nUnlike Earth , which has sufficient mass and magnetism to hang on to an atmosphere, any atmosphere around the Moon would quickly be stripped away by solar winds. \nHowever, the new research indicates that the Moon did briefly have an atmosphere before that happened. \nThe team used the samples to calculate how much gas rose and accumulated to form the transient atmosphere. They found that the volcanic activity peaked about 3.5 billion years ago, which was when the atmosphere was at its thickest. \nOnce it formed, it persisted for around 70 million years before it was stripped away and lost in space. During the period when the Moon had an atmosphere, it was almost three times closer to Earth, and therefore would have appeared much bigger in the sky. \nUniversities Space Research Association (USRA) Senior Staff Scientist David Kring told Phys.org : \"This work dramatically changes our view of the Moon from an airless rocky body to one that used to be surrounded by an atmosphere more prevalent than that surrounding Mars today.\" \nThis new information has important implications for future astronauts, planned lunar missions and space exploration. \nThe research suggests that volatiles from the atmosphere may have been trapped near the lunar poles in cold, permanently shadowed areas. \nIf this is true, there may already be a source of ice on the Moon that astronauts and colonists can use for drinking water, growing food, and other needs. \nIcy deposits stocked with captured volatiles could also provide fuel and air for both lunar surface operations and even missions beyond the Moon. \nAnd whatever already exists on the Moon won't need to be ported from Earth \u2014 a tremendous advantage given the expense of carrying cargo into space. \nThis article was originally published by Futurism.

All rights reserved. Elvis Popovic This Overlooked Theory Could Be The Missing Piece That Explains How The EM Drive Works \nWhat if it doesn't break the laws of physics? FIONA MACDONALD 7 OCT 2017 \nEver since the EM drive first made headlines , science lovers have puzzled over how the propulsion system seems to produce thrust , despite the fact it's 'impossible' according to one of the most fundamental laws of physics - Newton's third law of motion. \nNow a team of physicists have put forward an alternative explanation - it turns out the EM drive could actually work without breaking any scientific laws, if we factor in a weird and often overlooked idea in quantum physics - pilot wave theory . \nFor those who need a refresher, the crux of the problem here is that the EM, or electromagnetic, drive appears to produce thrust without any fuel or propellant. \nThat's awesome because it means we can get to space with way less pay load - it's proposed it could even get us to Mars within 72 days . \nBut it's also perplexing, because, according to Newton's third law, every action must have an equal and opposite reaction. So without pushing any propellant out one end, the drive shouldn't be able to produce thrust in the opposite direction. \nStill, as a NASA peer-reviewed paper showed last year , the drive does produce thrust, at least as far as we can currently tell. And a relatively large amount of thrust at that. We just don't know how. \nSo either our understanding of physics isn't right, or we're missing a big piece of the puzzle when it comes to the EM drive. \nA new paper published in The Journal of Applied Physical Science International makes the argument that what we're missing is pilot wave theory - a slightly controversial alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics. \nResearchers Jos\u00e9 Croca and Paulo Castro from the Centre for Philosophy of Sciences of the University of Lisbon in Portugal suggest that not only could pilot wave theory explain the mysterious behaviour of the EM drive, it could help to make it even more powerful. \n\"We have found that applying a pilot wave theory to NASA's EM drive frustum [or cone], we could explain its thrust without involving any external action applied to the system, as Newton's third law would require,\" Castro told ScienceAlert via email. \nSo what is pilot wave theory? Currently, the majority of physicists subscribe to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which states that particles do not have defined locations until they are observed. \nPilot wave theory, on the other hand, suggests that particles do have precise positions at all times, but in order for this to be the case, the world must also be strange in other ways \u2013 which is why many physicists have dismissed the idea. \nBut in recent years, the pilot wave theory has been increasing in popularity . The team has shown in its latest paper this theory could be tweaked slightly to apply to something bigger. Say, the EM drive. And it could explain the results we've been seeing. \nBasically, pilot wave theory says that an object radiates a wave field, and it is then pulled or attracted to regions of that field that have higher intensity or energy density. In that way, the wave field is actually 'piloting' the object, hence the name. \nThrough modelling, the team showed that a sufficiently strong and asymmetrical electromagnetic field could act as a pilot wave. And that's exactly what the EM drive generates. \nBecause the cone, or frustum, of the EM drive is asymmetrical, it would also generate an asymmetrical wave field. As a result, the walls of the EM drive would move towards the areas of higher intensity, creating thrust. \nWhile that might sound pretty out there, this was also actually a possible solution put forward by the NASA Eagleworks researchers in their seminal paper last year where they first reported the thrust generated by their device: \n\"[The] supporting physics model used to derive a force based on operating conditions in the test article can be categorised as a nonlocal hidden-variable theory, or pilot-wave theory for short.\" \nTo be clear, the researchers from the University of Lisbon haven't tested their proposal in a real device as yet. \nThey've only shown that it's possible, from a modelling point of view, for a pilot wave to guide the EM drive. But they've also shown how the idea could actually be tested in future. \n\"At the moment the most stringent empirical evidence comes from the EM drive behaviour,\" Castro told ScienceAlert. \"However, we have also devised an experiment to detect and modulate subquantum waves.\" \nImportantly, if the hypothesis is confirmed, it would mean the EM drive would not have to break Newton's third law. And the team hopes this might result in the device being taken seriously and more widely tested. \"EM drive is the future of space propelling motors,\" they said. \"[Although] it will perhaps find its initial application in nano satellites or nano drones, at least before the effect can be scaled up to heavier machines.\" \nImportantly, if a pilot wave does explain the thrust behind the device, then it could also lead to a way to make the propulsion system even more powerful in future, and it's as simple as tweaking the shape. \"We have seen that the effect could be enhanced using a different shape for the frustum,\" said Castro. \"In fact a trumpet exponential form is expected to increase the thrust.\" The team is now considering building its own experimental set up to study the phenomena and has invited anyone interested in the project to get in touch . In the meantime, the NASA Eagleworks team continues to test out its device. And there are also groups looking to test the EM drive in space - or according to some rumours, already doing so - which would really show once and for all whether it works. \nThere's a lot we have yet to learn about the mysterious EM drive and it's a topic that continues to divide the science world. But whether or not it ends up being the future of space travel, at least it's teaching us more about the physics that govern our world. \nThe new research has been published in The Journal of Applied Physical Science International .

All rights reserved. UCLA Health A 4-Year-Old Boy Has Inspired a Crazy New Organ Donation System, And It's Already Saving Lives \nAlmost 70 people are alive because of the new system. PETER DOCKRILL 1 OCT 2017 \nWhen retired judge Howard Broadman realised his four-year-old grandson would one day need a life-saving kidney transplant, he realised he had to do something. \nThe problem was, by the time his young grandson, Quinn, could receive a transplant, Broadman would be too old to donate his own kidney. So he came up with a unique workaround, which researchers say has now helped save the lives of almost 70 people. \nIt wasn't a complex idea he came up with, but was in fact quite brilliant in its simplicity. \nIn 2014, Broadman, then 64, approached physicians at the UCLA Kidney Transplant Program and made them a one-of-a-kind request: if he were to donate one of his kidneys to a stranger who needed it immediately, could Quinn receive a 'voucher' for when he needs his own transplant in the future? \nThe doctors Broadman approached were receptive to the idea, and so began a unique kidney donation program that addresses one of the key issues in getting vital organs into the bodies of recipients: when supply and demand don't coincide. \nUCLA Health \n\"Some potential kidney donors are incompatible with their intended recipient based on blood type; others may be incompatible based on time,\" explains urologist Jeffrey Veale from UCLA, the surgeon who performed Broadman's transplant. \n\"The voucher program resolves this time incompatibility between the kidney transplant donor and recipient.\" \nBroadman may have been the first donor to give over one of his kidneys in return for such a voucher, but he certainly wasn't the last. \nIn a new study, Veale reports on how the voucher system \u2013 which has now rolled out to 30 transplant centres across the US \u2013 triggered chains of donations that contributed to 25 successful transplants. \nApproximately one in three patients can't be paired with donated kidneys from friends or family members due to reasons of biological incompatibility. \nWhen this happens, doctors try to match up transplants between donors and recipients that don't know one another but whose physiology looks to be compatible. These transplant queues are called 'chains'. \nBut there's another problem. Sometimes donors might want to hold onto their organs in case a compatible loved one could make use of it later, even if it's not needed now (kind of like Broadman's situation, except his case was further complicated by his age). \nThis is where the voucher system comes in. By encouraging donors to part with their organs right away, it helps get kidneys to patients who require them immediately, removing one of the disincentives to altruistic donation. \nIn return, donors aren't assured a kidney in the future \u2013 as that won't always be practical or possible \u2013 but they do get the next best thing: prioritised matching for their designated recipient with a compatible donor in a future transplant chain. \nVeale's study describes how three initial voucher cases including Broadman's ended up triggering 25 transplants, but the actual impact of the scheme is even greater \u2013 with a total of 21 kidney vouchers so far being given out, leading to 68 transplants once the organ supply chain was freed up. \nIt's an amazing start to the initiative, which the researchers say could ultimately make a huge difference to the lives of the 93,000 people currently awaiting kidney transplants in the US. \n\"If only a fraction of the 40 million chronic kidney disease patients in the US had a donor like Judge Broadman, then tens of thousands of high-quality organs would enter the system,\" Veale told New Scientist . \n\"For the first time in history we could actually start reducing the waiting list.\" \nOne of the patients on that list will be Quinn, who's now seven years old. \nBy the time he's old enough to receive a transplant in several years, hopefully the waiting list will be significantly shorter than it used to be, thanks to his grandfather's bright idea. \nIn any case, he'll have his voucher \u2013 and maybe something else on his side too. \n\"If Quinn had needed the kidney right away, I was going to donate my kidney,\" Broadman explained to CNN . \n\"But once he didn't need it right away, I thought, why not pay it forward and maybe karma would come about.\" \nThe findings are reported in Transplantation .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "veale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter dockrill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howard broadman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey veale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quinn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broadman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ucla health", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla kidney transplant program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new scientist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broadman", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-08T07:25:14.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bbc0edc76c5aafb9ac6d1e7bca2af97fb70a0d17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLvGXlCfDqee9RSUfMw84koaV19CM3dwBQI0Ut1HG7ZQZl6wp_nlaILs5F2jZXn7AZO58NsfxFtBtXmUpwe8HHJaPXeDA6VFIYDujClNvx9llxMYkLNpeqI5ph_JTxt4ew--", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Here are the top 10 most unnecessary medical treatments, according to scientists - ScienceAlert", "title_full": "Here are the top 10 most unnecessary medical treatments, according to scientists - ScienceAlert", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/carotid_ultrasound_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1423, "comments": 0, "shares": 1423}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 6}, "linkedin": {"shares": 352}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bbc0edc76c5aafb9ac6d1e7bca2af97fb70a0d17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLvGXlCfDqee9RSUfMw84koaV19CM3dwBQI0Ut1HG7ZQZl6wp_nlaILs5F2jZXn7AZO58NsfxFtBtXmUpwe8HHJaPXeDA6VFIYDujClNvx9llxMYkLNpeqI5ph_JTxt4ew--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike Mcrae", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here are the top 10 most unnecessary medical treatments, according to scientists - ScienceAlert", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. Atthapon Raksthaput/Shutterstock Here Are The Top 10 Most Unnecessary Medical Treatments, According to Scientists \nWay too much of a good thing! MIKE MCRAE 6 OCT 2017 \nA recent literature study on medical care in the US has put forward ten diagnostic procedures and treatments that were overused in 2016, with the intention of highlighting ways that the medical system could be made more effective and more efficient. \nMedicine is often a numbers game. While doctors do a smashing job with limited resources, sometimes striking a balance between time and costs means pills and procedures get prescribed without the patient's best interests in mind. \n\"Too often, health care practitioners do not rely on the latest evidence and their patients don't get the best care,\" says researcher Daniel Morgan from the University of Maryland's School of Medicine. \n\"Hopefully this study will spread the word about the most overused tests and treatments.\" \nThe team dug through journal articles in the PubMed archive, using search terms such as overuse, overtreatment, inappropriate, and unnecessary. \nThe team considered 2,252 papers, of which 1,224 addressed the overuse of medicine directly. \nSpecifically, the papers reported on \"care in which potential harms outweigh potential benefits.\" \nThese were further whittled to 122 papers which were identified as significant. The researchers then agreed on their following 'top ten'. \nTransesophageal echocardiography \nIn simple terms, this procedure takes pictures of your heart using ultrasound via a tube inserted into your oesophagus. A doctor might use this instead of doing an electrocardiogram, but research suggests any extra detail it might produce isn't worth the risks of being sedated. \nComputed tomography pulmonary angiography \nA diagnostic test that images the pulmonary arteries in patients with respiratory symptoms using a CT scan. It isn't invasive, and is highly sensitive, but hits the patient with a dose of radiation. The wait for this test is likely to result in delays that raise the risk of complications developing. \nComputed tomography in any patients with respiratory symptoms \nAny kind of CT scan on a patient with non-life threatening respiratory symptoms, according to the study, does little to improve the patient's outcome. Worse still, these scans raise risks of false positives, where the test indicates a non-existent pathology. \nCarotid artery ultrasonography and stenting \nCarotid ultrasounds are done to test the width of arteries at the neck, which could help indicate risk of stroke. \nEarly diagnosis can be a life saver, but the researchers found 9 out of 10 tests being done on asymptomatic patients that resulted in an artery-widening 'stent' being inserted were done on inappropriate grounds. \nSince stents require surgery, it's likely a number of these are inflating risk unnecessarily. \nAggressive management of prostate cancer \nProstate cancer is another condition that can be treated easily if found early. \nA blood test for markers called prostate antigens can do that, but it's hard to tell if they're produced by an aggressive tumour that needs to be dealt with or a slow growing one that the patient can take to their grave in years to come. \nJust 1 percent of men who had their prostate removed \u2013 risking the complications that go with that \u2013 died of the cancer. Of those who kept their prostate? About the same. \nSupplemental oxygen for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \nGiving more oxygen to patients with the lung illness COPD didn't help their lungs work better or improve their wellbeing. But it can cause them to retain carbon dioxide . Which isn't good. \nSurgery for meniscal cartilage tears \nRipping the C-shaped shock-absorbing discs of cartilage inside your knee is no laughing matter. But going to the trouble of repairing it surgically was found to have few benefits that couldn't be achieved through conservative management and rehabilitation. \nNutritional support in medical inpatients \nOverall, malnutrition doesn't do a patient much good. On the other hand, giving nutritional support to critically ill patients made no difference in terms of hospital stay or mortality, even if it helped them put on weight. \nIn the event of failing organs or metabolic complications , that support might carry risks that aren't balanced by benefits. \nUse of antibiotics \nA 2016 study estimated 506 prescriptions were being written in 2010 to 2011 for every 1000 people. Only 353 could be considered appropriate. \nThe CDC's National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria aims to reduce inappropriate outpatient antibiotic use by 50 percent within the next few years. \nThe researchers noted that of the measures in this plan, the most effective was to use social pressures, encouraging doctors to take note of good prescription practices among their colleagues. \nUse of cardiac imaging \nCardiac imaging for patients with chest pain was found to have tripled over the past decade, while doing nothing for low-risk patients. This risks leading to unnecessary hospital stays and interventions. \nThe solution? According to the researchers, doctors should share decision making with their patient. \nNone of these results should be taken to mean these tests and procedures are to be avoided. We're not medical professionals at ScienceAlert, so our best advice is \u2013 as always \u2013 don't be afraid to ask your doctor. \nResearch that takes a critical look at how professionals deliver medical care is important for maintaining high standards with available resources. \nThis research was published in JAMA Internal Medicine .

All rights reserved. Rohan Cleave, Melbourne Zoo Elusive 'Tree Lobster' Insect Was Just Officially Brought Back From The Dead Declared extinct 30 years ago. MICHELLE STARR 9 OCT 2017 A species is back from the grave, thanks to the hard work of an international conservation effort. The Australian Lord Howe Island stick insect, thought to have become extinct in the 1920s, is now officially alive again, confirmed by DNA testing. \nThe story spans decades, with a series of human failings, discoveries and eventual surprise successes that took DNA testing to finally get us to the good news there had only been slender hope for. \nWhen black rats were accidentally introduced to the island by a shipwreck in 1918, 600 kilometres (370 miles) off the east coast of Australia, they devastated the population of the phasmid, Dryococelus australis . \nThe rats were a disaster. They wiped out several native species - five birds, two plants and 13 invertebrates (including D. australis ) - not found anywhere else in the world. \nBut in the 1960s, rock climbers on Ball's Pyramid, a volcanic stack 20 kilometres (12 miles) southeast of the island, made an exciting discovery: a collection of fresh insect corpses that seemed to be the stick insect. \nBut they didn't look like specimens recovered from Lord Howe Island, as seen in the image below (the Ball's Pyramid insect is on the right), so the species was officially declared extinct in 1986. \nMikheyev et al., Current Biology \nBut then a small number of live insects was found in 2001, living on tea-trees on Ball's Pyramid, which spurred a captive breeding program. And now, finally, DNA testing has confirmed that the insects are, indeed, D. australis - an extremely rare success story. \n\"In this case, it seems like we're lucky and we have not lost this species forever, although by all rights we should have,\" said lead researcher Alexander Mikheyev , a professor at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University. \n\"We get another chance - but very often we do not.\" \nAlthough the Ball's Pyramid insects didn't look like the Lord Howe Island specimens, comparison between the genomes of the two found less than 1 percent difference - a small enough difference that they can officially be declared the same species. \nThis means that eventually, they may be reintroduced to Lord Howe Island, pending the completion of a rat eradication program that is due to commence in 2018 . \n\"Had our findings demonstrated that the Ball's Pyramid population was a distinct species, the release of these insects on Lord Howe Island would be regarded as an introduction,\" the researchers wrote in the paper . \nThis would mean a lot more red tape, since (and rightfully so) introducing a new species faces scrutiny and legislative barriers that reintroducing a species does not. But reintroduction would also mean that the insect would hopefully be able to breed and thrive in a much larger and more hospitable habitat. \nCurrently, they are still considered critically endangered . \nBall's Pyramid by Jon Clark, Flickr \nBut they no longer number among the 868 species classifed as extinct due to human causes on the IUCN Red List, which tracks 500 years of records. \n\"The stick insect illustrates the fragility of island ecosystems, and in particular, how vulnerable they are to manmade change like invasive species,\" Mikheyev said . \n\"It just took one shipwreck, and the fauna of the island has been altered in such a fundamental way.\" \nThe paper has been published in the journal Current Biology .

Here's Your Unique Chance to See a Newly Discovered Comet \nBinoculars at the ready! 9 OCT 2017 \nThere are countless chunks of icy debris swirling around the Oort cloud on the outskirts of the Solar System. But it's always exciting when one of those comes in our direction for a rare flyby. \nIn July, astronomers discovered a brand new comet zooming through the inner regions of our space bubble. Since that time it's been steadily getting brighter, and now is about the best time to finally catch a glimpse of it in the night sky. \nThe comet C/2017 O1 ASAS-SN was first detected on 19 July by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae , the same system that brought us new discoveries about the mysterious Tabby's star , massive space explosions , and stars shredded by black holes . \nNow, for the first time, the survey has discovered a comet which Northern Hemisphere stargazers can readily spot in the sky with the help of a backyard telescope or even just binoculars. \nComet O1 ASAS-SN is a long-period comet , and it probably takes at least several thousand years to cruise around the Sun and come back - so being able to spot it right now is a wonderful treat. \nWhen it was first found in July, the comet only clocked in a faint apparent magnitude of +15.3, which would make it barely visible even on a large telescope. (For comparison, the full Moon has an apparent magnitude of -13.) \nBut since then it's been massively growing in brightness, unexpectedly jumping to a magnitude of +10 within just a few days and with no explanation. \nAs it climbs higher in the sky, the comet is expected to top out at around a magnitude of +8, which is still too faint to see with the naked eye , but with decent-sized binoculars you have a solid chance. \nO1 ASAS-SN has traversed several constellations since first being sighted in Cetus. For the aficionados, it's passed by Eridanus, then right through Taurus between the Hyades and Pleiades (or Seven Sisters), and has now crossed into Perseus. \nTo find it in the night sky, make sure you go out on a night without the Moon and stay as far away from light pollution as possible, keeping in mind the comet's perihelion is on 14 October. Look towards Perseus while making sure to consult this sky map for a precise location. \nWhat you can expect to see is a fuzzy blob which remains blurry even as you focus on it. You may even be able to detect a faint green glow, caused by light emitted from cyanogen and diatomic carbon . \nAstronomer Damian Peach recently tweeted this photo, in which the green glow of the comet shows up remarkably well: #Comet C/2017 O1 (ASASSN) alongside the Northern Trifid nebula (NGC 1579) on Oct 2nd. https://t.co/eaVq6pRTNF pic.twitter.com/cr3tq4Hq6H \u2014 Damian Peach (@peachastro) October 7, 2017 \nAnd if you can't drag yourself out of bed, or are not lucky enough to be in the correct hemisphere for this celestial wonder (like us here at ScienceAlert), here's another, closer look: Comet C/2017/O1 (ASASSN) from this morning.Courtesy Fritz Helmut Hemmerich. pic.twitter.com/2aDxKoF4V9 \u2014 Con Stoitsis (@vivstoitsis) September 28, 2017 \nAh, almost as good as the real deal.

PETER DOCKRILL 9 OCT 2017 \nThe nearest star system to our own could hold our best chance of finding a habitable, Earth-like exoplanet \u2013 but it may also be concealing a dark, long-kept secret. \nAlpha Centauri, located just 4.37 light-years from our own Solar System, is the closest thing we have to a neighbour in the galaxy, but it looks like one of its three stars could be a victim of theft on an interstellar scale. \nAccording to new research, Proxima Centauri \u2013 the host of the much-hyped Proxima b , which scientists think could be our closest habitable exoplanet \u2013 didn't originate beside its stellar companions, Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B. \nWhile the potential habitability of Proxima b is a hotly debated topic in astronomy and astrophysics, what could be even more remarkable is that this alien world didn't always hang so close to our own Solar System. \nNew calculations run by researchers at the University of Hertfordshire in the UK suggest that the Alpha Centauri system may have once only contained two stars \u2013 Alpha Centauri A and B \u2013 which gravitationally intercepted a third in Proxima Centauri. \nRunning simulations of the three stars' orbits over an epic 10-billion year time frame, the team found the orbit of Proxima Centauri was only bound to Alpha Centauri A and B in 74 percent of cases. \n\"If the three stars have been orbiting each other for a few billion years, one would think they'd be a nice happy family,\" astrophysicist Scott Kenyon from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, who wasn't involved with the study, told New Scientist . \nIn other circumstances \u2013 simulations of the star's orbit called 'clones' \u2013 the star became unbound from its companions: an instability the researchers think is most unusual if the stars had all been born in the same system. \nIn some of the modelling, this instability even became more apparent. \n\"If the system migrated outward in the Milky Way to its current location, more than 50 percent of clones could become unstable in backward simulations,\" the authors write in their paper . \n\"The ratio of unstable clones increases with the simulation time scale and encounter rate.\" \nAll told, the team thinks there's a 25 percent chance that Proxima Centauri \u2013 and its host planet, Proxima b \u2013 were captured in the gravitational embrace of Alpha Centauri A and B at some point in galactic history, unknown aeons ago. \nOf course, it's only a one-in-four hypothetical possibility based on simulations at this point, but if this capture scenario is what actually happened in Proxima Centauri's distant past, it could potentially boost the prospects of finding life on Proxima b, the team thinks. \nThat's because, in its current stellar environment, there's evidence to suggest Proxima b might be incapable of hosting life , but the researchers think if Proxima Centauri's union with Alpha Centauri A and B is a more recent phenomenon, then the chances for life on it are stronger. \n\"Life needs time to develop and emerge,\" one of the researchers, Fabo Feng, told New Scientist . \n\"This scenario gives it more time.\" More From ScienceAlert \n  1 hour ago", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter dockrill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott kenyon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alpha centauri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard-smithsonian centre for astrophysics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new scientist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "proxima centauri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fabo feng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "proxima", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of hertfordshire", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T07:16:13.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4afa11a569b9dc06416a9604302efb9fe71d2e56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGKqRaBfLNluzi5pfcmNBZztFqkKUgRfEzqRyM75eNK8fOGJkmJTHOg_EZcDRqIIVFZDxQp0z4C73ZgsowcN2q.0CFRBuF5tv9", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert -

All rights reserved. YIUCHEUNG/Shutterstock.com BREAKING: Physicists Just Smashed a Quantum Light Measurement Limit \nAn achievement decades in the making. PETER DOCKRILL 9 OCT 2017 \nScientists have set a new record in optical measurements using photons, achieving a level of precision that before now was only possible in the world of theory. \nIn a first-of-its-kind experiment, a team of physicists has broken through what's called the shot-noise limit \u2013 maximising the amount of information that can be extracted from individual particles of light in optical measurements. \nFor decades, theoretical physicists have predicted that taking measurements with photons in quantum states \u2013 where individual particles of light are entangled \u2013 could deliver an advantage over measurements taken with light in non-quantum states. \n\"When photons are entangled, their properties are correlated, or connected together,\" quantum physicist Geoff Pryde from Griffith University in Australia told ScienceAlert. \n\"This means there is less randomness in the measurement. However, it turns out that these entangled states only work if the entangled photons are high-quality and don't go 'missing'.\" \nThat's because randomness creeps into optical measurements when individual particles of light are unintentionally absorbed or scattered in the measurement device, or are simply not detected. \nThis limitation, the shot-noise limit, has previously prevented scientists from achieving the theoretical limits of super-sensitive measurements with photons in quantum states , but thanks to new research by Pryde and his team, that's no longer the case. \n\"What is new here is that we are able to make and measure high-quality photons with high efficiency (they don't go missing),\" Pryde explains, \"and so we can show that the technique really works as described in the theory.\" \nTo achieve this, the team passed a laser through a nonlinear crystal, with the properties of each being carefully tailored to give high-quality entangled photons. \nThen the photons are passed through a sample \u2013 whichever object is being measured, which in the study was quartz crystal. \nBy doing so, and measuring the photons with their high-efficiency detectors, the team was able to show that the shot-noise limit can be unconditionally broken through, meaning random noise can be avoided in extremely precise optical measurements. \n\"It shows that photons in certain quantum states really can be used to make certain kinds of measurement better than when we don't use quantum physics,\" explains Pryde. \n\"We hope that future extensions (entangling many more than two photons together) can be used for precision measurement of sensitive samples.\" \nAs for what those samples could be, the team acknowledges it's a little early to speculate. But it's possible that in the future, this kind of method could enable scientists to measure material with very little light at all. \nThat could be used to measure biological samples with a limited number of photons, so as not to damage delicate specimens. \nBut for now, the biggest accomplishment is showing that photons can actually be used to measure in this way without being lost \u2013 delivering upon the theoretical promise of decades ago. \nThe findings are reported in Nature Photonics .

When not observed, they behave as particles and waves; when observed, they can only behave as particles. \nThe area has been well studied by researchers, including one 2011 paper that also demonstrated that the momentum of a photon moving through openings is disturbed when measurements are taken of its position. \nThis new research, led by \u00c1ngel Rubio of the University of the Basque Country and the Max Planck Institute PMSD, concerns the observation of heat and particles in a current. \nWe all know how current works. It usually flows in one direction - from an upper elevation to a lower one, or from a hotter temperature to a cooler one. But in quantum devices, the team found, the act of observing makes flow in one direction or the other more likely. \n\"We demonstrate that in a standard thermo-electric nanodevice the current and heat flows are not only dictated by the temperature and potential gradient, but also by the external action of a local quantum observer that controls the coherence of the device,\" the researchers wrote in their paper . \n\"Depending on how and where the observation takes place, the direction of heat and particle currents can be independently controlled. In fact, we show that the current and heat flow in a quantum material can go against the natural temperature and voltage gradients.\" \nThey found that when a quantum observer measures the system at certain points, it has an effect on the direction of the current. When there is no observer, the heat flows from warmer to cooler, as you would expect. When observed in a certain location, the current's natural flow is amplified. When observed in the opposite location the current changes direction, moving from cold to hot. \nBelow, you can see an artist's impression of the role of a quantum observer as it would apply to water flow: depending on where the observer is positioned, and what part of the figure is seen, the water will be seen to flow differently. \n\u00a9 K. Aranburu \nThis seems to be a violation of Rudolf Clausius' 1854 statement of the second law of thermodynamics: \"It is impossible for a self acting machine working in a cyclic process without any external force, to transfer heat from a body at a lower temperature to a body at a higher temperature.\" \nBut, according to Rubio, the model does no such thing. \n\"What happens is that the fact of looking, of inserting an observer into the system, acts as an obstacle, as if you were to close off the channel in a pipeline through which the water is flowing,\" he explained . \n\"Obviously, if the load starts to build up, it would end up going in the opposite direction. In other words, the observer projects the state of the system onto a state that transmits the current or energy in opposite directions.\" \nThis discovery could be used for quantum transportation with directional control, with potential applications in nanoscale systems covering fields such as thermoelectrics, spintronic injection, phononics, and sensing. \nBut that's a long way off - creating the system in the real world will take quite a bit of work. \n\"We have worked from a theoretical perspective in which we have proposed a simple model and the theory can be easily verified because all the energy and entropy flows are preserved,\" Rubio said . \n\"Carrying out this process experimentally would be another matter. Although the type of device that would need to be designed exists, and producing it would be feasible, right now there is no possibility of doing this in a controlled way.\" \nThose quantum particles will just have to keep going the long way around in the meantime. \nThe research has been published in the journal npj Quantum Materials .

So, which one is it and how do we know? \nThe Universe may seem pretty vast , and stars pretty innumerable, but that alone does not preclude the possibility that what we're actually looking at, our entire existence, is just a computer simulation. \nTheoretical physicists working in the quantum mechanics realm say that's all stuff and nonsense , but consider this. \n\"If our current understanding of physics is correct, then it's impossible to simulate the whole universe with its trillions and trillions of things - but we don't actually need to, anyway,\" explains the video. \n\"We only need enough of the universe to fool the inhabitants of our simulation into thinking that they're real.\" \nAccording to the team at Kurzgesagt and their collaborator Jake Roper from Vsauce3 , we could only have enough matter simulated around us for what we're actually interacting with. \nFor example, the chair you're sitting on might only have enough simulated atoms to form the outer shell, and is empty inside until you decide to break off a leg, only to see more simulated material inside at that point - but it was not there before. \nMaybe your body is empty too, until you draw some blood, or open it up to find squishy simulated contents. In which case, all you need for feeling like you truly exist is just a consciousness. \nBut that's also where this mind-boggling philosophical approach to reality starts fraying at the edges, since there are a bunch of assumptions we have to make if we're to speculate that this world is just a fancy version of some galactic species' idea of the Sims 4. \nThe first of those assumptions: it's possible to simulate consciousness. That's a pretty massive hurdle to overcome, since we don't even know what consciousness is and what it's made of . \nEven if it's enough to just have a disembodied brain to make consciousness happen, the brain is still the most complex structure we know of, with an insane amount of connections to be modelled. \nMultiply that by the number of people that exist, and you have on your hands (or alien tentacles) the need for insanely huge computational power that may or may not be technologically possible. \nWhich brings us to the second assumption - that technological progress will actually advance to the point where such computers are possible, even if they have to be the size of an entire planet . \nAnd even if we have tackled these first two assumptions, there are more considerations. Can a civilisation advance to such a technological point without killing itself, and if yes, would it even want to run such a simulation with Earth and its little people? \nWe'll leave it to the Kurzgesagt video below to explain the rest of the argument, but here's the worst part: whatever the case, there is no way for us to know whether we are real or simulated. \nSo while it's fun to think about these problems and bend our minds just a little, we might as well just live our best lives anyway. Simulated or not, ours is the only reality we have.

All rights reserved. S. Epps & M. Hudson / University of Waterloo Astronomers Have Finally Found Most of The Universe's Missing Visible Matter \nWhoa. 10 OCT 2017 \nIn our eagerness to identity the Universe's occult phenomena of dark energy and dark matter, we often forget that most of its better defined particles also seem to be MIA. \nRelax. We now have our first solid piece of evidence that this matter has been hiding in the delicate threads of cosmic webbing bridging neighbouring galaxies, right where the models predicted. \nTwo separate teams of astronomers used similar approaches to establish the presence of what is described as baryonic matter in the space between galaxies. \nWhen the term is used in astronomy, Baryonic matter consists largely of the kinds of building-block particles listed in your high school physics text book, such as protons, neutrons, and electrons. \nIt's thought to only make up about 4.6 percent of everything, with dark matter and dark energy comprising the rest. \nAstrophysicists can get a sense of how much of this matter is up among the stars and glowing gas clouds by studying the light they emit, and then multiplying this mass based on what we know about the size and density of the Universe. \nBut while you might imagine this adds up to a lot of particles, the calculated total falls well short of the amount that should have coalesced from the Universe's pool of radiation post Big Bang. \nHow short? About 90 percent of that ancient baryonic bonanza seems to be missing from the shinier parts of our cosmos. \nA fraction of this missing matter could exist as diffuse halos of dust and gas surrounding galaxies like ours, but this still leaves a lot of baryons unaccounted for. \nOne big part of the problem is if the matter isn't spilling some kind of light or casting a shadow, we just can't spot it. \nDiscoveries in recent years that have established vast webs of dark matter stretching across space have made it increasingly likely that the normally visible matter has accumulated in filaments bridging galaxies. \nSuspecting it is out there is one thing. Hard evidence is what astronomers needed. \nIt wouldn't be dense enough to block starlight or hot enough to provide a signature, making it hard to spot with most measurement techniques. \nSo both teams of researchers relied on something called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect , a phenomenon that causes photons left over from the glow of the Big Bang to scatter into slightly higher energies as they pass through the electrons in the gases surrounding galaxy clusters. \nEach team used data on pairs of galaxies taken from catalogues in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey . After sorting the pairs based on their relative orientation, the researchers stacked them to reinforce any faint patterns they might share. \nOne team, led by researchers from the University of British Columbia, found the density of these filaments to be just under three times the average density of baryons in the surrounding void. \nThe other team, from the University of Edinburgh, concluded the figure was about six times the average density. \n\"We expect some differences because we are looking at filaments at different distances,\" researcher Hideki Tanimura from the University of British Columbia told Leah Crane from New Scientist . \n\"If this factor is included, our findings are very consistent with the other group.\" \nExpanded out over the cosmic web, the results go a long way in accounting for that missing matter. \nBoth studies are currently on the pre-publishing website arXiv.org, so you can dive into the details now ahead of their final peer reviewed publications. \nBigger surveys in the future will no doubt provide more data that can help define a more precise figure for the amount of visible matter collecting along the Universe's dark threads. \nThe fact two studies independently came to similar results is pretty strong evidence, though, reinforcing existing models on the Universe and the evolution of galaxies. \nThis research is on arXiv.org here and here .

All rights reserved. Thomas Abraham-James/Helium One Massive 'Life-Saving' Helium Field Just Turned Out to Be Far Bigger Than We'd Hoped No more helium shortage! 10 OCT 2017 \nNew analysis of a gargantuan helium deposit discovered in Tanzania last year has revealed that there may be much more of the gas than initial surveys revealed. \nAt the time, the find, called \" life-saving ,\" was estimated to contain at least 54 billion cubic feet (1.5 billion cubic metres). To put that in perspective, domestic helium consumption in the US for 2016 was 1.7 billion cubic feet, and the US has total known helium reserves of 153 billion cubic feet. \nNow, according to new measurements taken of the helium, there could be a lot more than that - around 98.6 billion cubic feet, according to Thomas Abraham-James, CEO of helium company Helium One. \n\"It's pretty much doubled in size,\" he told Live Science . \nThe global helium shortage affects a lot more than blimps and party balloons. \nHelium is used to cool the magnetic resonance magnets in MRI machines , and it's also used as a coolant for nuclear magnetic resonance and at the Large Hadron Collider. NASA uses it in rocket fuel , and it's also used as a carrier gas in gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy . \nThe new estimates were based on new, real-time measurements taken by University of Oxford geologists Peter Barry and Chris Ballentine in late 2016. The field-sampling methods used in 2015 for the initial estimate allowed air into the sample, so the density of helium showed as much lower than it should have. \n\"Detailed macroseep gas compositions ... shows the deep gas to contain between 8-10 percent helium, significantly increasing resource estimates based on uncorrected values,\" Barry and Ballentine wrote in the abstract of a paper they presented in August at the 2017 Goldschmidt Conference . \nThe initial samples contained an average of 2.6 percent helium. For those, the samples were collected in the field and taken back to laboratory for analysis. By comparison, for last year's survey, Barry and Ballentine used a portable mass spectrometer. \n\"We made probably 50 measurements out there in the field, and we saw up to four times as much helium in these samples,\" Barry said . \"So this was really exciting for us, because we were able to show quite convincingly that there's a lot more helium than we originally assessed.\" \nThe deposit found last year could turn things around - not just because of its size, but how it was found. \nThe research team found that volcanic activity releases helium trapped deep underground into shallower pockets closer to the Earth's surface. Armed with this information, they went looking for a helium deposit - and found it . \nAt the time the discovery was announced, Ballentine said that 54 billion cubic feet was enough to fill 1.2 million MRI machines. The new estimate of 98.6 billion cubic feet could fill 2.2 million. \nAnd, according to Abraham-James, that estimate is conservative. \n\"We are probably still somewhat understating what is present, but nevertheless, that gives us room to update and improve as we progress,\" he said .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "barry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas abraham-james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abraham-james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter barry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris ballentine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hadron collider", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ballentine", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldschmidt conference", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tanzania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T07:14:33.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8bf1ae5150f3b91fc0af298a38ff3d6467e16ab3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGh8a2f1mz6mT.RAAduLJ0E8bej02FmZTGaR99Hv_ZGtMxXwS7krV3rMx.SnDNTrwSRlx0FgLO8eZ2Pyf.SIgZFZVdURt_IduxIj2m5tOporw-", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "Astronomers Have Finally Found Most of The Universe's Missing Visible Matter", "title_full": "Astronomers Have Finally Found Most of The Universe's Missing Visible Matter", "published": "2017-10-10T08:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/darkmatterbridge_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5336, "comments": 0, "shares": 5336}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 32}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8bf1ae5150f3b91fc0af298a38ff3d6467e16ab3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGh8a2f1mz6mT.RAAduLJ0E8bej02FmZTGaR99Hv_ZGtMxXwS7krV3rMx.SnDNTrwSRlx0FgLO8eZ2Pyf.SIgZFZVdURt_IduxIj2m5tOporw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike McRae", "published": "2017-10-10T08:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Astronomers Have Finally Found Most of The Universe's Missing Visible Matter", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd.

VanderWolf Images/Shutterstock.com EPA Says \"The War on Coal Is Over\" in Major Reversal of Obama's Clean Power Plan \n  PETER DOCKRILL 10 OCT 2017 \nThe Trump administration has formally announced its plan to repeal the Clean Power Plan \u2013 President Obama's key policy to cut greenhouse gas emissions produced by power plants. \nThe decision, announced by EPA chief Scott Pruitt on Monday, was widely expected but still comes as a blow to advocates for the environment, and follows a pledge to abandon another measure to protect the atmosphere from dangerous pollutants, the Paris climate agreement . \n\"The war on coal is over,\" Pruitt said at an event in the town of Hazard, located in the coal heartland of Kentucky. \n\"The EPA and no federal agency should ever use its authority to say to you: we are going to declare war on any sector of our economy.\" \nThe goal of the Clean Power Plan (CPP), announced by Obama in 2015, was to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electrical power generation by 32 percent by 2030 (relative to 2005 levels), to be achieved by lessening the impact of coal-fired power plants and increasing the use of renewable energy. \nBut while the decision to scrap the initiative will be seen as a backward step in US efforts to curb carbon emissions, in truth the CPP was already effectively held back by congressional and legal challenges , resulting in the US Supreme Court halting the enforcement of the plan last year. \nNonetheless, the reaction from defenders of the stalled scheme has been unequivocal. \n\"With this news, Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt will go down in infamy for launching one of the most egregious attacks ever on public health, our climate, and the safety of every community in the United States,\" the executive director of environment non-profit Sierra Club, Michael Brune, said in a statement . \n\"He's proposing to throw out a plan that would prevent thousands of premature deaths and tens of thousands of childhood asthma attacks every year.\" \nIn an order to be signed Tuesday, Pruitt will declare that the Clean Power Plan overstepped the EPA's legal authority in attempting to force power companies to reduce carbon emissions, which penalised utilities, especially coal-fired plants that could not reasonably meet the goals. \n\"When you think about what that rule meant, it was about picking winners and losers,\" Pruitt said . \n\"The past administration was using every bit of power and authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers and how we generate electricity in this country. That's wrong.\" \nBut while the new EPA proposal will seek to tear the CPP down, according to a leaked draft seen by some in the media , the revised plan doesn't offer a replacement strategy on how to regulate emissions. \nInstead, the EPA is expected to seek public input on how to curb emissions from coal-fired plants as well as natural gas companies. \nThe repeal itself is expected to take months, and is likely to encounter several challenges from environmental groups and Democrats \u2013 but some say, regardless of the gutting of the CPP, the decline of coal is ultimately inevitable in the face of increasingly cheaper renewable energy . \nNot to mention that the majority of the international community \u2013 and several US states \u2013 are vowing to push ahead with efforts to reduce emissions with or without the federal government's help. \n\"Even if they repeal the Clean Power Plan, or replace it with something that doesn't require us to do very much, you still have to reckon with the fact that ultimately regulations on carbon are coming,\" the chairman of the Arkansas Public Service commission, Ted J. Thomas, told The New York Times . \n\"So we need to develop options to deal with that other than sticking our heads in the sand and hoping we can just file lawsuits forever.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T07:14:34.541+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1aff0633be3a54bc98a6231492a3a4853bd51304", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG3gPgIK1znzE4SnQZqJIRrdvescJamCLFMe2hWa66m7ncnffD85NkIJm4cLb0GLDO1BWaBe1GN2EDwa9zja1c9_6XKAYdkxi0AMvKJiGURhUK3d.FQpnibw--", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&topic=snc&output=rss", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "Science - Google News", "title": "This Ancient Martian Lake Offers More Clues For How Life First Started on Earth - ScienceAlert", "title_full": "This Ancient Martian Lake Offers More Clues For How Life First Started on Earth - ScienceAlert", "published": "2017-10-10T08:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/mars-lake-1_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1199, "comments": 0, "shares": 1199}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1aff0633be3a54bc98a6231492a3a4853bd51304", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG3gPgIK1znzE4SnQZqJIRrdvescJamCLFMe2hWa66m7ncnffD85NkIJm4cLb0GLDO1BWaBe1GN2EDwa9zja1c9_6XKAYdkxi0AMvKJiGURhUK3d.FQpnibw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T08:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Ancient Martian Lake Offers More Clues For How Life First Started on Earth - ScienceAlert", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. Estimated depths of the ancient Eridania sea. Credit: NASA This Ancient Martian Lake Offers More Clues For How Life First Started on Earth \nA 3.7-billion-year-old mystery. 10 OCT 2017 \nMars may be an arid wasteland today, but that wasn't always the case \u2013 and scientists have discovered evidence that a huge sea existed on southern Mars some 3.7 billion years ago, filled with hot springs pumping out water packed with minerals. \nWhat's more, experts think this hydrothermal undersea activity matches what was happening on Earth at the same time, potentially giving us clues about how life began on our own planet. \nAccording to the international team of researchers behind the study, this combination of rocks, water, nutrients, and heat could have sparked life into being on Mars as well, but has just as much to teach us about the origins of life on Earth. \n\"Even if we never find evidence that there's been life on Mars, this site can tell us about the type of environment where life may have begun on Earth,\" says one of the team , Paul Niles from the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. \n\"Volcanic activity combined with standing water provided conditions that were likely similar to conditions that existed on Earth at about the same time \u2013 when early life was evolving here.\" \nHow the sea of Eridania may have looked and worked.

These new results give us an exciting window into the past. \n\"This site gives us a compelling story for a deep, long-lived sea and a deep-sea hydrothermal environment,\" says Niles . \nIts potential to birth life doesn't just apply to the Red Planet though: \"It is evocative of the deep-sea hydrothermal environments on Earth, similar to environments where life might be found on other worlds \u2013 life that doesn't need a nice atmosphere or temperate surface, but just rocks, heat and water,\" adds Niles. \nWe're not sure whether or not this hydrothermal activity could be one of the origins of life on either Mars or the Earth yet \u2013 though life has subsequently flourished on our own planet and has yet to be seen on Mars. \nWhat makes the finding so valuable to scientists is that evidence of this sort of underwater activity here on Earth has been poorly preserved and is difficult to study, so the Martian landscape could fill in a few of the blanks. \nRight now the idea that life on Earth began in the chemical reactions sparked off by underwater springs is one of the best hypotheses we've got. Another idea is that the most basic forms of life began to grow from meteorite fragments in small, warm ponds on the surface of the planet. \nWith help from the Martian data we might be able to learn more about the truth of the origins of life on Earth \u2013 as well as on Mars and the other planets and moons in our Solar System, such as Saturn's icy moon Enceladus . \nThe Reconnaissance Orbiter will continue to keep a close eye on Eridania, and it could be a prime candidate for further exploration in the Mars missions of the future as we look for more evidence for life on Mars. \n\"Ancient, deep-water hydrothermal deposits in Eridania basin represent a new category of astrobiological target on Mars,\" conclude the researchers . \nThe research has been published in Nature Communications .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "niles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul niles", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reconnaissance orbiter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saturn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature communications", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa johnson space center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eridania", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eridania sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red planet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eridania basin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great lakes of north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eridania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T09:05:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2bfd2fcb2734765d244fc239600f867118dff3e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuNi9n3RHyGq0put5ifoDq6WzEIvfMGp923il0HlBStBt7q8CGAbhFIOZKZydRWuqATUIku9qrO7f1_rp5N5Zz752nsvQIawk0zOw7bsqrFS_pnIw2ScAL7FTODbokzHw-", "site_full": "sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Carbon released by warming soils could trigger a disastrous feedback loop - ScienceAlert", "title_full": "Carbon released by warming soils could trigger a disastrous feedback loop - ScienceAlert", "published": "2017-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/hot-soil-1_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 9}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2bfd2fcb2734765d244fc239600f867118dff3e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuNi9n3RHyGq0put5ifoDq6WzEIvfMGp923il0HlBStBt7q8CGAbhFIOZKZydRWuqATUIku9qrO7f1_rp5N5Zz752nsvQIawk0zOw7bsqrFS_pnIw2ScAL7FTODbokzHw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Nield", "published": "2017-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Carbon released by warming soils could trigger a disastrous feedback loop - ScienceAlert", "text": "Carbon Released by Warming Soils Could Trigger a Disastrous Feedback Loop \n\"Once it starts it may be very difficult to turn off.\" DAVID NIELD 7 OCT 2017 \nAs soil warms up, it leaks carbon, and a new study suggests higher temperatures could release more carbon than we thought, potentially creating a dangerous feedback loop that would cause the planet to get hotter and hotter. \nThat's based on experiments stretching back 26 years in a hardwood forest in Massachusetts, where researchers have been artificially heating certain sections of soil to see the effects. \nThe team from the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Massachusetts, the University of Massachusetts, and the University of New Hampshire, says rising temperatures cause a two-stage cycle where carbon output increases for several years then levels off \u2013 probably due to soil microbes adjusting to the warmer conditions. \nAfter that readjustment, carbon release levels start rising again. The worry is that warmer soil would cause a warmer atmosphere, in turn heating up the ground and perpetuating temperature rise we have no control over. \nResearchers in the Harvard Forest. Credit: University of Massachusetts \n\"This self-reinforcing feedback is potentially a global phenomenon with soils, and once it starts it may be very difficult to turn off,\" one of the team, Jerry Melillo from the MBL, told Meghan Bartels at Newsweek . \n\"It's that part of the problem that I think is sobering.\" \nScientists admit they've still got plenty more to learn about soil microbes and how they release carbon, and so long-term detailed studies like this are vital in understanding the processes going on. \nWay back in 1991, heating coils similar to those used to keep sports pitches from freezing were buried about 10 centimetres (3.9 inches) underground in the Harvard Forest , keeping certain parts of the forest soil surface 5\u00b0C (9\u00b0F) warmer than control plots. \nSince then, the heated patches have lost 17 percent of the carbon stored in the top 60 centimetres (23.6 inches) of soil, where most organic matter is held. Carbon loss in warmer soil outpaced the rate in the control plots in two bursts, 1991-2000 and 2008-2013. \nIn between those periods, carbon release was at similar levels in both the heated and unheated areas: the scientists think this cycle is caused as the number of microbes increase, feasting on hard-to-digest organic matter like the lignin in plants, and pushing out more carbon as a result. \nAerial view of the heated patches. Credit: Audrey Barker-Plotkin \nWhen the food runs out, the microbes adapt and reorganise, leading to lulls in the carbon release, suggest the researchers. Since 2014, carbon emissions from the heated plots have again dropped, and the monitoring continues today. \n\"If a significant amount of that soil carbon is added to the atmosphere, due to microbial activity in warmer soils, that will accelerate the global warming process,\" says Melillo . \"And once this self-reinforcing feedback begins, there is no easy way to turn it off. There is no switch to flip.\" \nAs the team points out, every year we pump about 10 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, mostly through burning fossil fuels. About 3,500 billion tonnes are thought to be stored in the world's soil. \nA significant part of that is stored in big pools of frozen soil in the Arctic \u2013 the carbon there is easily decomposed, and we know temperatures at the poles are on the rise . \nNot only does having carbon locked away in soil mean it's kept out of the atmosphere, it also helps soil stay healthy by holding water and helping plants to grow. \n\"If these findings hold more widely across major terrestrial ecosystems, then a much greater portion of the global soil carbon store could be vulnerable to decomposition and release of carbon dioxide under global warming than previously thought,\" Daniel Metcalfe, from Lund University in Sweden, told Fiona Harvey at The Guardian . \nJust last week a separate study warned that forests are released more carbon than they're storing, thanks to widespread deforestation. We can now add warming soil to the ways that these wooded areas could push carbon levels higher. \nThe only encouragement we can take from this lengthy study is that we're learning more all the time about how carbon cycles and various natural tipping points could influence overall temperature rise on the planet. \nWith a better understanding of how the microbial processes work, there is some evidence that we can manage the soil under our feet to trap carbon dioxide and slow the pace of global warming \u2013 but much more research is needed, and we're running out of time . \n\"The future is a warmer future,\" says Melillo . \"How much warmer is the issue.\" \nThe research has been published in Science .

MIKE MCRAE 10 OCT 2017 \nMen and women get slightly different boosts of that neurological happy-drug dopamine when they perform altruistic acts, according to a new study. \nBefore we jump feet-first into any \"men are from Mars, women are from Venus\" garbage, there's a lot to unpack in experiments like this. Still, the results also hint at some interesting biochemistry behind the behaviours of gender that might help support \u2013 or even break down \u2013 our ideas of what it means to be male and female. \nIn a novel double blind experiment designed to identify whether differences in our brain's chemistry could help explain generosity, researchers from the University of Zurich restricted dopamine receptors in a group of volunteers and watched as they were given a sum of money. \nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that performs a bunch of different tasks in the brain, one of which helps communicate pleasure and reward. That 'feel good' rush you get when you receive praise or achieve a goal is in part mediated by this chemical. \nThe researchers based their research on a sample of 55 participants \u2013 27 identifying as female, 28 as male. \nThe volunteers were randomly sorted into two groups before being dosed with either a dopamine blocker called amisulpride or a placebo. \nThey were then given two tasks. In the first, each was given a choice between getting a handful of Swiss francs to keep, or a smaller reward that was shared with a friend in the group or somebody who was more of a stranger. \nThe second task served as a control, where the participant was offered a choice between a small reward now and a bigger reward if they waited 90 days. \nOnce evaluated, the two groups were swapped to receive the other pill and be tested again. \nThe results weren't mindblowing, but they were determined to be significant. \nWhen taking the placebo, women in the study chose to share 51 percent of the time. Men, on the other hand, did this on just 40 percent of occasions. \nWith the dopamine blocker, women offered to split their prize just 45 percent of the time. Men actually became slightly more prosocial without the dopamine at 44 percent. \nThe study indicates that, down a gender division of male or female participants, there could be differences in the neurotransmitter rush that nudges them to be a little more caring and sharing. \nBeyond that statistical variation, it's currently all speculation. It's not clear if this difference could emerge from variations in our chromosomes, or if it's a learned behaviour shaped by decades of social conditioning. \nCritically, a group of 55 is also a fairly small sample size, and the differences \u2013 while interesting \u2013 weren't exactly overwhelming. \nAdding to this, as cognitive neuroscientist Gina Rippon from Aston University told Nicola Davis at The Guardian , the data was pooled from two different groups of participants performing slightly different tasks, introducing room for error. \nAll of that aside, the conclusions raise some fascinating questions on the limits of decision making and the influence of gender. There's just more work to be done to explore what this result could really mean. \nThroughout history, scientists have debated the characteristics that separate men and women and wondered how much is nature \u2013 and deeply embedded \u2013 and how much is nurture, subject to change. \nExperiments like this one offer tools for studying the neurochemistry behind pro and antisocial behaviours, potentially helping us better understand the subtle interactions of genetics, cultural expectations, and anatomy. \nWho knows, it might turn out men and women are both from Earth after all. \nThis research was published in Nature Human Behaviour .

MICHELLE STARR The electric honeycomb, or rose window instability, is a curious phenomenon. \nIt occurs when a high-voltage corona charge - the ionisation of air surrounding a conductor - is applied from a vertical needle over oil on a steel plate. The surface wrinkles up into a structure resembling a honeycomb, or a rose window - hence the name. \nThis pattern is an instability caused by the build-up of ions applying pressure to the surface of the low-conductivity oil between the two metal conducting materials as the ions attempt to ground, pushing the oil thinner and thinner so they can get through. But the oil wants to maintain its surface structure, so the pattern forms. \nAnd now, for the first time, someone has photographed the movement of those ions. And that someone is a 17-year-old from Pakistan. \nMuhammad Shaheer Niazi (Lahore University of Management Sciences) \nHigh school student Muhammad Shaheer Niazi of Lahore College of Arts and Sciences was assigned the problem of the electric honeycomb at the 2016 International Young Physicists' Tournament in Russia. \nUpon returning home, he decided to try and get published - but in order to do so, he needed to contribute to the existing research and knowledge. \n\"We have to add something new to get published, and I introduced two new factors in the electric honeycomb phenomenon,\" he said on Pakistani news program NewsWise . \nRSOS \nTo photograph the movement of the ions, he used a technique called Schlieren photography , an optical method used to see fluid densities. We can't, for example, usually see changes in temperature or gases in the air, but since they refract light they can cast shadows. \nWhen the ions in the electric honeycomb experiment move from the conducting needle, they create a small wind, and it's this that shows up in Niazi's photographs, as seen in the image above. \nHe also used thermal imaging to photograph the temperature changes over the oil as the honeycombs form, increasing and spreading out from directly under the needle. These temperature changes, the paper notes, are due to residual gas heating and exothermic reactions. \nHowever, they're also somewhat puzzling. No one has measured the temperature before, and according to physicist Alberto T. P\u00e9rez Izquierdo , who wrote a paper on electric honeycombs in 1997 , the heating effect is larger and less even than expected. More research is required to figure out why. \nNiazi's paper has been published in the peer-review journal Royal Society Open Science - perhaps foreshadowing greatness ahead. \n\"Newton was 17 when his first research got published in the same journal,\" Niazi said .

MICHELLE STARR 11 OCT 2017 \nIt's probably no great surprise, but very little is known about exactly how sexual interactions take place between marine mammals and how genitalia has evolved to suit their needs. \nSo a team of researchers decided to figure it out using the preserved genitalia from dead ones. External genitalia are weird. The male penis is one of the most morphologically diverse and rapidly evolving organs, and even between closely related species, they can vary wildly in size and shape. \nRelatively little attention has been paid to female genitalia, in comparison. Because of this, it was previously thought that female genitalia evolved much more slowly - but recent research suggest that male and female genitalia can evolve together . \nThe best hypothesis we have for this rapid evolution is sexual selection, because the shape of the genitalia can determine how effectively the penis deposits sperm. \nAnd a 2013 study on fruit flies found that coevolution occurs in structures in the male and female genitalia that come into contact with each other. \nLed by researcher Dara Orbach of Dalhousie University in Canada, the team collected the genitalia of sexually mature male and female harbour porpoises, bottlenose dolphins, short-beaked common dolphins, and harbour seals that had died of natural causes, and selected the best male and female specimens from each species for further study. \nD. Orbach et al/Proceedings of the Royal Society B \nThe penises, shown in the image above next to silicone endocasts of the vaginas, were pumped full of saline to make them erect. \nBoth sets of genitals were fixed in a formaldehyde solution so they would keep their shape, and the penises inserted into the vaginas and sewn into place. \nThen the team used computed tomography to gauge how the penis fits inside the vagina, how deeply it penetrates, and which structures inside come into contact. \n\"While it may seem intuitive that the penis fits well into the vagina during copulation, the biomechanics and details of the anatomical fit can be quite complex and have seldom been explored,\" Orbach said in a statement earlier this year . \n\"Whales, dolphins and porpoises have unusual vaginal folds, spirals and recesses that the penis and sperm must navigate through to successfully fertilise the egg.\" \nThe team also used 3D modelling software to create 3D models of the genitalia constructed from photographs - up to 153 photos per specimen. These models were then used to figure out how the penises best fit inside the vaginas for fertilisation. \nThe result of all this mummified marine mammal hanky panky? Yeah. It's probably not just the male evolving. \n\"In the species examined, the genitalia of male and female marine mammals appear to have closely coevolved,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. \n\"The tip of the penis or shape of the terminal portion of the shaft and the lumen of the vagina strongly suggest morphological covariation. We suggest both congruent and antagonistic coevolution of male and female genitalia can occur among marine mammals.\" \nThis suggests that, by angling her body a certain way, the female can attempt to divert the sperm into one of the complicated recesses inside the structure of her vagina, and away from the egg, should she not wish to reproduce. \nBut the research has implications far beyond porpoises. The technique, the researchers suggest, can be used to study copulation between other animals. \nMoreover, it can also help predict the best angle for fertilisation, helping determine when copulation is used for reproduction and when it might simply be something animals indulge in for fun, or social bonding. \nThe team's research can be found in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dara orbach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d. orbach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orbach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle starr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "royal society b", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalhousie university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T04:41:58.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc555e3b6ed94af40b53091ddb28aa8f21c6d45d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG3gPgIK1znzFZ1V19MKv814UUoDtonlr8g0SN.7WkKeS.ov69t70xXdQnig6x4z046OM4K1qA9nQAFrr8yGVewjs3ePE.uEqb", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "This Is How Online Dating Has Changed The Very Fabric of Society", "title_full": "This Is How Online Dating Has Changed The Very Fabric of Society", "published": "2017-10-11T09:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/online_dating_network_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2243, "comments": 0, "shares": 2243}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 20}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc555e3b6ed94af40b53091ddb28aa8f21c6d45d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG3gPgIK1znzFZ1V19MKv814UUoDtonlr8g0SN.7WkKeS.ov69t70xXdQnig6x4z046OM4K1qA9nQAFrr8yGVewjs3ePE.uEqb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike McRae", "published": "2017-10-11T09:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Is How Online Dating Has Changed The Very Fabric of Society", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. Josue Ortega & Philipp Hergovich This Is How Online Dating Has Changed The Very Fabric of Society \nThe effects are significant. 11 OCT 2017 \nDigital match-making services have done more than just change how we find our perfect squeeze; they're changing the fundamental nature of our social networks. \nAccording to a pair of researchers investigating online dating, the way we're looking for love (and lust) is connecting communities in completely novel ways, breaking down boundaries and possibly even making for stronger long-term relationships. \nIt wasn't all that long ago that most relationships would begin with a smile and a handshake, rather than a click or a swipe. \nThat began to change in the mid-1990s, when websites like Match.com merged traditional lonely-heart classifieds with the convenience of the internet. \nToday there's a wide variety of sites and apps to suit your tastes, lifestyle, sexuality, and budget, from Tinder and Bumble for a quick swipe to like, to OKCupid and eHarmony for those who want their wit to show with their words. \nAny stigma over online dating has slowly evaporated over the years. 15 percent of Americans admit to having used online dating, and 5 percent of those who are married or committed long-term relationships stating they met their spouse online. \nNot only has digital technology made dating easier for romantic hopefuls, the data collected by such sites has been a boon for researchers curious about human mating habits. \nBut it's clear that the digital revolution hasn't only been shaped by the human appetite for sex and companionship; it's changed the way we form relationships. \nEconomists Josue Ortega from the University of Essex and Philipp Hergovich from the University of Vienna wanted to know just how the rise of digital match-making has affected the nature of society. \nSociety can be modelled as a web of interlinked nodes, where individuals are the node and the link describes how well they know one another. \nMost people are tightly connected with about a hundred nodes , including close friends and family, and loosely connected with others. \nWe can trace pathways through relationships to all come to Kevin Bacon \u2013 or nearly any other figure on the planet \u2013 in surprisingly few steps. \n\"Those weak ties serve as bridges between our group of close friends and other clustered groups, allowing us to connect to the global community,\" Ortega and Hergovich told MIT Technology Review . \nEven just a few decades ago most new connections were just a jump or two away inside an existing network. A bar, a sporting team, church, or college would typically provide the perfect environment for those first hot sparks. \nNot any more. \nFor heterosexual couples, online dating has risen to second place \u2013 just below 'met through friends' \u2013 as the context for that first introduction. Among homosexual couples, digital match-making has skyrocketed. \nJosue Ortega/University of Essex, Philipp Hergovich/University of Vienna \nAnd the knock-on effect is profound. \n\"People who meet online tend to be complete strangers,\" say the researchers . \nAs far as networks go, this is like building new highways between towns, rather than taking the local backroads. Just a few random new paths between different node villages can completely change how a network functions. \nTake interracial relationships, for example, long held to be a measure of the general social distances within a population. \nOnce illegal in many states, and long taboo, marriage between different ethnic groups in the US has slowly been on the rise since the mid-20th century. \nThe increase steepened at the turn of the 21st century in line with the rise in online dating, and then even further as swipe-to-match apps like Tinder went mainstream around 2014 (it launched in late 2012). \nWhile there are almost certainly a variety of influences, the network changes resulting from online dating fits the observations perfectly. \n\"Our model predicts nearly complete racial integration upon the emergence of online dating, even if the number of partners that individuals meet from newly formed ties is small,\" say Ortega and Hergovich . \nMarriages online were also predicted by the model to be more robust and less likely to end in divorce, a hypothesis which is supported by a study conducted in 2013 . \nThe study is currently available online on the pre-publish website arxiv.com , so it has not completed its full peer-review process just yet. \nIt can often seem as if the online world reinforces our echo chambers and leads us to become more insular, especially when it comes to social media. \nIt's nice to have some evidence that the relationships we make online are also breaking down boundaries and making for stronger connections.

These fields channel electromagnetic radiation into a beam that describes a circle with every rotation, much like a cosmic lighthouse. \nSeen from Earth, the stars seem to pulse with every sweep, giving them their name pulsar. Their positions and timing make for useful landmarks in space , not to mention handy cosmic clocks for testing general relativity . \nThe pair discovered by FAST \u2013 also dubbed FP1 and FP2 \u2013 don't stand out in terms of size, speed, or distance. \n\"FP1 is a pulsar with a spin period of 1.83 second and an estimated distance of 16 thousand light-years, and FP2, is a pulsar with a spin period of 0.59 second and an estimated distance of 4,100 light years,\" says deputy chief engineer of FAST, Li Di . \nFor a comparison, the fastest pulsar turns on its axis an insane 642 times per second. \nIn February the European Space Agency found a pulsar that was a thousand times brighter than ever thought possible, 50 million light years away. \nBut give it a chance \u2013 FAST exceeds the 305 metre wide Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico as the largest dish of its kind, so far more impressive discoveries are surely yet to come. \n\"The two new discovered pulsars symbolise the dawn of a new era of systematic discoveries by Chinese radio telescopes,\" says Yan Jun , director of the National Astronomical Observatories of China. \nThe US$185 million facility was built to collect radio waves washing over the planet from the far reaches of deep space, allowing researchers to pick up faint traces of radiation from ancient clouds of hydrogen gas, distant black holes, pulsars, or ... just maybe ... alien wifi. \nThe dish sits inside a giant sinkhole in Guizhou Province, southwest China, where limestone has dissolved away to leave a massive depression. \nThe stats are impressive; 4,450 panels give the dish a collection area of 196,000 square metres (about 2,109,700 square feet), more than doubling Arecibo's coverage. \nA bigger dish can collect more radio waves, which means detecting fainter signals; just the thing we need to see deeper into space, and therefore further back in time. \nThis hollow amid the surrounding hills provides a natural shelter from more Earthly radio waves, giving FAST a quiet spot to stare at the heavens. \nCloser to home, the giant dish could also be used to track spacecraft travelling to Mars as part of China's burgeoning space program. \nChina has been making extraordinary leaps in space-based technology in recent years, such as facilitating the first quantum-encrypted satellite link-up just a few weeks ago. \nEarlier this year the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation announced it would be conducting a record 30 launches into space this year, maintaining a trend in recent years that could see it meet its goal of landing technology on Mars by 2020 . \nFAST is just one more example of the nation's rapid progress in space technology. While it still has a few more tests to conduct to fine tune its processes, it won't be long before the facility is available to astronomers all over the globe. \nWe can't wait to see what else it discovers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "li di", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yan jun", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "arecibo observatory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european space agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china aerospace science and technology corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national astronomical observatories of china", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guizhou province", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arecibo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T23:00:27.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "407a890922ccc5449b396ca8a3fe0acea57e8164", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGh8a2f1mz6mT.RAAduLJ0E8kIp6kBsib0UVyJJY99219IdUXkFs1iDmceqxT9u4MHkZheLRQdllUUokSopRcrr65J4NUHb4z41ywqg5N2bas-", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "Astronomers Just Found an Epic Ring Around an Exotic Dwarf Planet in Our Solar System", "title_full": "Astronomers Just Found an Epic Ring Around an Exotic Dwarf Planet in Our Solar System", "published": "2017-10-11T13:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/725-haumea_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 10262, "comments": 0, "shares": 10262}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "407a890922ccc5449b396ca8a3fe0acea57e8164", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGh8a2f1mz6mT.RAAduLJ0E8kIp6kBsib0UVyJJY99219IdUXkFs1iDmceqxT9u4MHkZheLRQdllUUokSopRcrr65J4NUHb4z41ywqg5N2bas-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Peter Dockrill", "published": "2017-10-11T13:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Astronomers Just Found an Epic Ring Around an Exotic Dwarf Planet in Our Solar System", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd.

PETER DOCKRILL 11 OCT 2017 \nBeyond the orbit of Neptune there are hundreds or even thousands of mysterious dwarf planets , most of which we know almost nothing about \u2013 but there's a lot to learn when we catch a rare glimpse. \nToday, scientists are reporting the discovery of a vast ring encircling Haumea , a distant dwarf planet that takes some 284 Earth years to orbit the Sun, and it's the first time we've seen a ring in this category of minor planet. \nOf course, rings around larger worlds in the Solar System are common, and while Saturn's is the most famous and extensive, there are also ring systems around the other giant planets: Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. \nScientists have also previously identified two rings around an object called Chariklo , one of a population of small minor planets called Centaurs that orbit the Sun between Jupiter and Neptune. \nBut Haumea's ring is the first time astronomers have witnessed the phenomenon in a minor planet that isn't a Centaur. \nArtist's impression. Credit: IAA-CSIC/UHU \nThe discovery, led by astronomer Jose Luis Ortiz from the Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Andaluc\u00eda in Spain, took more than a little coordination to pull off. \nResearchers from 10 different labs observed Haumea with 12 different telescopes across Europe as it passed in front of a star called URAT1 533\u2013182543 \u2013 an event astronomers called an occultation . \nThe stellar backdrop took place in January this year, and the perspectives from 12 different angles enabled the team to observe the dwarf planet like never before, and gave us our first glimpse at its ring system. \nAccording to the team, Haumea's ring has a width of 70 kilometres (43.5 miles) and a radius of about 2,287 kilometres (1,421 miles), and the dwarf planet rotates three times on its axis in the time that a ring particle completes one revolution. \nThe occultation also provided the team with our best analysis yet of Haumea's size and shape, which the researchers describe as \"very exotic\". \nThey say the dwarf planet has an unusual elongated ellipsoid shape, with axes of approximately 2,322 kilometres (1,442 miles) by 1,704 kilometres (1,059 miles) by 1,138 kilometres (707 miles), and no global atmosphere that can be detected. \nArtist's impression. Credit: IAA-CSIC/UHU \nIn addition to the rings found around Chariklo, there's also evidence of a similar phenomenon around another Centaur called Chiron , although it's less clear than the Chariklo ring. \nAside from those instances, the Haumea ring is the first time we've detected this, so we're in some pretty unfamiliar territory \u2013 but the researchers hint we may be about to observe an amazing trend in the characteristics of these faraway, mysterious minor planets. \n\"The discovery of a ring around Haumea \u2013 a much more distant body, in a completely different dynamical class, much larger than Chariklo and Chiron, with satellites and with a very elongated triaxial shape \u2013 has numerous implications,\" the authors write in their paper , \"such as rings being possibly common also in the trans-Neptunian region from which Centaurs are delivered, and opens the door to new avenues of research.\" \nThe findings are reported in Nature .

All rights reserved. Ascension No, This Company Isn't Really Scattering Your Loved One's Ashes in Space \nBeautiful, but not high enough. MICHELLE STARR 11 OCT 2017 \nWant to have your ashes scattered in space? It's a beautiful concept, but this might not be the solution you're looking for. \nAnd, perhaps, we should also be careful about exactly how and where we do such a thing should we really start doing it properly. \nIt was the late, great Carl Sagan who wrote : \n\"All of the rocky and metallic material we stand on, the iron in our blood, the calcium in our teeth, the carbon in our genes were produced billions of years ago in the interior of a red giant star. We are made of star-stuff.\" \nFrom star-stuff we may have been made; but no, we're not going to be returning to star-stuff just yet, in spite of the claims of a new company. \nUnlike already established US-based space funeral companies Celestis and Elysium Space , which carry the ashes in orbit before returning to Earth, UK-based Ascension is offering a new type of funeral service, promising to scatter the ashes of the deceased in space. \n\"Scatter your loved one's ashes in space,\" the website's tagline reads. \nThe method of delivery is a helium high-altitude weather balloon that carries the cremated remains up into the sky, to a maximum altitude of around 35 kilometres (115,000 feet, or 22 miles), in the stratosphere. \nAscension \nThis, the company says , is officially in \"near space,\" because it's past the Armstrong limit at 19 kilometres (62,000 feet) altitude. After this point, the atmosphere is so thin that water starts to boil at human body temperatures. Humans cannot survive without a pressure suit. \nBut experts disagree with this definition. \n\"I wouldn't say the Armstrong limit is considered a border between the atmosphere and space. Just as an example, Australia's current space legislation defines the beginning of space at 100 km, four times higher again,\" space archaeologist Alice Gorman of Flinders University told ScienceAlert. \n\"This is also known as the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line - it divides space from the air, so below this you generally have aviation regulation as opposed to space treaties governing what people do.\" \nThis line is an important one. When you cross it, the atmosphere thins to the point that aerodynamics, the science of moving through air, no longer applies, and astrodynamics, the science of moving through space, takes over. \n\"That's the limit where astronauts get their 'wings' badges,\" Michael Brown, an astronomer at Monash University, told ScienceAlert. \nBoth NASA and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale use the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line as the boundary that marks an astronaut. \nSo how does this 'space funeral' work? When the balloon reaches its maximum altitude, the cannister will open, releasing the ashes inside. \nMost of the material, Ascension says on its website, will scatter across the Earth. The cannister, equipped with GPS trackers, will also fall back down, to be retrieved by the Ascension team, with a portion of the remains for the family to keep. \nExperiments with non-human ashes, according to the company , have found that some particles can escape upwards and into orbit, although Gorman notes that, while that's possible, there's no real way of knowing for sure. \nBut she also notes that scattering ashes in space is probably not the best idea to start with. \n\"If ashes were scattered in orbit, which these are not, then they'd join the millions of tiny bits of space junk which are traveling at speeds of 7-8 km per second,\" she said. \n\"Junk this size causes damage to spacecraft by constant bombardment. Each impact is trivial but there's a cumulative effect. Fortunately in Low Earth Orbit, this stuff usually enters the Earth's atmosphere quickly.\" \nBased on the company's website, the service does actually look quite beautiful. It just might not be quite the \"scattering your loved one's ashes in space\" you might have hoped for. \n\"I'm a 'space' purist and want at least 100 kilometre altitude,\" Brown noted. \"Can't say I'm a fan of the [website's] tagline, since they are well below the 100 kilometre limit.\" \nGorman concurred. \n\"I'd probably expect a lot higher if I were being told my ashes were going into space,\" Gorman said, \"but I quite like the imagination of their scheme.\" \nAt time of publication, Ascension have not yet replied to our request for comment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice gorman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carl sagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gorman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle starr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "armstrong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "celestis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monash university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flinders university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elysium space", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "f\u00e9d\u00e9ration a\u00e9ronautique internationale", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "k\u00e1rm\u00e1n", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "low earth orbit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T02:50:36.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b114e33123609c19e5bb5836c6df0ad6e17e530f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGUC9_eI9046TXS4Sj6wVRfAuB.9EBlpgcxezzH8HOnEI4CtfYZVYYpAHY72OOqEoYJg0yvAs0zZyURZA06gEiMf38IlxDLST0", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "There's Another Big Gravitational Wave Announcement on The Way", "title_full": "There's Another Big Gravitational Wave Announcement on The Way", "published": "2017-10-12T07:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/supernova_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1945, "comments": 0, "shares": 1945}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b114e33123609c19e5bb5836c6df0ad6e17e530f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGUC9_eI9046TXS4Sj6wVRfAuB.9EBlpgcxezzH8HOnEI4CtfYZVYYpAHY72OOqEoYJg0yvAs0zZyURZA06gEiMf38IlxDLST0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michelle Starr", "published": "2017-10-12T07:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "There's Another Big Gravitational Wave Announcement on The Way", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd.

They study found that the original thought patterns and levels of learning came back within minutes. \n\"We were shocked by the results and how quickly the effects of the stimulation could be reversed,\" says Reinhart . \nWhile these initial results so far are interesting, researchers have a long way to go to see if these brain sync boosts can be scaled up and are safe enough to be used in the long term, or indeed if they apply beyond the simple task of pressing a button every 1.7 seconds. \nBut even though it's early days, the potential is intriguing. \nConditions like anxiety, Parkinson's, autism, schizophrenia, ADHD, and Alzheimer's all show signs of disrupted brain oscillations, and a treatment like this could help, as well as being more precise in focus than existing drugs. \nThen there's the question of whether it could give healthy brains a boost in their thought processes \u2013 we're not close to that yet, but it's a possibility. \n\"Think about any given workday,\" says David Somers , also from Boston University, who wasn't directly involved in the research. \"You need to be really 'on' for one meeting, so you set aside some time on your lunch break for some brain stimulation.\" \n\"I think a lot of people would be really into that \u2013 it would be like three cups of coffee without the jitters.\" \nThe research has been published in PNAS .

SIGNE DEAN 12 OCT 2017 \nTurns out there's a fine line between 'screaming at the top of your lungs' and 'screaming until your lungs collapse'. \nA 16-year-old girl in Texas recently landed in the emergency department with a puzzling shortness of breath but no chest pain or other apparent problems. The doctors quickly learned that the night before she'd been yelling at a One Direction concert, leading to a truly bizarre diagnosis. \nThe patient had no history of lung conditions, not even a cough or a sore throat. Despite the shortness of breath - which prompted her to go to the hospital after it didn't resolve overnight - doctors heard no weird sounds in her breathing and noted \"no respiratory distress\". \nBut a physical examination did reveal one unexpected symptom - the doctor could hear a crunchy crackling sound under her skin upon pressing fingers on the front of the girl's neck and chest. \nThis symptom is called \"subcutaneus crepitus\" , and it's an indication that air has travelled into the tissue right underneath the skin. When you press on it, the air bubbles are popped, causing a crackling sound. \nAn X-ray confirmed that air had indeed travelled to a bunch of wrong places, and could be found in the narrow space behind the pharynx in the neck, and in the chest cavity. \nOn top of that, both of her lungs had also very slightly collapsed, which happens when air gets trapped between the chest walls and the lung itself. \nAs the doctors noted in their case report, these are three separate diagnoses, and when air gets spontaneously (that is, without obvious trauma) trapped in any one of those spaces, that's already deemed to be an uncommon event. \n\"The combination of all three diagnoses has yet to be described in medical literature,\" they write in the report . \nBut it gets even weirder. To find out how the air escaped from the lungs (presumably through a hole or a tear somewhere in the respiratory tract), the team performed a CT scan , only to reveal\u2026 nothing. \nBecause the patient had type 1 diabetes, the doctors hypothesised that there could be a tear in the respiratory tract caused by the deep and laboured breathing people with diabetes can experience if their blood sugar goes too high and sends them into a state called ketoacidosis, when the blood is too acidic. \nBut blood sugar tests revealed the girl had no acidosis, so the doctors were stumped. \nAs the lead doctor J. Mack Slaughter Jr. hypothesised in conversation with Live Science , it's possible that there's a very small hole somewhere in the respiratory tract that would only open when enough force was applied (like screaming over your favourite band) but closed up again afterwards. We'll probably never know. \nThankfully, despite how dramatic all this sounds, none of this turned out to be a life-threatening problem. \nMild lung collapses, such as the one this girl experienced, usually don't require much treatment other than observation at the hospital and giving the body extra oxygen to help the lungs recover. So that's what the doctors did, and the girl was soon fine to go home. \n\"After an uneventful period of observation with an unchanged repeat chest x-ray study, the patient was discharged the following day with no further visits for this problem,\" the team noted in the report. \nWhat makes this case useful to medicine is the truly unusual way in how air ended up trapped in the girl's neck. According to the doctors, there's only one other case when this happened spontaneously, and that time it was during singing. \nMeanwhile, spontaneous and mild lung collapses have been known to happen due to things like diving, weight lifting, and military flying, but after this case the team suggests that \"forceful screaming during pop concerts should be added to that list.\" \nThe case study was published in The Journal of Emergency Medicine .

Wisanu Boonrawd/Shutterstock Yellowstone's Supervolcano Could Give Less Warning of an Eruption Than We Thought \nDamn. 12 OCT 2017 \nBeneath Yellowstone National Park, a beast slumbers. Recent rumblings might be of interest to volcanologists, but for those fearing a cataclysmic eruption it seems as if we have little to worry about. For now. \nBut new research has forced a rethink on just how much time we would have up our sleeves should Yellowstone's supervolcano show signs of waking. The short answer \u2013 not as long as we'd thought. \nResearchers from Arizona State University presented their findings at the 2017 International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of Earth's Interior conference in Oregon last month. \nAn analysis of fossilised ash deposits taken from Yellowstone's Lava Creek Tuff revealed crystals left over from a previous eruption some 630,000 years ago. \nThe sizes of crystals reflect changes in temperature of their surroundings, so measuring the different crystals in layers of rock sample can tell a story of heating and pressure over a period of time. \nIn this case, the time between a fresh injection of hot magma from deep underground and eruption was measurable in decades, suggesting the first volcanologists to discover Yellowstone was stirring might live long enough to see her blow her top. \n\"It's shocking how little time is required to take a volcanic system from being quiet and sitting there to the edge of an eruption,\" researcher Hannah Shamloo told Shannon Hall at the New York Times . \nPrevious research indicated the time between a magma recharge and supervolcano Armageddon could be as long as a few millennia to just a few centuries . \nSupervolcanos are basically normal volcanos on steroids, spread out over a wider area underground. \nBy the textbook, they're volcanic centres that have an eruption of magnitude 8 on the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI). \nThat means it can vomit up more than 1,000 cubic kilometres (240 cubic miles) of hot rock and ash. \nBy comparison, the 1883 Krakatoa eruption was only a VEI 6 event , ejecting about 20 cubic kilometres of material. \nAbout 640,000 years ago , Yellowstone's supervolcano blew out a chunk of the crust that left a caldera about 50 by 70 kilometres (roughly 30 by 45 miles) in size, which was quickly filled with lava. \nIts last eruption was 174,000 ago, though lava was still flowing up until 70,000 years ago. \nToday it's relatively quiet, with no indication of an imminent repeat of past tantrums. We might have more to worry about from Italy's Campi Flegrei supervolcano than the behemoth beneath Yellowstone. \nGeologists are keeping a close eye on its seismic activity, however, and researchers are considering ways to help Yellowstone keep its cool should it start to heat up again in the future. \nAs unlikely as an eruption might be in the near future, a repeat VEI 8 event would be a rather bad day for humanity, throwing enough ash into the atmosphere to make our current climate change problems a low priority. \nNot to mention the hell that would be unleashed on the surrounding US states of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. \nHaving better models on the timing and volcanic processes would help narrow down predictions and establish possible measures that might buy time, if not head off another eruption completely. \nThis research is a step in that direction, but far more evidence is needed. \n\"It's one thing to think about this slow gradual buildup \u2013 it's another thing to think about how you mobilise 1,000 cubic kilometres of magma in a decade,\" says geochemist Kari Cooper , who wasn't involved in the research. \nThat's a lot of hot rock oozing underfoot, and geologists are still learning how all that moving magma transforms into an Earth-shattering boom. \nLet's hope we still have plenty more decades to figure it out.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T03:01:12.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "11672da8d99d2c9d2af803039d9f3fd05440c4c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG51WIgJtGbehPab.XXcGubNmLHeWi7eGakulVn8h0WU1890M4Wu4cSc0MYM.11y5Xoznvw.FCBsfdXjidXYDF44YnBe34C83DfTCsLjqIO4Q-", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "ScienceAlert Deal: Check Out This Comprehensive IT Career Kickstarter Bundle", "title_full": "ScienceAlert Deal: Check Out This Comprehensive IT Career Kickstarter Bundle", "published": "2017-10-13T12:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/shutterstock_114395443_1_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 102, "comments": 0, "shares": 102}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11672da8d99d2c9d2af803039d9f3fd05440c4c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG51WIgJtGbehPab.XXcGubNmLHeWi7eGakulVn8h0WU1890M4Wu4cSc0MYM.11y5Xoznvw.FCBsfdXjidXYDF44YnBe34C83DfTCsLjqIO4Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ScienceAlert Staff", "published": "2017-10-13T12:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "ScienceAlert Deal: Check Out This Comprehensive IT Career Kickstarter Bundle", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd.

All rights reserved. A fragment of a woven sash. (Annika Larsson/Uppsala University) The Word 'Allah' Has Been Discovered Woven Into Viking Burial Clothes Okay, we're surprised. 13 OCT 2017 Ancient burial clothes thought to have been woven with typical Viking patterns have, after decades in storage, revealed a surprise: geometric Kufic script spelling out the words \"Ali\" and \"Allah,\" woven in silver thread onto silk. It's the first time historic artefacts mentioning \"Ali\" have been found in Scandinavia, marking this as an important archaeological discovery. \nWhile at first glance this appears to be a surprising find, it doesn't even seem that uncommon - the script was found on at least 10 silk clothing items out of 100 from 9th and 10th century boat graves around Gamla, Uppsala, as well as chamber graves in Viking Era sites such as Birka in Swedish M\u00e4lardalen. \nThe discovery was made when a team of researchers was trying to recreate the patterns on burial garments in storage for the then upcoming Viking Couture exhibit at Enk\u00f6ping Museum in Sweden. \n\"This is a very important discovery because it tells us we can't view this historical period as 'typically Nordic',\" Annika Larsson, a textile archaeologist at Uppsala University, told The Local . \n\"It shows us that the Vikings were in close contact with other cultures, including with the Islamic world.\" \nEvidence for a connection between the Vikings and the Muslim world has been mounting for years now. \nIn 2009 , researchers found that Viking Ara swords used Arab metalsmithing techniques, probably transferred via the Volga trade route . \nPersian silk has also been found in a Viking longboat burial in Norway . \nInitially, Larsson said, she couldn't make sense of the designs, but then she remembered where she had seen something similar: on Moorish textiles from Spain. \nAnalysis of the materials, weaving techniques and designs suggest Central Asian and Persian origin. \nAnnika Larsson, Uppsala University \nThe word \"Ali\" was relatively easy to decipher, but Allah was a little more tricky - because it had been mirrored, as seen in the image above. \nThe reason for this is unknown, but the most likely explanation is that the pattern had simply been copied incorrectly, as Amir De Martino of the Islamic College in London told the BBC . \nLarsson believes that the presence of the names on the garments, always appearing together, indicate that the Vikings didn't just trade goods with the Muslim world, but perhaps also burial customs and ideas. \n\"Presumably, Viking Age burial customs were influenced by Islam and the idea of an eternal life in Paradise after death,\" she said in a statement . \n\"Grave goods such as beautiful clothing, finely sewn in exotic fabrics, hardly reflect the deceased's everyday life, just as little as the formal attire of our era reflects our own daily lives. The rich material of grave goods should rather be seen as tangible expressions of underlying values.\" \nIt's not uncommon for graves to include objects and clothing as opulent and rich as the family could afford. \nFurther analysis will be required to learn more, and this is being carried out on the people who were buried with the garments to determine whether they was people from Persia or - much more likely - Vikings wearing Islamic textiles. \n\"The quality of Islamic silk textiles was such that they were highly coveted and used in Christian churches across Europe, and for vestments,\" dress and textile historian Hilary Davidson of the University of Sydney, who is researching transmisson of Islamic and Byzantine textiles in medieval Christian clothing, told ScienceAlert. \n\"They were valued for their quality and beauty, not their religious context, which in any case became divorced through trading patterns. These silks were traded across Europe for centuries, and it is possible that the Norse Kufic patterns are imitating the pattern of Islamic textiles without knowing what the meaning is. \n\"They might be trade goods applied to Viking clothing as examples of high status, high quality silk and metal textiles.\" \nNow that the presence of the patterns is known, it may be easier in the future to identify it in other textiles, and perhaps even other artefacts. \nLarsson's finding are currently on display as part of the Viking Couture exhibition at Enk\u00f6ping Museum , which runs until 3 February, 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T08:52:23.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "742eac7ec57d98edbf3850d9cd2b26601bf3bca8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGRO8H6nRqMW_ImM2BQzFP4UbmsUCjuaO3buHlEEtWmR2jrVkg1WmqkNBApH9ZIyZPUTwklX67AKk30ctV3JPexplLyf0F9iApnc9bNVQD5LU-", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "This Amazing New Material Changes Shape Just Like an Octopus", "title_full": "This Amazing New Material Changes Shape Just Like an Octopus", "published": "2017-10-12T12:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/octopus1_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 607, "comments": 0, "shares": 607}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "742eac7ec57d98edbf3850d9cd2b26601bf3bca8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGRO8H6nRqMW_ImM2BQzFP4UbmsUCjuaO3buHlEEtWmR2jrVkg1WmqkNBApH9ZIyZPUTwklX67AKk30ctV3JPexplLyf0F9iApnc9bNVQD5LU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michelle Starr", "published": "2017-10-12T12:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Amazing New Material Changes Shape Just Like an Octopus", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd.

MICHELLE STARR 12 OCT 2017 \nIf you're going to make camouflage, may as well copy from the best, and one of the best the world has to offer is our peculiar eight-armed pal the octopus. \nEngineers have been inspired by the cephalopod's ability to change the texture and colour of its skin to create a new, programmable material that can morph from 2D to 3D and blend in with its environment. \nCephalopods such as octopuses and cuttlefish are the true masters of animal disguise (we've included some videos down the end for your enjoyment). \nThanks to colour-changing chromatophores in their skin, as well as light-reflecting iridophores and leucophores, they can alter their colour in a second, which is useful for menacing predators as well as hiding. \nTheir other trick is changing the shape of their skin. Their skin has highly muscular sections called papillae that can be deformed to change the texture of the animal's skin, even drastically altering it and appearing to change its shape. \nBy expressing their papillae, octopuses and cuttlefish can blend into rocks and corals, and even mimic other sea creatures. For the soft and squishy cephalopods, it's their primary defence mechanism. It's the work of these papillae that engineers from Cornell University, led by James Pikul and Robert Shepherd , have drawn on for their new material. \n\"Lots of animals have papillae, but they can't extend and retract them instantaneously as octopus and cuttlefish do,\" said cephalopod biologist Roger Hanlon of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, who collaborated with the engineers. \nIn the European cuttlefish, he explained, there are at least nine sets of these papillae, each of which can transform from a flat two-dimensional skin to one of about a dozen different shapes, all controlled individually. \nThe team's material, shown in the image below, consists of a fiber mesh embedded in silicone rubber. This mesh is layered in such a way that sections are constrained during the transformation process, allowing some parts to expand when activated when inflated with air - much like the muscles in the skin of an octopus. \nShepherd et al., Science \n\"Engineers have developed a lot of sophisticated ways to control the shape of soft, stretchable materials, but we wanted to do it in a simple way that was fast, strong, and easy to control,\" said lead researcher James Pikul , now of the University of Pennsylvania. \n\"We were drawn by how successful cephalopods are at changing their skin texture, so we studied and drew inspiration from the muscles that allow cephalopods to control their texture, and implemented these ideas into a method for controlling the shape of soft, stretchable materials.\" \nThe team created two iterations of their idea: one that can form into the shape of grey pebbles, and another that forms into the shape of the succulent plant Graptoveria amethorum . \nBut it could be scaled up quite easily, and implemented with any pair of materials that have the stretching response, the team wrote in their paper. These could include hydrogels, for instance. \nAs to applications for the material, it could be used for transforming 3D displays, or to help study animals in the wild while disrupting their environment as little as possible. \nDoubtless there are also potential military applications for the material, given that the research was funded by the US Army Research Office and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research. \nThat's a way into the future, though. Although we know the mechanisms whereby octopuses and cuttlefish can change their shape and colour, it turns out replicating those mechanisms is a very tricky thing to accomplish indeed. \nThe research has been published this week in the journal Science .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T08:52:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d55694c039d9c51c10fd9928f3f50d008461ea24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGo4CQo3oMWzxCq5PDTsv3vPTJHhMcF70ISTvaKoN6lWRgCl4dVtCYk80rSaV1SJAANQfcIkGuViTkJalf4TtCYU4OLRKMeMN3CcT4W1T7Mv4-", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "NASA Is Putting 12 Volunteers in Downwards Angled Beds For a Whole Month", "title_full": "NASA Is Putting 12 Volunteers in Downwards Angled Beds For a Whole Month", "published": "2017-10-13T10:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/nasa-bedrest-study-tilted-bed-cover_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 8, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 872, "comments": 0, "shares": 872}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d55694c039d9c51c10fd9928f3f50d008461ea24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGo4CQo3oMWzxCq5PDTsv3vPTJHhMcF70ISTvaKoN6lWRgCl4dVtCYk80rSaV1SJAANQfcIkGuViTkJalf4TtCYU4OLRKMeMN3CcT4W1T7Mv4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Signe Dean", "published": "2017-10-13T10:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "NASA Is Putting 12 Volunteers in Downwards Angled Beds For a Whole Month", "text": "NASA Is Putting 12 Volunteers in Downwards Angled Beds For a Whole Month \nThat looks really uncomfortable. 13 OCT 2017 \nLying in bed in the name of science may sound like a dream job, but when you're volunteering to do that for NASA, there's inevitably going to be a catch. \nThe space agency's latest bed rest study is meant to investigate the effects of fluid pressure on the eyes and optic nerves of astronauts. To do that, participants must spend 30 days not getting up from a bed - but it's not as fun as it sounds. \nTwelve volunteers will be spending a solid month in large beds that are tilted downwards at a six-degree angle, and they must remain in that position the whole time. \nNo getting up to pee or shower. No sitting upright to have their meals. \nAnd in addition to the posture, the participants will also be breathing air that's much higher in carbon dioxide (CO2) - 0.5 percent as opposed to the mere 0.04 percent we get with our normal everyday Earth air. \nAll this is meant to produce an adaptive response in the body akin to what happens to astronauts living in microgravity. The reason for the altered CO2 levels is part of the strategy, since on the International Space Station CO2 levels also tend to be higher than down on the planet. \n\"These conditions will mimic the environment thought to cause vision problems experienced by some astronauts,\" NASA explains in a statement . \nThe new study is part of the agency's Flight Analogs Program, which is exactly what it sounds like - studying the effects of spaceflight on the human body in analog environments here on Earth. \nThe bedrest marathon will take place at German Space Agency's state of the art facility :envihab , where participants will be spending time in their specially equipped bedrooms with no visitors allowed on site (although they can keep their phones). \nThe volunteers have been arriving at the facility this week, and will go through two weeks of baseline data collection before being confined to bed rest in a staggered schedule of two subjects per day. \nAll participants will be closely monitored to let researchers better understand the changes a person's body undergoes in space, especially when it comes to pressure on the eyes and the optic nerve. \n\"There is continuous data collection including several MRIs to observe potential changes in either brain or eye structures,\" states NASA . \n\"Blood pressure, heart rate, nutrient absorption, energy expenditure, bone mass and even the participants' mood will also be monitored.\" \nIf you ever dream of just ditching life's obligations and staying in bed with some Netflix on your laptop and a pile of junk food, this wouldn't be the way to do it, since even the participant's diets will be strictly controlled, giving them \"little choice as to what or when they eat.\" \nBut hey, nobody said astronauts have it easy . \nThis is not the first time NASA has done a bed rest study, and they're not even the only organisation to do this kind of science. \nLast year the Institute for Space Medicine and Physiology in France was recruiting 24 volunteers for a similar 60-day stint, and there is even a report from the field by one man who participated in a 70-day bedrest study for NASA. \nAs test subject Andrew Iwanicki described in his report for Vice , at first it was one of the most relaxing times in his adult life, but as the weeks drew on, boredom and monotony settled in, followed by an intense frustration over the extremely strict diet. \nThankfully these volunteers will only be in bed for a third of that time, and we're looking forward to finding out what the scientists may learn about vision problems in astronauts. \n\"Many participants want to do their part to support space travel,\" explains NASA . \n\"If humans ever walk on Mars or live in space for long periods, it is in part, thanks to the bed rest volunteers.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T09:19:07.453+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62c71adb90b9300276b2a7084c0ff7669498dbad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG3gPgIK1znzGhrTW3XKAp91Yjwi73nkXhwNmQ5Rnqjxf7g8SdwS_XtZl4BRGcRqqAcgMkURlg26mieYJbjNTvc8UOH07DZvS_Dxsi7XZ75Bfx7GKUuUHqkg--", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "We Just Got a New Spin Test For Detecting Particles That Are Their Own Antiparticles", "title_full": "We Just Got a New Spin Test For Detecting Particles That Are Their Own Antiparticles", "published": "2017-10-13T12:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/abstract_particles_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1008, "comments": 0, "shares": 1008}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62c71adb90b9300276b2a7084c0ff7669498dbad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoG3gPgIK1znzGhrTW3XKAp91Yjwi73nkXhwNmQ5Rnqjxf7g8SdwS_XtZl4BRGcRqqAcgMkURlg26mieYJbjNTvc8UOH07DZvS_Dxsi7XZ75Bfx7GKUuUHqkg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike McRae", "published": "2017-10-13T12:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "We Just Got a New Spin Test For Detecting Particles That Are Their Own Antiparticles", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. chaoss/Shutterstock We Just Got a New Spin Test For Detecting Particles That Are Their Own Antiparticles \nA win for quantum computing. MIKE MCRAE 13 OCT 2017 \nThe discovery of a unique property in what's known as a Majorana fermion has given researchers an easy way to spot the real deal from a fraud. \nSuch particles are famous for being their own antiparticle, a feature that makes them appealing candidates for qubits in certain kinds of quantum computers. But until now identifying them from look-alikes has been no trivial task. \nA team of researchers, headed by physicists from Princeton University in the US, discovered that pairs of Majorana particles separated at each end of a line of iron atoms should have a distinctive spin. \nTouching each particle with the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope could then be used to reveal this property to reveal if they're bonafide or not. \nReally, we should be writing it as Majorana 'particle'. Or, to really get our jargon on, a Majorana zero mode (MZM). \nUnlike other fermions in the subatomic zoo, such as leptons and quarks, these exotic objects are quasiparticles , formed by the collective properties of electrons under certain conditions. \nThat doesn't make a huge difference in the end. Like other forms of matter and antimatter, MZMs would cancel out in a puff of energy if they were to mingle. \nEver since the theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana predicted the existence of neutrally charged particles that are also antiparticles in 1937, the race has been on to find one in the wild. \nElectrons have antielectrons \u2013 or positrons \u2013 and quarks have antiquarks , but so far nobody has found such a single type of fermion that is two-in-one. \nFor most practical purposes, MZMs serve as the next best thing. \nA robust type of quantum computing that uses the twisting paths of neutral particles through 2D space could be based on these quasiparticle version of the Majorana fermion. \nThe only catch is their production can result in an actual MZM, or some sort of quasiparticle that doesn't quite have the same goods. \nThis has made it tricky to confirm their existence in the past, so while hints of the quasiparticle have popped up over the years , it's only recently that physicists have been confident of its existence . \nSeveral years ago, the researchers designed a method for producing MZMs in a single dimensional chain of iron atoms embedded on a lead crystal surface, forming what's known as a topological superconductor. \nThe resulting behaviour of the electrons in this iron wire under a magnetic field gave rise to a Majorana fermion quasiparticle at each end. \nTo be confident that the quasiparticles were in fact behaving like a pair of Majorana fermions, the researchers had to conduct a number of control experiments. Even then they still couldn't be certain the MZM wasn't a lookalike. \nNow, they've demonstrated its spin property will stand out enough to act as a perfect signature. \n\"It turns out that, unlike in the case of a conventional quasiparticle, the spin of the Majorana cannot be screened out by the background,\" says researcher Andrei Bernevig . \n\"In this sense it is a litmus test for the presence of the Majorana state.\" \nSpin is a quantum property that describes a particle's specific degree of freedom, a little like whether it can go up and down, or back and forth. \nIt's a particle's spin that can determine what category it belongs to. \nThe researchers used an instrument that brought individual atoms so close to one another, the vague positions of their electrons effectively jumped or 'tunnelled' through the empty space, creating a channel. \nBy manipulating the magnetic field of this scanning tunnelling microscope, this channel could respond to the spin of the particles and provide information on whether or not they were another kind of quasiparticle. \n\"Our aim has been to probe some of the specific quantum properties of Majoranas. Such experiments provide not only further confirmation of their existence in our chains, but open up possible ways of using them,\" says researcher Ali Yazdani . \nNo doubt we'll be hearing a lot more about this particle-antiparticle-quasiparticle in the future. \nThis research was published in Science .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T09:20:03.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "669e6673978c9d162062a53e057d14aed894f072", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGmLT9Ju1lw5Pm_2.gft6Np2xzxVmZ_.Z0b05jDSkgCywQ97MsL1KxaAx6dxhWQupeUrwHSVkfP_A855wLTSlXmK4WbHDJCBC8NBW1xT1D4c8-", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Here's what Americans are most scared of in 2017 and no, it's not spiders - ScienceAlert", "title_full": "Here's what Americans are most scared of in 2017 and no, it's not spiders - ScienceAlert", "published": "2017-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.782, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/thomas-roberts-338411_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 666, "comments": 0, "shares": 666}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "669e6673978c9d162062a53e057d14aed894f072", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGmLT9Ju1lw5Pm_2.gft6Np2xzxVmZ_.Z0b05jDSkgCywQ97MsL1KxaAx6dxhWQupeUrwHSVkfP_A855wLTSlXmK4WbHDJCBC8NBW1xT1D4c8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Nield", "published": "2017-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here's what Americans are most scared of in 2017 and no, it's not spiders - ScienceAlert", "text": "Here's What Americans Are Most Scared of in 2017 And No, It's Not Spiders \nHold us. 11 OCT 2017 \nFor the fourth year running, Chapman University in California has run its Survey of American Fears, polling 1,207 adults from across the US about what they're most scared of and what keeps them awake at night. \nIt makes for pretty grim reading, though the classic sources of nightmare fuel \u2013 spiders, evil clowns, monsters under the bed \u2013 have largely been pushed out of the list to be replaced by fears that are much more relevant to our times. \n\"The 2017 survey data shows us that while some of the top fears have remained, there has also been a pronounced shift to environmental fears,\" says lead researcher Christopher Bader. \n\"We are beginning to see trends that people tend to fear what they are exposed to in the media. Many of the top 10 fears this year can be directly correlated to the top media stories of the past year.\" \nWithout any further ado, here's the top 10 rundown, in reverse order. In brackets, you can see the percentage of Americans who are \"afraid or very afraid\" of each entry. \n10. Air pollution (44.9 percent) \nAir pollution is a huge problem in many urban areas across the world , and worries about the quality of the air we breathe are propping up the top 10. The burning of fossil fuels, petrol-guzzling forms of transport, and natural disasters are all contributing to the effect. \n9. North Korea using weapons (47.5 percent) \nIt's not been a great year for world peace, with the sabre-rattling rhetoric exchanged between US President Donald Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un showing no signs of ending. A weapons strike is on the mind of nearly half of Americans. \n8. Global warming and climate change (48 percent) \nUnless you're living a lot of your life under a rock, it's hard to ignore news headlines about global warming and climate change, whether it's collapsing glaciers , dying coral reefs , or record-breaking temperatures . Let's hope it's not too late to do something about it . \n7. The US will be involved in another world war (48.4 percent) \nSee also number 9 \u2013 many Americans are afraid or very afraid of a looming global conflict which won't benefit anyone involved. We're trusting our government leaders to learn the lessons from the past and all get along, because ultimately everyone suffers from war . \n6. High medical bills (48.4 percent) \nA hot political topic right now, and one that scares almost half of Americans on a regular basis. Unfortunately illnesses and accidents aren't particularly choosy about who they end up affecting, but we've seen some encouraging health developments this year as well. \n5. Not having enough money in the future (50.2 percent) \nMoney might not bring you happiness, but it makes life a little more comfortable, and at this point we tip the scales on fears that more than half of Americans share. \nPeople really don't feel secure about their future financial outlook. We're no financial experts, so the only advice we can offer is to put more value in your time . \n4. Pollution of drinking water (50.4 percent) \nAnother issue that's been in the news this year, thanks to the terrible events in Flint, Michigan, and this is a new entry in the top 10 for 2017. The situation is slowly getting better , but replacing all of the pipelines that need to be upgraded will take years. \n3. Pollution of oceans, rivers, and lakes (53.1 percent) \nAnother fear centred around pollution, and another new entry in the top 10 this year, which isn't surprising considering the news reports we've seen about the plastics in our oceans and the detrimental effects that human activity is having on marine life . \n2. American Healthcare Act (55.3 percent) \nVery much a fear related to the current political climate in the US, and one that's shared by well over half the population, according to the Chapman University survey. For now, the debate continues over the rights and wrongs of the Act in the United States Senate. \n1. Corruption of government officials (74.5 percent) \nAnd in at number one \u2013 for the third year in a row, and by some distance \u2013 is a fear of corruption in government officials. Politicians, why do you seem so untrustworthy? The possibility of corruption is playing on the minds of nearly three-quarters of Americans. \nCredit: Chapman University \nSo there you have it \u2013 how many fears do you share? You can view the whole list online , including heights at 34, public speaking at 52, and unfathomable technology in at 64 (well, we've all been there ). \nAs part of their research, the team from Chapman University also found that 52 percent of Americans believe that places can be haunted by spirits, and that more than a quarter of people (26 percent) think that aliens have been to Earth in modern times. \nWe can only assume as aliens don't appear anywhere in the top 80 fears that the people who believe in their existence aren't worried about their intentions. \nAnd if you need a palate cleanser after all of that negativity, here's a video of a cute-looking squid to take your mind somewhere else.

All rights reserved. nattanan726/Shutterstock Here's What Can Happen to Your Brain And Body When You Shoot a Gun \nIt's a full-on experience. 13 OCT 2017 \nYou look down the sight of a gun, take aim, slowly exhale, and pull the trigger. \nWhat happens next is an explosion of sensations, from a bright muzzle flash and body-jolting recoil to an ear-splitting bang and acrid smell of burnt gunpowder. \nAbout 72 percent of US adults have fired a gun, according to a June 2017 Pew Research Center survey that reached nearly 4,000 respondents. \nThis means most of America is familiar with the experience - including the mental and emotional head-rush that often comes with it. \n\"The whole idea of training is to get people over these sensations, whether they're a police officer-in-training or military personnel,\" Kevin Fleming, a neuroscientist at Norwich University (a military college) who's researched gun violence and the psychology of shooting firearms for more than 25 years, told Business Insider. \nAlthough everyone's experience is different - especially when it comes to a firing range versus a real-life threat (perceived or otherwise) - here are a few effects that shooting a firearm can have on the brain and body. \nThe urge to fight or flee may overcome you \nFiring a gun can be startling. In response, first-timers can experience a fight-or-flight response - the body's way of automatically responding to what it perceives could be mortal danger. \nThe brain rapidly releases cortisol, adrenaline (aka epinephrine), and other hormones like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. This can lead novice shooters to feel intense fear, anxiety, or aggression after shooting. \n\"In order to pull that trigger, you're standing your ground, and you're going to use this weapon to help you. There is that 'fight' part of it,\" Fleming said. \"I know it's just a paper target, but some people are seeing that as the enemy. \u2026 Pulling the trigger is an act of aggression.\" \nEven experienced shooters have to manage their body's responses after firing thousands of rounds in countless training scenarios. \n\"The training is primarily designed to \u2026 bypass all of the emotional baggage of the experience,\" Fleming said. \"But I don't think it ever fully goes away.\" \nHeart rate, blood pressure, and breathing go up \nThe fight-or-flight response evolved to keep us alive in sticky situations, and spiking hormone levels also triggers a grab-bag of autonomic (i.e. uncontrollable) bodily reactions . \n\"It's based on our primate heritage,\" Fleming said. \"If you're going to run away from or fight something, you'd better start breathing faster to get enough oxygen in your blood, and pumping that oxygen around.\" \nAs a result, the heart begins to race, blood vessels constrict, and blood pressure skyrockets, in turn rapidly delivering oxygen and sugar to muscles. \nThe mind goes into overdrive \nAfter firing a gun, the brain also benefits from the rush of blood and fight-or-flight levels of neurochemicals. \nMental focus increases, and so does the ability to recognise patterns, while time seems to slow (though it doesn't actually do so) with the increased flow of information. \nPalms sweat and pupils dilate \n\"The sweaty palm helps you get a better grip,\" Fleming said, and wider-open eyes help you see more of your surroundings, especially in the dark. \nThe digestive system pauses \nThe body may also stop processing food. \n\"You can get sick to your stomach if you've have a big meal,\" Fleming said.

SIGNE DEAN 14 OCT 2017 \nEven though you use your brain to do a lot of thinking, you probably don't think about your brain that often. It's an incredibly complex , incredibly precious organ. It's also incredibly squishy, as you can see in an amazing teaching video that demonstrates a freshly removed brain straight from autopsy. \nAs the neuroanatomist handles the vulnerable blob with the utmost care, it's awe-inspiring to realise that each one of us has a squishy brain just like it - and it contains all our memories and thoughts. \nThe video , published on YouTube by the University of Utah Neuroscience Initiative back in 2013, is aimed at students who don't have access to 'fresh' brains such as this one, and have only preserved brains, models, and pictures as study aids. \n\"Students tend to think that the brain is sort-of the consistency of a rubber ball, and that's because in the laboratories, and teaching specimens, we have formalin-fixed brains ,\" says neuroanatomist Suzanne Stensaas in the video. \n\"However, if you're a trauma surgeon or a neurosurgeon, you realise that the brain is really very, very soft, and much more vulnerable than the impression you get when you're looking at the fixed brain.\" \nAs she's holding the 1.4 kg (3 lbs) brain in both palms, it's absolutely crazy to realise that right there is the entire set of life experiences of what was once a living, feeling human being. \n\"We are fortunate enough to show you what a normal, unfixed, recently deceased patient's brain would look like,\" says Stensaas. \nAs she explains, the cancer patient whose autopsy this brain is from, died from cell transplant complications. And seeing how Stensaas handles the specimen, we feel honoured to be able to learn so much thanks to the patient who donated their body to science. \nOur brains are usually protected by several membranes, cushioned by the cerebrospinal fluid and further encased within the hardy casing of the skull, so seeing it out in the open like that is a jarring reminder of how precious our brains really are. \nAnd that's actually one of the purposes of the video - apart from being a teaching material, the university wanted \"to stress the vulnerability of the brain to highlight the importance of wearing helmets, seat belts, and taking care of this very precious tissue.\" \nIndeed, after seeing this, it's difficult to put into words just how fragile the brain really is. \n\"It's much softer than most of the meat you would see in the market,\" Stensaas puts it in perspective as she's gently rotating the organ to show off the hemispheres and the wrinkly cerebellum . \nEven though she continues to rotate it, presumably to avoid holding it in one place for too long, she manages to leave a slight indentation of her finger on top of one of the hemispheres. \nAnd it turns out that even when a brain is preserved in a fixation solution, it can't be left sitting at the bottom of the tank as that will make it squat and out of shape - hence scientists loop a cord through one of the arteries to suspend the brain in the liquid (who knew!). \nYou can also see what looks like a piece of fabric stuck between the two hemispheres - that is actually the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes that protect the brain. \nAs Stensaas is pointing out the various anatomical features, we also get a clear glimpse of the brainstem, which looks shockingly thin, considering how many of our vital nerve impulses travel back and forth through that tiny bundle of nerves. \nJust incredible. \nWe've embedded the whole video below, and at this point it's probably pointless to warn you again that it is indeed quite graphic (but also amazing at the same time, so we do encourage you to watch it).

All rights reserved. optimarc/Shutterstock Researchers Just Shattered The Record For The Shortest-Ever Pulse of Light \nDon't blink. 14 OCT 2017 \nAt just 53 attoseconds, a single flash of an X-ray laser has become the shortest light pulse of its kind in the history of optics, smashing the previous record by 14 attoseconds. \nAs cool as it is, the record light pulse is more than just about bragging rights. The advance will improve research that requires measuring the positions and behaviours of particles within atoms and molecules in ways that could open doors to new kinds of technology. \nThe boundaries on ultrafast light pulses have been steadily narrowing since lasers were first developed in the 1960s. \nWe've come a long way since those first millisecond pulses, with the duration now measured in just a few dozen quintillionths of a second . \nResearchers from the University of Central Florida had also set the previous record of 67 attoseconds back in 2012 , only that time they'd used pulses of UV light. \nIn this latest experiment they've shortened the wavelength as well as the pulse, achieving the tiny blip of light with light in the more energetic X-ray part of the spectrum. \nFor some perspective on how quick this is, in a single second light can travel around the Earth 7.5 times. In 53 attoseconds, imagine light travelling only the distance of about a thousandth of the width of a human hair. \nBreaking light down into such short pulses has some serious physical applications. \n\"Such attosecond soft X-rays could be used to shoot slow-motion video of electrons and atoms of biological molecules in living cells to, for instance, improve the efficiency of solar panels by better understanding how photosynthesis works,\" says researcher Zenghu Chang . \nOn an atomic scale, certain measurements are made easier by relating them to common units. \nThe atomic unit for time is a ridiculously tiny 24 attoseconds, so having pulses that come close to that help improve resolution just as a faster camera allows us to record high-speed events like popping balloons or speeding bullets. \nPrevious records were accomplished using processes that limited the energy in the pulse to around 100 electron volts. \nSo the researchers tweaked the process to raise the amount of energy within the light pulse while still making the overall burst quite short. \nUltrashort pulses among the more energetic X-ray part of the spectrum, above 124 electron volts, have a distinct advantage. \nElectrons can only leap from their orbitals around the nucleus once they absorb specific quanta \u2013 or units \u2013 of light energy. \nOne way physicists describe the specific energy holding electrons in place comes from experiments done using X-rays. \nThis X-ray notation labels the orbitals with letters and numbers, with K1 as the first, then L1, L2, L3, M1, and so forth. \nHitting the K-edge for carbon is a milestone that allows researchers to target the electrons nearest the carbon atom's nucleus and watch the pinball-effects of electrons bouncing about. \n\"The photon energy of the attosecond X-ray pulses is two times higher than previous attosecond light sources and reached the carbon K-edge (284 eV), which makes it possible to probe and control core electron dynamics such as Auger processes ,\" says Chang . \nLight at K-edge energies also allows researchers to send pulses through what's known as the water window \u2013 the part of the spectrum where water is transparent to soft X-rays. \n\"This sets the stage for many new kinds of experiments, and pushes physics forward with the ability to understand matter better than ever before,\" says Rich Hammond from the US Army Research Office, who were responsible for funding the research. \nAdvancing technology means even the finest atomic processes need to be taken into account; understanding how electrons behave in a relatively complex atom like carbon potentially opens the way to squeezing more out of electronics and revealing the quantum underpinnings of biology. \nThis research was published in Nature Communications .

All rights reserved. Everett Collection/Shutterstock There's a Brain Quirk That Could Explain Why Some People Think They Are Psychic \nMagical thinking. 14 OCT 2017 \nThroughout history, there have been individuals who believe they've caught a sense of events yet to come. \nTrue clairvoyance is unsupported by scientific evidence, but a subtle difference in how some people perceive the timing of events could help explain why many remain convinced of their psychic abilities. \nA study by researchers from Yale University has provided some insight into why people think they have supernatural foresight, hinting at a physiological basis behind certain delusions. \nClairvoyance \u2013 or an ability to picture or predict future events with uncanny accuracy \u2013 has been held accountable to the scrutiny of scientists and skeptics since the 19th century. \nThe weight of evidence makes it fairly clear the human brain is not influenced by future events. \nIn many cases, proposed psychic abilities are the result of intentional fraud, with charlatans employing the same kinds of tricks mentalist magicians have used for centuries to feign mind reading and fortune telling. \nBut not all people who claim extraordinary abilities of future-sight are out to make a quick buck or two. Dismissing it as a sign of mental illness also tells us little about how such beliefs develop in otherwise healthy brains. \nTo gain an understanding of the neurological underpinnings of psychic prediction, the researchers made use of a test that had previously demonstrated a link between the timing of a colour changing shape, and the subject's judgement of their ability to predict its transformation. \nOnly this time the researchers also evaluated the volunteers' beliefs. \nJust over 1,000 volunteers were recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk program , which is a marketplace for tasks that require significant amounts of human brain power. \nEach was required to look at five empty squares at random locations on a screen and then predict which one would turn red. \nFollowing their guess, they had to record whether their prediction was correct, incorrect, or if they didn't have time to make a guess. \nThe researchers randomly adjusted the timing between the appearance of the squares and the colour change, meaning the volunteers sometimes needed to make a call in just a fraction of a second. \nA second test was also administered to control for the volunteer's ability to discriminate between the timing of tasks in front of them, one being the colour change, and another being a blinking screen. \nFollowing the task, the participants answered a questionnaire that measured how prone they were to delusional or magical thinking. \nStatistically speaking, each volunteer could expect to get one out of five predictions right. \nThe researchers found that as the period in which they needed to guess became shorter, a number of volunteers claimed to have become even better at guessing, reflecting similar results to the previous study. \nCritically, there was a relationship between the magical thinking test and the increased tendency to believe an accurate prediction had been made in a short period of time. \n\"We find that people who more often confuse the timing of their predictions with an observed outcome are more prone to report delusion-like thoughts and experiences,\" the researchers report in their study. \nIt seems as if the order of observation and prediction of an event is confused if the events occur close enough together. \n\"It's like thinking that you know it is about to rain, and then feeling the first drops,\" says researcher Adam Bear . \n\"Your thought may have been subconsciously influenced by those drops, yet you consciously experience them later.\" \nWhile this flip might not explain why some people feel they predicted an event hours or even years prior, it does hint at a solid neurological basis for giving some people increased confidence in their own clairvoyant powers. \nFuture research might help uncover the exact differences in brain wiring to explain how we combine observations and reasoning to develop evidence, or how sequences of events are 'compressed' in our conscious awareness. \nIf only psychic powers existed. Then we might already have those answers. \nThis research was published in PNAS .

Since then, gravitational waves have been detected three more times. \nThe most recent announcement was in September, when LIGO announced that its collaboration with interferometer Virgo had allowed a much more precise triangulation of the signal. \nPrior to that announcement, speculation was flying that the discovery was a collision between two neutron stars, with visuals from optical telescopes. \nThis time, we're hesitant to make any speculation, other than it seems big. Representatives from 70 other observatories around the world will be at the event, and simultaneous briefings will also be taking place in London and Munich. \nThere will be two separate panel discussions at the main event, too. The first panel consists of directors and spokespersons from LIGO, Virgo and NASA. \nThe second panel includes people like David Sand , Nial Tanvir , Eleonora Troja and Andy Howell , who have all performed research into supernovas, and Marcelle Soares-Santos , who is pioneering the Dark Energy Survey's search for an optical counterpart to gravitational wave events. \nWe're getting pretty excited, you guys.

All rights reserved. bogdan ionescu/Shutterstock A Nine-Year Collaboration Has Just Shown How Sugar Influences Cancer Cell Growth This is huge. 16 OCT 2017 There's a long-known relationship between cancer and sugar, but figuring out exactly how it works has proven elusive. Now, thanks to a nine-year research project, scientists have made a breakthrough. \nThey've narrowed down the mechanism whereby cancer cells metabolise sugar. \nThe focus of the new research was on a metabolic effect that has been understood for over 90 years . \nWe know that almost all the cells in the human body require energy, and they derive this energy from the sugars in the food we eat.

All rights reserved. Alessia Ranciaro Gene Variants That Affect Skin Colour Suggest The Concept of Race Is Deeply Flawed \nLet's rethink this. 16 OCT 2017 \nThroughout history, humans have used changes in skin colour to support the idea that people belong to different races, but a new study says it's beyond time to challenge that thinking. \nResearch into genetic variants associated with skin pigmentation in Africa helps to explain why African peoples embody a wide variety of different skin colours, and shows the factors that control our complexion are more complicated than concepts of race allow. \n\"One of the traits that most people would associate with race \u2013 skin colour \u2013 is a terrible classifier,\" geneticist Sarah Tishkoff from Penn University told The Atlantic . \n\"The study really discredits the idea of a biological construct of race. There are no discrete boundaries between groups that are consistent with biological markers.\" \nAlessia Ranciaro and Simon Thompson \nTishkoff's team recruited 1,570 African volunteers from ethnically and genetically diverse populations in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Botswana. \nThe researchers measured the light reflectance of the participants' skin, which indicates levels of the skin pigment melanin , and took a sample of their DNA. \nThe skin colour of the volunteers ranged greatly in colour, with the darkest being shown in Nilo-Saharan pastoralist populations in eastern Africa, and the lightest in San hunter-gatherer people in southern Africa. \n\"[W]ithin Africa there is a huge amount of variation,\" Tishkoff explains in a press release, \"ranging from skin as light as some Asians to the darkest skin on a global level and everything in between.\" \nWhen the team analysed the participants' DNA, they sifted through some 4 million sites in the volunteers' genomes looking for nucleotide variations that could create differences in skin colour. \nTishkoff Laboratory \nThey identified six key genes \u2013 known as SLC24A5, MFSD12, DDB1, TMEM138, OCA2, and HERC2 \u2013 featuring variants that are significantly associated with skin pigmentation, and which altogether are responsible for 29 percent of skin colour variations among people in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Botswana. \nBut these genes don't just affect the appearance of Africans. Previous research on pigmentation has identified some of the same markers being behind the generally lighter skins of Europeans and Asians. \nThe analysis also suggests most of the variants have been around for more than 300,000 years \u2013 and some are almost 1 million years old \u2013 meaning they long predated modern humans, and would have helped control pigmentation in our primitive ancestors. \nThe team's hypothesis is that some of the skin-lightening variants, including those around HERC2 and OCA2, may have arisen in Africa almost a million years ago, before being spread to Europe and Asia. \nIf they're right, that means our ancient ancestors might not have had dark skin, but lighter skin, before adapting to new conditions. \n\"If you were to shave a chimp, it has light pigmentation, so it makes sense that skin colour in the ancestors of modern humans could have been relatively light,\" says Tishkoff . \n\"It is likely that when we lost the hair covering our bodies and moved from forests to the open savannah, we needed darker skin.\" \nWhile this is the largest study looking at the genes behind African skin pigmentation to date, the researchers acknowledge there's still a lot we don't know about these variants, and some 70 percent of the biological markers affecting the colour of African skin are yet to be identified. \nBut even so, the researchers say their study shows there's more in our skin that unites us than divides us, so racist views and historically ill-informed conjecture about traits associated with the colour of skin aren't just immoral \u2013 they're scientifically wrong. \n\"[L]ight skin pigmentation, and likely other 'European' traits, are not unique to Europeans,\" biological statistician Jedidiah Carlson from the University of Michigan, who wasn't involved with the study, told The Atlantic . \n\"Human populations have been interbreeding for as long as we have existed as a species.\" \nThe findings are reported in Science .

SIGNE DEAN 16 OCT 2017 \nOkay, we know that the fidget spinner craze is pretty much over by now. But when you're living on the International Space Station, payloads can take a while to reach you. \nNow, astronauts on the ISS have finally got their hands on what was briefly the trendiest contraption in our part of the universe. And watching it spin in microgravity is enough to make the toy look cool again. \nNASA astronaut Randy Bresnik, who is currently aboard the space station as part of Expedition 52/53, shared a video over the weekend of him and his colleagues playing with a fidget spinner. \nThe team performs a series of tricks with the NASA-branded (of course) spinner, pretending to spin along with it in various directions as they float through the microgravity of the space station. \nFor example, flight engineer Mark T. Vande Hei holds the fidget spinner while he himself does full rotations along a horizontal plane; another crew member Joe Acaba does dizzying somersaults while the fidget spinner rotates in his hand. \nBut as fun and nauseating as that is to watch, the best part is, of course, seeing the fidget spinner freely floating through the air while continuing to spin. You can even see the iconic toy floating against a backdrop of Earth as seen through the ISS cupola windows . \nEven if you're sick and tired of fidget spinners, that's a pretty damn awesome thing to watch. \nAnd, as it turns out, microgravity does make a fidget spinner act differently than what we can achieve down on the ground. \nTypically, you hold onto the centre part of the spinner as you give it a whirl, and the whole thing works rotates so smoothly because of the tiny balls encased in two rings called 'races'. Depending on the model, there are also ball bearings on the prongs of the spinner, as you can see in the photo below: \nScienceAlert \n\"In a fidget spinner, you hold the centre of one ball bearing, the outer bearing race spins around, and the outer parts of the fidget spin with the outer bearing race,\" physicist Paul Doherty from the Exploratorium in San Francisco explained to Live Science earlier this year. \nThe smoother the action in that central bearing race, the less friction there is and the toy can spin for longer. But in space, the centre part doesn't stay still. \n\"Allowing the fidget spinner to float reduces the bearing friction by permitting the rate of the central ring and outer spinner to equalise, and the whole thing spins as a unit,\" NASA explains in the video description . \nIndeed, if you watch closely when Bresnik lets go of the spinner and lets it float around, you notice that the NASA logo stands still at first, but quickly starts rotating along with the rest of the device. \nNow, at first you might think that in space a fidget spinner would spin for much longer, but as it turns out, there's still plenty of friction happening in the central ball bearing to make the spin eventually slow down. \nBonus: If you're curious about what happens if you spin a fidget spinner in a vacuum chamber, check out this video from The Action Lab : \nBonus 2: Turns out all YouTube videos about fidget spinners have a fidget spinner loading icon and we only just noticed.

(We're in Australia, so it's already 16 October for us.) And from what we know so far guys, this gravitational wave discovery announcement is going to be massive. Like nothing we've seen before. \nWe're super-excited to share all the details with you as soon as the news drops, so stay tuned for a live blog and the big reveal ! \n12/10/17: Brace yourselves: it looks like there's another big gravitational wave announcement coming. \nLIGO and Virgo have announced that they're going to be holding a big press conference on Monday, 16 October at 10am EDT at the Press Club in Washington DC. \n\"The gathering will begin with an overview of new findings from LIGO, Virgo and partners that span the globe,\" the National Science Foundation announcement reads , \"followed by details from telescopes that work with the LIGO and Virgo collaborations to study extreme events in the cosmos.\" \nGravitational waves were officially confirmed publicly for the first time in February 2016, when LIGO announced that it had detected the phenomenon caused by a collision between two black holes. Since then, gravitational waves have been detected three more times. \nThe most recent announcement was in September, when LIGO announced that its collaboration with interferometer Virgo had allowed a much more precise triangulation of the signal. \nPrior to that announcement, speculation was flying that the discovery was a collision between two neutron stars, with visuals from optical telescopes. \nThis time, we're hesitant to make any speculation, other than it seems big.

SIGNE DEAN 16 OCT 2017 \nAs the unofficial world's most futuristic city, Dubai sure loves the attention it gets from employing cutting-edge tech such as 3D-printed buildings , hovertaxis , or this incredible Mars simulation city . \nNow Dubai's police force, already equipped with little autonomous robocops , is getting another leg up in the law enforcement race with incredibly cool, and somewhat dangerous-looking hoverbikes. \nThese airborne police officers will be using the Hoversurf Scorpion-3, a hoverbike prototype built by a Russian drone start-up and revealed earlier this year . \nThe electric-powered Scorpion-3 looks like a cross between a motorcycle and a quadcopter drone. Flying aloft on these, police officers in Dubai will be able to sound like a swarm of very angry bees as they fly across traffic to their next emergency. \nThe new technology to be employed by the city's police was revealed at Gitex 2017 , an international technology showcase currently happening at Dubai World Trade Centre. \nAs Saif Salem Al Kaabi from the Technical Innovation Section at Dubai Police explained to Gulf News , the hoverbike demonstrated at the showcase is still a prototype, and the police force has signed an agreement with the Hoversurf developers to produce a whole fleet. \nThe bikes will be programmed to fly at a maximum altitude of five metres (16.4 feet), and on one charge the electric motor can carry a person for 25 minutes at a maximum speed of 70 km/h (44 mph). \nAccording to a Facebook post by Hoversurf CEO Alexander Atamanov, these hoverbikes have actually set a world record at a 28.5 metre altitude (that's 93.5 feet). But as Al Kaabi explained to Gulf News, for safety reasons the officers will be constrained to travel at just five metres (16.3 feet), which seems fair enough. \nBefore letting these piloted quadcopters loose on the streets, Dubai police will first be doing more testing to decide on the best situations for their use. \nThe thinking is that hoverbikes could come in handy in areas where it's hard for the police to reach with regular vehicles, or in emergencies to fly above traffic congestions. \nIf you haven't seen one of these hoverbikes in action, Hoversurf have footage of the vehicle's first public flight at the Moscow raceway: \nAfter watching that we certainly feel like the future is, well, here.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "signe de", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "hoversurf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander atamanov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al kaabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saif salem al kaabi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gulf news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "technical innovation section", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoversurf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai world trade centre", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T09:25:38.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e78d58c4d34afb232eaaef9d00ac3005e808ec27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGkcN2euh1G5WEdNED6fuqAWY0CZ9igjP0Ry_Qog0907vNvKR.da2oceFYlnMye27uOc8UCqgPj5JzqVkkUbQA2awIr19TrMj_6SpHlrmAOJ7loFXpGQ.Ci.A2jKA30vTg", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Over 30,000 published studies could be wrong due to contaminated cells - ScienceAlert", "title_full": "Over 30,000 published studies could be wrong due to contaminated cells - ScienceAlert", "published": "2017-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.218, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/9325-cells-1_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 184, "comments": 0, "shares": 184}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 17}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e78d58c4d34afb232eaaef9d00ac3005e808ec27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGkcN2euh1G5WEdNED6fuqAWY0CZ9igjP0Ry_Qog0907vNvKR.da2oceFYlnMye27uOc8UCqgPj5JzqVkkUbQA2awIr19TrMj_6SpHlrmAOJ7loFXpGQ.Ci.A2jKA30vTg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Peter Dockrill", "published": "2017-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Over 30,000 published studies could be wrong due to contaminated cells - ScienceAlert", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. HeLa cells. Credit: NIH Over 30,000 Published Studies Could Be Wrong Due to Contaminated Cells \nThis is very, very bad. PETER DOCKRILL 16 OCT 2017 \nResearchers warn that large parts of biomedical science could be invalid due to a cascading history of flawed data in a systemic failure going back decades. \nA new investigation reveals more than 30,000 published scientific studies could be compromised by their use of misidentified cell lines, owing to so-called immortal cells contaminating other research cultures in the lab. \nThe problem is as serious as it is simple: researchers studying lung cancer publish a new paper, only it turns out the tissue they were actually using in the lab were liver cells. Or what they thought were human cells were mice cells, or vice versa , or something else entirely. \nIf you think that sounds bad, you're right, as it means the findings of each piece of affected research may be flawed, and could even be completely unreliable. \n\"Most scientists don't intentionally publish findings on the wrong cells,\" explains one of the researchers, Serge Horbach from Radboud University in the Netherlands. \n\"It's an honest mistake. The more concerning problem is that the research data is potentially invalid and impossible to reproduce.\" \nHorback and fellow researcher Willem Halffman wanted to know how extensive the phenomenon of misidentified cell lines really was, so they searched for evidence of what they call \"contaminated\" scientific literature. \nUsing the research database Web of Science , they looked for scientific articles based on any of the known misidentified cell lines as listed by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee's (ICLAC) Register of Misidentified Cell Lines . \nThere are currently 451 cell lines on this list, and they're not what you think they are \u2013 having been contaminated by other kinds of cells at some point in scientific history. Worse still, they've been unwittingly used in published laboratory research going as far back as the 1950s. \n\"After an extensive literary study, we believe this involves some 33,000 publications,\" Halffman explains . \n\"That means there are more than 30,000 scientific articles online that are reporting on the wrong cells.\" \nRadboud University \nOf the 451 cell lines known to be compromised, the most famous contaminating source is what's known as HeLa cells , named after their source, Henrietta Lacks . \nIn 1951, this 31-year-old mother of five from Virginia died from cervical cancer. But during treatment before her death, cells were taken from Lacks' cervix in a biopsy without her consent. \nLater, cell biologist George Otto Gey discovered these cells could be kept alive and grow indefinitely in a lab \u2013 as such, HeLa cells became the first immortalised cell line , meaning they didn't eventually die due to cellular senescence . \nThat everlasting quality made them a valuable research specimen that was distributed across the world, ultimately contributing to the development of cell cloning, the polio vaccine and many other firsts. \nIt's estimated as many as 20 tonnes of HeLa cells were ultimately grown, with the discovery featuring in a stunning 11,000 patents, but the cells' undying nature came with a hidden cost. \nNot only do the cells proliferate, they can also contaminate other exposed cell cultures in laboratory setting, and due to decades of use and misuse in the lab, HeLa cells and other contaminating and immortal cells have been estimated to have tainted up to 36 percent of cell lines scientists use in research. \n\"It's astonishingly easy for cell lines to become contaminated,\" ICLAC chair Amanda Capes-Davis explained in 2015 at Retraction Watch . \n\"When cells are first placed into culture, they usually pass through a period of time when there is little or no growth, before a cell line emerges. A single cell introduced from elsewhere during that time can outgrow the original culture without anyone being aware of the change in identity.\" \nOver decades, these cases of mistaken identity have in turn contaminated some 33,000 scientific papers by Horback and Halffman's count, and it's something that not enough in the research community know about. \n\"Employees at [biomedical cell distribution] centres recognise the problem, but claim no one will listen to them,\" says Halffman . \n\"Sometimes it involves semi-private companies that refuse to disclose anything for fear of reputation or financial damage. The biggest factor by far is pride and fear of reputation damage.\" \nAnother contributing issue is pressure to publish , with researchers not having the time or money to verify their cell cultures adequately before they begin their research. \nOf course, the tendency to skip that all-important verification is only something that worsens the broader reproducibility crisis plaguing science. \nThe researchers suggest published research using misidentified cell lines could be clarified with notices that highlight the issue, and say future publications need to implement systems that make the source of the cell lines investigated more transparent. \nWhatever course of action the research community decides upon, it's a huge problem to fix \u2013 but it's not something we can ignore. \n\"Nearly half a century after the first concerns about misidentified cell lines, the initiatives to improve authentication need to be complemented by attention to the already contaminated literature,\" the authors write . \n\"Our analysis shows that the task is sizeable and urgent.\" \nThe findings are reported in PLOS ONE .

Like nothing we've seen before. \nWe're super-excited to share all the details with you as soon as the news drops, so stay tuned for a live blog and the big reveal! \n12/10/17: Brace yourselves: it looks like there's another big gravitational wave announcement coming. \nLIGO and Virgo have announced that they're going to be holding a big press conference on Monday, 16 October at 10am EDT at the Press Club in Washington DC. \n\"The gathering will begin with an overview of new findings from LIGO, Virgo and partners that span the globe,\" the National Science Foundation announcement reads , \"followed by details from telescopes that work with the LIGO and Virgo collaborations to study extreme events in the cosmos.\" \nGravitational waves were officially confirmed publicly for the first time in February 2016, when LIGO announced that it had detected the phenomenon caused by a collision between two black holes. Since then, gravitational waves have been detected three more times. \nThe most recent announcement was in September, when LIGO announced that its collaboration with interferometer Virgo had allowed a much more precise triangulation of the signal. \nPrior to that announcement, speculation was flying that the discovery was a collision between two neutron stars, with visuals from optical telescopes. \nThis time, we're hesitant to make any speculation, other than it seems big.

LIGO/Virgo detections of gravitational waves were paired with a gamma ray burst, which led to the first-ever detection of a binary neutron star collision. Because it was detected so quickly, optical telescopes were able to point at the location of the collision - and capture images of it across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. For the first time, we have gravitational wave and electromagnetic wave detections of the same event! The electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves arrived at Earth at the same time - meaning that for the first time, we have confirmation that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Analysis of the electromagnetic data has confirmed for the first time ever that heavy elements such as gold, platinum and uranium originate in neutron star collisions. Finally, the combination of the gravitational waves and the redshift of host galaxy NGC 4993 could be combined to measure the age of the universe - and it was remarkably close to our current best estimates. A lot of questions were answered and mysteries solved, but the event raised new questions too - there's a lot more work for multi-messenger astronomy ahead! \nMake sure to check our in-depth article here to learn more about how it happened and about the massive implications this historical discovery has for physics and astronomy. \nYou can read our live blog coverage of the announcement below: \n9:30am EDT: It's 0:30am here in Sydney, Australia, so we're basically running on coffee and excitement. But it's always fun to stay awake for these announcements - and this one's going to be so worth it! \nThe big press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC is starting in 30 minutes. We'll embed a live stream link down below as it gets closer! \n9:31am EDT: While we wait for the announcement in less than half an hour, let's run a refresher course to entertain ourselves and prepare for the big news. \nGravitational waves are a lot like waves in water, or soundwaves in the air, except they're rippling across spacetime. When a massive event happens - like two black holes colliding - it's like dropping a stone into a puddle. \nRipples race out across the universe in all directions at the speed, theoretically at least, of light. \n9:35 EDT: In all our excitement we forgot to mention that you should keep refreshing this page to get the latest updates! (Also, sorry in advance for any egregious typos. We made popcorn to celebrate and it's getting in the keyboard.) \n9:37 EDT: Gravitational wave astronomy is still extremely fresh! We only got the first ever confirmation that gravitational waves exist last year, in February 2016 . \nIt was one of the biggest astrophysical discoveries in the previous hundred years, and may remain that way for another hundred. It's a huge deal - confirming predictions Einstein made in his theory of general relativity 100 years earlier in 1916. \n9:40 EDT: T minus 20 minutes! Hang on, we're getting the live stream link verrry shortly. \nMeanwhile, a bit more trivia: three of the scientists behind the discovery were just awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics earlier this month . Rainer Weiss of MIT and Barry C. Barish and Kip S. Thorne of CalTech represented over 1,000 scientists who participated in the discovery. \nToday, over 1,200 and around 100 institutions around the world participate in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. \n9:43 EDT: Let's talk more about the science! Here's how the gravitational wave detectors work: \nLIGO's detectors are known as Michelson interferometers. A laser beam is shone at a mirror down. This splits the beam. Part continues going forward; part splits off to the side. They're bounced off mirrors on the other side, and meet back in the middle, cancelling each other out. This meeting is called interference. \nIf the arms change length, as they do when a gravitational wave hits, one beam will take longer to travel back to the middle and the two beams won't cancel each other out. The resulting light continues on and is picked up by a photodetector. \nLIGO's interferometers are the largest in the world , with arms 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) long. \n9:45am EDT: The music just started on the livestream! We're embedding it at the bottom of this article so we can all watch together. \n9:50am EDT: 10 minutes to go! We're loving this jazz. \n9:52am EDT: This new gravitational wave astronomy has progressed amazingly fast, by the way. \nUntil earlier this year, only the two detectors were operational. This meant that scientists could only pinpoint gravitational wave events to a very broad swathe of sky. \nBut in August a third detector was added - Advanced Virgo. This allows triangulation. Gravitational waves don't hit every detector simultaneously. The order in which detections occur, and the length between them, lets scientists calculate the location with much more accuracy. \nIt was this third detector that showed a much smaller area for the fourth gravitational wave event . \n9:55am EDT: FIVE MINUTES! The music is getting more groovy! \n9:57am EDT: Okay, we're only a few minutes out, time to address some rumours . \nThat fourth gravitational wave event was a huge deal - but it wasn't what we were expecting . In August, University of Texas astrophysicist J. Craig Wheeler tweeted out that there was a new LIGO detection with optical counterpart. \nAs in, something we could actually see to go along with the gravitational wave detection. \nGreater accuracy is fantastic - but what did Wheeler mean? Did he get something wrong? Or was there another announcement to come\u2026? WILL OUR SOX GET BLOWN OFF? \n9:59am EDT: kay, we are hearing mike checks! Here is the speaker list for the first announcement: \nModerator:* France C\u00f3rdova, Director of the National Science FoundationPanelists:* David Reitze, Executive Director, LIGO Laboratory/Caltech* David Shoemaker, Spokesperson, LIGO Scientific Collaboration/MIT* Jo van den Brand, Spokesperson, Virgo Collaboration/Nikhef, VU University Amsterdam* Julie McEnery, Fermi Project Scientist, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center* Marica Branchesi, Virgo Collaboration/Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy* Vicky Kalogera, Astrophysicist, LIGO Scientific Collaboration/Northwestern University \n10:00am EDT: France C\u00f3rdova is on. Hold on to your hats, everyone. \n10:03am EDT: \"Today we are thrilled to announce that scientists have detected gravitational waves coming from the collision between two neutron stars.\" \n10:03am EDT: We detect a tremble in her voice. We are pretty emotional here ourselves over at ScienceAlert. \nScientists were also able to detect LIGHT! For the first time, we have gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves (light) from the SAME EVENT. \n\"Well, Dave, we did it again.\" \n10:03am EDT: Read more about this discovery right here. \n10:05 am EDT: David Reitze: \"We have for the first time seen gravitational waves and light from the collision between two dense, dense stars.\" \nLIGO and Advanced Virgo detected the signal at around the same time, and determined it was from neutron stars 130 million light-years away - that's 130 million years ago. \nBut the most amazing thing? The emission of light. Seven space-based observatories and every continent on the planet turned telescopes to capture it. \n10:07am EDT: LIGO just tweeted this map of detections: \u2014 LIGO (@LIGO) October 16, 2017 \n10:09am EDT: Astronomers have thought for a long time that heavy elements such as platinum, gold and uranium are created in the collisions between neutron stars. \nNow, we have actual concrete evidence of that. So the gold on Earth probably came from neutron star collisions, Reitze says. Even the gold in his grandfather's pocket watch. Awww. \n10:10am EDT: David Shoemaker is now telling us about how gravitational waves are measured. The distance the arms move is less than the width of a human hair - that's how sensitive this equipment is. \nThe length of the inteferometers' arms boosts the signal over distance so that it can be detected. If you're interested in how this works, you should watch this section of the livestream, it's really fascinating. \nWe've explained it a little above, but Shoemaker is the expert (obviously). \n10:15am EDT: \"We shared in the joy and excitement of that moment.\" WE ARE FEELING IT NOW. \nThe \"chirp\" signal from the neutron star collision (GW170817) was longer than the chirps from black holes because they're much lighter. \nAlso, at the same time as the gravitational wave signal came through, a gamma ray burst - caused only by the universe's most violent events - came from the same region of the sky! \nThat's how the team knew they were onto something different. \n10:17am EDT: Jo van den Brand from the Virgo Collaboration has taken the podium. The gravitational wave signal arrived at Virgo in Italy first, then LIGO's two detectors, a few seconds apart. \nThis is how they figured out where to look for GW170817, in the constellation of Hydra, near galaxy NGC 4993. \nThe illustration in this tweet shows how they detected it: First detection of a neutron star fusion by @ligo and @ego_virgo . https://t.co/zLMNSmrsIM Source seen by tens of telescopes worldwide pic.twitter.com/JGyT7yddNU \n\"It's the start of a beautiful new field in science.\" \n10:23am EDT: Ooooh we're getting into the gamma ray burst part! \n10:22am EDT: Julie McEnery works on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Telescope that made the first detections of those gamma ray bursts (along with the ESO's INTEgral gamma-ray burst telescope) that coincided with the gravitational wave detection. \nInitially, she said, they didn't think anything of it - until half an hour later, when an email came in, alerting the Fermi team to LIGO-Virgo's detection. \n\"With these observations, we're not just learning what happens when two neutron stars collide. We're also learning something fundamental about the nature of the universe.\" \n10:27am EDT: Here's why you might hear Albert Einstein mentioned in connection with this new discovery. In 1915 he predicted that the speed of gravitational waves would be the same as the speed of light. \nAnd because the gamma rays and the gravitational rays arrived at the same time, it confirms that gravitational waves do indeed move at the speed of light. \nIn other words, Einstein nailed it. \n10:28am EDT: Marica Branchesi is showing us what happened in the days following the gamma ray detection. \nThe electromagnetic emissions changed from very bright gamma rays, to X-rays, to ultraviolet, to infrared, to radio waves. You can actually see that in this timelapse . \n10:31am EDT: WOW, take a look at this: Artist's conception of the #GoldenBinary which produced #GravityAndLight and heavy elements like gold! pic.twitter.com/gwhbJvqxeV \u2014 LIGO (@LIGO) October 16, 2017 \n10:32am EDT: LIGO's Vicky Kalogera is here to explain to us the history of these two neutron stars. She says that neutron stars act a bit like lighthouses, with their polar jets pulsing as they rotate. \nThis has led to them being mistaken for pulsars - the first binary neutron star wasn't discovered until 1974. \nThese stars are very far apart - over five times the distance between the Earth and the moon - and will not merge for another 300 million years. \n10:36am EDT: The two neutron stars in GW170817 lived a very long and happy life, but their orbit inside their galaxy changed when the second star collapsed into a neutron star. \nKalogera describes it as taking a holiday in their twilight years - that's rather poetic and makes us happy. \n\"We've solved a lot of mysteries, but at the same time, we've opened up a lot of questions. We're hoping that future observations .. are going to answer a lot of those questions.\" \n10:38am EDT: The future of gravitational wave astronomy is looking \"golden bright\", thank you for that pun. \n10:42am EDT: Okay guys, this announcement is wrapping up now and we're in the Q&A phase, so we're just doing a quick recap now to wrap up this live blog as well. \n10:50am EDT: If you're keen to keep watching, there will be a second panel at 11:15am starring several supernova experts, diving deeper into the incredible science we're learning from this discovery. \n10:58am EDT: And that's all from us tonight! Thanks so much to everyone who tuned in! We'll be buzzing for days and yes, it was absolutely worth staying up so late for this - after all, such historical moments don't come around that often. \nThe livestream from the event is here:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "einstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry c. barish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle starr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "signe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainer weiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kip s. thorne", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "caltech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ligo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national press club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ligo scientific collaboration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T16:49:08.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6470f51b49141f3c70126ff6c41ae932bcf590e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGLNrrlE6eMgl25pM_TqnixbknujzLeIYPwr7vsvPUy0Mmw76aNuRuuAWlQD0NF..KLu4csoi61WKlc4l2D_s0KKSi3zf35MczEzfCgvSjrwU-", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "IT'S OFFICIAL: Gravitational Waves Have Given Us Colliding Neutron Stars!", "title_full": "IT'S OFFICIAL: Gravitational Waves Have Given Us Colliding Neutron Stars!", "published": "2017-10-16T13:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/gravitational-waves-neutron-stars-first-time-ever-artist-impression_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2588, "comments": 0, "shares": 2588}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 1}}}, "uuid": "a6470f51b49141f3c70126ff6c41ae932bcf590e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGLNrrlE6eMgl25pM_TqnixbknujzLeIYPwr7vsvPUy0Mmw76aNuRuuAWlQD0NF..KLu4csoi61WKlc4l2D_s0KKSi3zf35MczEzfCgvSjrwU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michelle Starr", "published": "2017-10-16T13:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "IT'S OFFICIAL: Gravitational Waves Have Given Us Colliding Neutron Stars!", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. ESO/L. Cal\u00e7ada/M. Kornmesser IT'S OFFICIAL: Gravitational Waves Have Given Us Colliding Neutron Stars! \nSCIENCE IS SO AMAZING. 16 OCT 2017 For the first time ever, scientists around the world have managed to photograph a collision between two neutron stars, 130 million light-years away. The event is named GW170817. \nAnd it's all thanks to gravitational wave astronomy, which identified the event and alerted observatories on where to look. So add to that list of firsts the first simultaneous optical and gravitational wave observations of the same event. \nCan we have a party? Let's have a party. \nSeriously, though, this is amazing. Never before have we been able to pinpoint where gravitational waves are coming from, or observe the event that caused them. And it's only the fifth gravitational detection ever. \nThe previous four detections were from collisions (or mergers) between binary black holes, coming together to form one big black hole. There were two main reasons we couldn't see them. \nThe first was that, until earlier this year, we only had two detectors \u2013 LIGO's interferometers in Livingston, Louisiana and Hanford, Washington. This meant that the first three events could be pinpointed only to a very broad area of sky. \nThe addition of a third detector, Virgo's interferometer in Italy, improved location accuracy by a factor of about 10, in the announcement of the fourth gravitational wave event just a few weeks ago . \nThe second was that black holes, by their very nature, are invisible. They absorb all light \u2013 we can only infer their existence based on changes in space around them. Neutron stars, on the other hand, are very visible, so a collision between them was a hotly anticipated event. \nTo make this new set of observations, around 70 ground- and space-based observatories joined LIGO and Virgo in examining a small area of the sky in the constellation of Hydra, right next to the lenticular galaxy NGC 4993. \nThe first detector went off on 17 August at 8.41am EDT. \nThen, around 1.7 seconds later, two space-based observatories, NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and ESA's INTErnational Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, picked up an intense gamma-ray burst \u2013 the brightest and most energetic events in the universe \u2013 from the same area of sky. \nThe \"chirp\" was different, too. These are the waves converted into audio data, and for black hole collisions, they last just fractions of a second . In GW170817, the chirp lasted around 100 seconds . \nIt wasn't a coincidence, and astronomers around the world made a mad dash to point their telescopes at Hydra. \n\"It immediately appeared to us the source was likely to be neutron stars, the other coveted source we were hoping to see - and promising the world we would see,\" LIGO spokesperson David Shoemaker said. \nNeutron stars are one of the things that can happen at the end of the life-cycle of a supermassive star. \nThe core collapses, squeezing the protons and electrons into neutrons and neutrinos. The neutrinos escape, but the neutrons are incredibly densely packed into a core between just 10 and 20 kilometres (6-12 miles) in diameter. \nIf this core is less than about three stellar masses, the pressure of this density supports the neutron star. If the core is any larger, it collapses into a black hole. \nThe two neutron stars involved in GW170817 were between around 1.1 and 1.6 stellar masses, and they orbited each other in a shrinking spiral from a distance of about 300 kilometres, warping spacetime around them as they gathered speed, and sending ripples across the universe. \nFor the distance we're observing them from, the final collision was extremely bright, emitting an intense \"fireball\" of gamma rays. You can see it in the video below. Watch this. The big bright spot in the centre is galaxy NGC 4993. Just above and to the left, you can see GW170817. \nIsn't that absolutely incredible? That is a collision between two neutron stars not much larger than the sun, 130 million light-years away, and you are seeing it with your own eyes. \nBut it gets even better. Remember we mentioned a gamma-ray burst? \n\"For decades we've suspected short gamma-ray bursts were powered by neutron star mergers,\" said Fermi Project Scientist Julie McEnery of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \n\"Now, with the incredible data from LIGO and Virgo for this event, we have the answer. The gravitational waves tell us that the merging objects had masses consistent with neutron stars, and the flash of gamma rays tells us that the objects are unlikely to be black holes, since a collision of black holes is not expected to give off light.\" \nAnd they also, once again, proved Einstein right. \n\"It \u2026 demonstrated that the speed of gravitational waves was the same as light to just a few parts in 10,000 trillion \u2013 verifying a central prediction of Einstein dating back to 1915,\" said Andrew Melatos of the University of Melbourne. \nIn the weeks and months ahead, observatories will continue to take observations of the collision to find out more about the kilonova. This is when the material that is left over from the collision, still glowing brightly, continues to be blown out into space. \nObservatories and institutions around the world will also be releasing papers about this event. There are just so many aspects of it to be explored. \n\"From informing detailed models of the inner workings of neutron stars and the emissions they produce, to more fundamental physics such as general relativity, this event is just so rich,\" Shoemaker said. \n\"It is a gift that will keep on giving.\" \nFind out more in the Veritasium video below: \nThe LIGO-Virgo results have been published in the journal Physical Review Letters .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "m. kornmesser", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "einstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david shoemaker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew melatos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virgo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie mcenery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shoemaker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "esa's international gamma ray astrophysics laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "physical review letters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ligo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goddard space flight center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hanford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "livingston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virgo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hydra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T17:21:00.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14be4cf02506d621ff47ea5a322769b00a8cb295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGmLT9Ju1lw5NSUp1qMZx7xReGLL_kJR.210weWjOelEI_uEwJWjb51Df8pXk9KFmkNkivgFFFF_S4WkyXvAPI0uyEVwmxjQgNqj0rYgrX6o8Kbc9Hyh8TSA--", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "Here's The Horrifying Reason Why Scientists See So Few Baby Chimps Born in The Wild", "title_full": "Here's The Horrifying Reason Why Scientists See So Few Baby Chimps Born in The Wild", "published": "2017-10-17T09:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/ChimpMumBaby2_web_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1223, "comments": 0, "shares": 1223}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "14be4cf02506d621ff47ea5a322769b00a8cb295", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGmLT9Ju1lw5NSUp1qMZx7xReGLL_kJR.210weWjOelEI_uEwJWjb51Df8pXk9KFmkNkivgFFFF_S4WkyXvAPI0uyEVwmxjQgNqj0rYgrX6o8Kbc9Hyh8TSA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Signe Dean", "published": "2017-10-17T09:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here's The Horrifying Reason Why Scientists See So Few Baby Chimps Born in The Wild", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. Sergey Uryadnikov/Shutterstock Here's The Horrifying Reason Why Scientists See So Few Baby Chimps Born in The Wild One grizzly incident might explain a lot. SIGNE DEAN 17 OCT 2017 When chimpanzee mothers are about to have a baby, they tend to travel away from their group for a while and lie low in a safe, secret place to give birth. After witnessing a harrowing case in which a male chimp snatched away an infant seconds after its birth and cannibalised it, researchers think that chimp mothers might be hiding away to prevent the deaths of their newborn babies. Researchers Hitonaru Nishie and Michio Nakamura from Kyoto University recently reported on the first-ever observed case when a wild chimpanzee baby is grabbed and eaten by an adult male of the same group. While that sounds absolutely horrifying, the gruesome details of the case have actually helped scientists shed new light on the parenting behaviours and sexual competition of wild chimpanzees. It's extremely rare for scientists to catch a glimpse of a wild chimp mum giving birth, and primatologists know that expecting mums tend to isolate themselves from their group. So the team was quite surprised when one rainy December morning in 2014, one of the females in the group they'd been observing suddenly gave birth while hanging out with a party of 20 other chimps. The female, named Devota, had been a part of this group for two years at that point; the scientists hadn't even noticed any warning signs that she was expecting, and saw none of the tell-tale signs that she was about to give birth. Unfortunately, the situation quickly turned from surprise to shock, as a dominant male named Darwin immediately snatched the newborn from the ground and rushed away before Devota could even touch it. \"The entire incident occurred very rapidly; therefore, we could not confirm whether a live-birth or stillbirth had occurred or even the sex of the infant,\" the team writes in their study . It only got worse from there. Half an hour later Darwin emerged from the bushes, holding the infant. Working in rainy and badly lit conditions, Nishie managed to snap a few photos, before the male rushed off again. Nishie & Nakamura, Am J Phys Anthropol (2017) When the researchers located him in a nearby tree some 15 minutes later, the male had already started eating the infant's body, starting from the legs. Over the next hour, the team saw a few other chimps picking up and eating bits that had fallen on the ground under the tree, and soon enough Darwin was done with his grisly meal. \"On December 3, the following day, we located Darwin at 11:30am and followed him throughout the day. As Darwin had severe diarrhoea, we could not locate any bones or hairs of the infant in his faeces,\" the researchers write . So maybe his stomach didn't agree that well with the eating of one of his kin. The team witnessed these events while they were studying a large group of chimps living in the Mahale mountains near Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania. Labelled simply as the 'M group', this band of chimps has been continuously studied by different researchers since 1968. You won't be cheered up by the fact that primate males in many species readily kill unrelated infants. This is due to competition - killing an infant that's not their own means the female will be ready sooner for another mating attempt, heightening the male's chances to sire offspring with her. But while both 'infanticide' and cannibalism in chimps has been documented before, this is the first time scientists have seen a baby snatched immediately after delivery. \"We argue that the rarity of similar observations to this case is largely because of the rare chance to observe delivery among wild chimpanzees,\" the team writes . They hypothesise that this case shows why chimp mums go on their secret maternity leave - to protect their newborns from murders that might be much more common than we know. Why did Devota give birth so suddenly? The team thinks it's possible that as a first time mum she hadn't yet learned the strategy for going away, or maybe the infant's father was actually nearby so she didn't perceive the danger. But before you get too sad about this story, the M group in Mahale is not just a bunch of murderous monsters. Just last year, Nakamura and his team also reported they'd witnessed the group looking after a disabled baby chimp . \nWe're sure our primate cousins will continue to surprise us in the future, too. \nThe study was published in The American Journal of Physical Anthropology . \nUpdate 17 October 2017: An earlier version of this article feature an image of baboons.

Therefore, any correct implementation of WPA2 is likely affected.\" \nBy taking advantage of the vulnerability in what is called a key reinstallation attack (KRACK), a hacker could read information supposed to be encrypted on a Wi-Fi network, intercepting potentially sensitive information like credit card numbers, passwords, photos, and messages. \nIn the worst case, Vanhoef says, it could be possible for someone to use KRACKs to inject and manipulate data on a compromised Wi-Fi network, hijacking devices to inject ransomware or other malware onto systems. \n\"Wow. Everyone needs to be afraid,\" researcher Robert Graham of Errata Security, who wasn't involved with the discovery, wrote in a blog post . \n\"It means in practice, attackers can decrypt a lot of Wi-Fi traffic, with varying levels of difficulty depending on your precise network setup.\" \nThe good news in all this is that the hack can't be executed online: any attacker trying to take advantage of the flaw needs to do so locally, to be within range of the wireless network they're trying to breach. \nThat's because the attack works by fooling a security layer in WPA2 called the four-way handshake , which determines whether devices seeking to join a Wi-Fi network have the right credentials. \nWhen this happens, the handshake is supposed to generate a fresh encryption key to encrypt all subsequent traffic, but KRACKs manage to fool the network into reusing a previously issued encryption key. \n\"Essentially, to guarantee security, a key should only be installed and used once,\" Vanhoef explains . \n\"Unfortunately, we found this is not guaranteed by the WPA2 protocol. By manipulating cryptographic handshakes, we can abuse this weakness in practice.\" \nIn the researchers' testing, the attack worked with varying levels of success against client devices running Apple, Windows, Android, and many other operating systems on compromised networks, and while websites and apps using HTTPS encryption were harder to breach, they weren't always fool-proof. \nFortunately, the code that makes this attack possible hasn't been publicly released \u2013 so it's unlikely we'll see a wave of hackers taking advantage of it straight away, because first they'd need to reverse-engineer how it works. \nBefore that happens, technology companies \u2013 who were given fore-warning of the vulnerability \u2013 are already busy patching their systems, and some of these patches are already available , which Vanhoef says we should all grab as soon as possible. \n\"Changing the password of your Wi-Fi network does not prevent (or mitigate) the attack,\" he explains in an FAQ about the new attack vector. \n\"Instead, you should make sure all your devices are updated, and you should also update the firmware of your router.\" \nOf great ongoing concern are the many 'Internet of Things' (IoT) devices and appliances now in use that are difficult to update or go unsupported by their manufacturers. These include things like Wi-Fi enabled home security cameras and televisions. \nThe vulnerability is detailed in a research paper available online, which is due to be presented at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Dallas in November.

All rights reserved. China Manned Space Engineering China's First Space Station Will Come Crashing Down to Earth Within Months \nIt's out of control and declining fast. MICHELLE STARR 17 OCT 2017 \nThe 8.5-tonne (9.4-ton) Chinese space station Tiangong-1 has accelerated its descent towards Earth, and is expected to come crashing down to the surface within the next few months. \nWhile most of the 12-metre (40-foot) laboratory will probably burn up in the atmosphere on reentry, chunks weighing up to 100 kilograms (220 pounds) could make it to Earth - and no one can predict where they're going to end up. \nThe space station was launched in 2011, and hosted three missions, including China's first female astronauts, Liu Yang and Wang Yaping. The station's name means \"Heavenly Palace\", and it was used as a technological testbed for a larger space station planned for 2023 . \nIt was never intended to be permanent, and in March 2016, the Chinese government announced that its time had come to an end . But then in September 2016, Chinese officials confirmed that they had lost control of the station , and it was on a decaying orbit. \nThey predicted that it would fall to Earth sometime between October 2017 and April 2018, noting that its altitude was about 370 kilometres (230 miles). The K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which represents the official border between Earth and space, is at 100 kilometres (62 miles). \nNow, according to Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, it's a lot closer, and is likely to fall to Earth sooner than later. \n\"Now that [its] perigee is below 300 kilometres (186 miles) and it is in denser atmosphere, the rate of decay is getting higher,\" he told The Guardian . \"I expect it will come down a few months from now - late 2017 or early 2018.\" \nWhen and where is unknown, but it is unlikely to pose a serious danger. In 1991, Russian space station Salyut 7 reentered Earth's atmosphere over Argentina , causing a spectacular lightshow, and little to no debris. \nIn 2001, Russian space station Mir was brought home via controlled reentry. Debris fell, but mainly over the Pacific Ocean. \nAnd, of course, NASA's Skylab reentered Earth's atmosphere over Western Australia in 1979. Australia issued NASA a fine for littering for that one. \nNo deaths or injuries were ever reported from these events. If you're lucky, though, you may just get to see the fireworks as the space station comes apart and the friction from reentry incinerates it.

DAVID NIELD 16 OCT 2017 \nScientists have successfully pumped molten metal in a custom-made machine at a temperature of 1,400\u00b0C (2,552\u00b0F), a leap forward that could be used to upgrade the capabilities of solar thermal plants across the world. \nUsually, shifting liquid metal at anything much above 1,000\u00b0C (1,832\u00b0F) causes the material it's held in to break under the heat, thus limiting the amount of energy we can store as heat in facilities like the Crescent Dunes plant near Las Vegas. \nTo get around this limitation, the team from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Stanford, and Purdue University in Indiana, engineered a special kind of ceramic that could accommodate the expansion and contraction that comes along with the intense heat. The pump was then sealed with graphite and filled with nitrogen. \nAlong with the materials advances, the pump is also designed so that the gear teeth and motor are deliberately misaligned \u2013 the expansion that follows its exposure to extreme heat then aligns them properly to do the job at the heat levels we've never achieved before. \nThe pump in action.

All rights reserved. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Alligators Have Been Caught Feasting on Sharks in a Bizarre Predator Cross Over \nIt's on. 17 OCT 2017 \nFor the first time, researchers have documented the violent clash of predators from two very different worlds, discovering evidence of alligators feasting on sharks in the wild. \nWhile there have been anecdotal reports of this kind of thing happening before, it's never been comprehensively studied, since ordinarily the American alligator ( Alligator mississippiensis ) and sharks occupy very different bodies of water. \nBut that's not always the case. In coastal areas where marine ecosystems meet with estuaries, sometimes sharks and stingrays will veer from their ocean habitat into the briny mix of fresh and saltwater near the shore. \nEvidently, it's not always a good idea to do this, because it can bring them into contact with a fearsome predator that can adapt to the salty conditions of these coastal waterways. \nJudy Cooke \n\"Alligators seek out fresh water in high-salinity environments,\" says ecologist James Nifong from Kansas State University. \n\"When it rains really hard, they can actually sip fresh water off the surface of the saltwater. That can prolong the time they can stay in a saltwater environment.\" \nFor their research, Nifong and wildlife biologist Russell Lowers searched through scientific and historical literature and consulted experts for any accounts of alligators attacking elasmobranchii \u2013 a subclass of cartilaginous fish that includes sharks and rays. \nThey found unreported evidence of four times where American alligators preyed on elasmobranchii, including attacks on a nurse shark (image at top), bonnethead shark (image above and below), lemon shark, and an Atlantic stingray. \nThere might not be any great whites on that list, but it shows A. mississippiensis is happy to forage beyond its regular diet of crustaceans, snails, and fish when seafood specials feature on the menu. \nJudy Cooke \n\"Alligators are opportunistic,\" Nifong explained to New Scientist . \"They're not going to pass up a big chunk of protein that's swimming by.\" \nWhile the known instances of this preying are few and far between, the researchers say the fact it happens at all means sharks and rays may constitute a more significant part of the alligator diet than scientists had previously realised. \nIt's also food for thought when it comes to managing endangered marine animals \u2013 as one of the uncontemplated risks to their survival could be death by alligator. \nAs for why this preying behaviour has gone mostly unnoticed for so long, it could be because both alligators and sharks are difficult animals to study and observe in coastal habitats \u2013 especially since some small sharks can be mistaken for fish. \nThere's also the question of post-meal evidence \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 when researchers pump alligator guts to analyse what they've been consuming. \n\"Most prey gators eat turn to mush pretty quickly within their stomachs,\" ecologist Adam Rosenblatt from the University of North Florida, who wasn't involved with the study, told National Geographic . \n\"It all turns into one big pile of indistinguishable stuff, except for certain body parts like hair and shells.\" \nBut just in case you thought this was a one-way contest, guess again. In the course of their research, Nifong and Lowers also uncovered reports of a bizarre historical melee, when the tables were turned on alligators. \n\"[O]n 5 October 1877 the sports magazine The Fishing Gazette published an article entitled 'Alligator and Shark Fight', recounting the observations of an epic skirmish between American alligators and sharks (unknown species) in a tidal inlet near Jupiter, Florida,\" the authors write in their paper . \nAccording to The Fishing Gazette , after some 500 alligators congregated in the inlet to feast on a school of fish brought in by the tide, hundreds of sharks responding to the bloodbath zeroed in for an alligator ambush. \nPer one eyewitness account: \"[The] sharks and alligators rise on the crest of the waves and fight like dogs.\" \nEpic. \nThe findings are reported in Southeastern Naturalist .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cau", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "judy cooke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lowers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell lowers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam rosenblatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nifong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james nifong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "the fishing gazette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national geographic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of north florida", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jupiter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T14:20:34.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "528b0b6cbded193573d20233453100e843b358c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGTJNo5TjHzD5e8KqOHDWzjPQ238M.lxH7uNX64OySzcwTPy8ogLY_a3vAzHOC5UA5Nvzj335R7zibGTjzrHudRQVtAb4BFbMlj4inz5Ujnt0.GQzw77Dj3l2BVaY1.l8s", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "The weather on Jupiter's moon Titan is even more extreme and Earth-like than we thought - ScienceAlert", "title_full": "The weather on Jupiter's moon Titan is even more extreme and Earth-like than we thought - ScienceAlert", "published": "2017-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.03, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/titan_web_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 20, "comments": 0, "shares": 907}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "528b0b6cbded193573d20233453100e843b358c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGTJNo5TjHzD5e8KqOHDWzjPQ238M.lxH7uNX64OySzcwTPy8ogLY_a3vAzHOC5UA5Nvzj335R7zibGTjzrHudRQVtAb4BFbMlj4inz5Ujnt0.GQzw77Dj3l2BVaY1.l8s", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Williams", "published": "2017-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The weather on Jupiter's moon Titan is even more extreme and Earth-like than we thought - ScienceAlert", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute The Weather on Jupiter's Moon Titan Is Even More Extreme And Earth-Like Than We Thought \nMethane hurricanes? 17 OCT 2017 \nSaturn's largest moon, Titan , is a mysterious place; and the more we learn about it, the more surprises it seems to have in store. \nAside from being the only body beyond Earth that has a dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere, it also has methane lakes on its surface and methane clouds in its atmosphere. This hydrological-cycle, where methane is converted from a liquid to a gas and back again, is very similar to the water cycle here on Earth. \nThanks to the NASA/ESA Cassini-Huygens mission , which concluded on September 15th when the craft crashed into Saturn's atmosphere, we have learned a great deal about this moon in recent years. \nThe latest find , which was made by a team of UCLA planetary scientists and geologists, has to do with Titan's methane rain storms. Despite being a rare occurrence, these rainstorms can apparently become rather extreme. \nThe study which details their findings, titled \" Regional Patterns of Extreme Precipitation on Titan Consistent with Observed Alluvial Fan Distribution \", recently appeared in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience . \nLed by Saun P. Faulk, a graduate student at UCLA's Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences , the team conducted simulations of Titan's rainfall to determine how extreme weather events have shaped the moon's surface. \nNASA/JPL/Space Science Institute \nWhat they found was that the extreme methane rainstorms may imprint the moon's icy surface in much the same way that extreme rainstorms shape Earth's rocky surface. \nOn Earth, intense rainstorms play an important role in geological evolution. When rainfall is heavy enough, storms can trigger large flows of water that transport sediment into low lands, where it forms cone-shaped features known as alluvial fans. \nDuring it's mission, the Cassini orbiter found evidence of similar features on Titan using its radar instrument, which suggested that Titan's surface could be affected by intense rainfall. \nWhile these fans are a new discovery, scientists have been studying the surface of Titan ever since Cassini first reached the Saturn system in 2006. In that time, they have noted several interesting features. \nThese included the vast sand dunes that dominate Titan's lower latitudes and the methane lakes and seas that dominate it's higher latitudes \u2013 particularly around the northern polar region. \nThe seas \u2013 Kraken Mare, Ligeia Mare, and Punga Mare \u2013 measure hundreds of km across and up to several hundred metres deep, and are fed by branching, river-like channels. There are also many smaller, shallower lakes that have rounded edges and steep walls, and are generally found in flat areas. \nIn this case, the UCLA scientists found that the alluvial fans are predominantly located between 50 and 80 degrees latitude. This puts them close to the center of the northern and southern hemispheres, though slightly closer to the poles than the equator. \nTo test how Titan's own rainstorms could cause these features, the UCLA team relied on computer simulations of Titan's hydrological cycle. \nNASA \nWhat they found was that while rain mostly accumulates near the poles \u2013 where Titan's major lakes and seas are located \u2013 the most intense rainstorms occur near 60 degrees latitude. \nThis corresponds to the region where alluvial fans are most heavily concentrated, and indicates that when Titan does experience rainfall, it is quite extreme \u2013 like a seasonal monsoon-like downpour. \nAs Jonathan Mitchell \u2013 a UCLA associate professor of planetary science and a senior author of the study \u2013 indicated, this is not dissimilar to some extreme weather events that were recently experienced here on Earth. \n\"The most intense methane storms in our climate model dump at least a foot of rain a day, which comes close to what we saw in Houston from Hurricane Harvey this summer,\" he said. \nThe team also found that on Titan, methane rainstorms are rather rare, occurring less than once per Titan year \u2013 which works out to 29 and a half Earth years. But according to Mitchell, who is also the principal investigator of UCLA's Titan climate modeling research group, this is more often than they were expecting. \"I would have thought these would be once-a-millennium events, if even that,\" he said. \"So this is quite a surprise.\" \nIn the past, climate models of Titan have suggested that liquid methane generally concentrates closer to the poles. But no previous study has investigated how precipitation might cause sediment transport and erosion, or shown how this would account for various features observed on the surface. As a result, this study also suggests that regional variations in surface features could be caused by regional variations in precipitation. \nOn top of that, this study is an indication that Earth and Titan have even more in common than previously thought. On Earth, contrasts in temperature are what lead to intense seasonal weather events. \nIn North America, tornadoes occur during the early to late Spring, while blizzards occur during the winter. Meanwhile, temperature variations in the Atlantic ocean are what lead to hurricanes forming between the summer and fall. \nSimilarly, it appears that on Titan, serious variations in temperature and moisture are what triggers extreme weather. When cooler, wetter air from the higher latitudes interacts with warmer, drier air from the lower latitudes, intense rainstorms result. \nThese findings are also significant when it comes to other bodies in our Solar System that have alluvial fans on them \u2013 such as Mars. \nIn the end, understanding the relationship between precipitation and planetary surfaces could lead to new insights about the impact climate change has on Earth and the other planets. \nSuch knowledge would also go a long way towards helping us mitigate the effects it is having here on Earth, where the changes are only unnatural, but also sudden and very hazardous. \nAnd who knows? Someday, it could even help us to alter the environments on other planets and bodies, thus making them more suitable for long-term human settlement (AKA terraforming)! \nThis article was originally published with Universe Today .

Physicists Might Finally Have a Plausible Explanation \nBut it's weird and knotty. MIKE MCRAE 17 OCT 2017 \nYou might never have wondered why the Universe has just three spatial dimensions, but it is a question that has long vexed physicists. \nAn idea that mixes particle physics with something called knot theory could not only offer an explanation, it might also provide insight into what powered the colossal growth-spurt the Universe experienced just moments after its creation. \nThe fact static volumes of space have three degrees of freedom \u2013 width, depth, and length \u2013 seems so fundamental, it's difficult to picture a Universe any other way. \nTry to imagine a 4D hypercube as a real object and you'll quickly feel your brain tap out. \nWe can't rule out the possibility that there are other dimensions of space , folding in on scales so compact we simply can't yet experience them. Models such as string theory make room for a mind-bending nine or more such dimensions. \nBut until we do find solid evidence of their existence, three is all we need to be concerned about on a macro scale of humans, planets, and galaxies. \nAn international team of physicists went searching for a reason behind this magical number, finding a strong contender for a solution in a model they call knotty inflation. \nThe researchers started with some pretty well established physics called flux tubes , which has its roots in James Clerk Maxwell's modelling of electromagnetism in the 19th century. \nFlux tubes are more or less ways of describing channels of the imaginary force lines produced by magnetism. \nWe're familiar with positive and negative electrical charges, and the north and south poles of magnets, as reflections of the same basic phenomenon. \nThe quantum world also has a similar kind of sticky system. So flux tubes can also be used on a quantum scale to explain why specific kinds of particles called quarks bind together to give us chunky sub-atomic particles such as protons and neutrons. \nPulling apart a pair of magnets gives us two smaller magnets, each with a north end and a south end. \nThe quantum world has its own answer to that too, only with a twist; if you pull apart a pair of glued quarks, the flux tube stretches until it snaps. The energy in that field then results in the production of another quark and an antiquark. \nSometimes the pair immediately come together and cancel out. Sometimes each quark grabs onto a separated half of the original pair to make a new partnership. \nQuarks were all the fashion when the Universe was just a few microseconds old . So it stands to reason that flux tubes were probably a big deal then as well. \nThis was the starting place for the physicist's tangled speculations. \n\"We've taken the well-known phenomenon of the flux tube and kicked it up to a higher energy level,\" says researcher Thomas Kephart from Vanderbilt University. \nSnapping a flux tube and popping out a quark and an antiquark should be the end of the story, especially if the quark and antiquark wipe each other out again. \nBut there's a peculiar exception \u2013 these tubes aren't technically restricted to a single-dimensional straight line. Complex arrangements of flux tubes can have different stabilities, some of which are capable of outlasting the quark and antiquark they produce and hanging around as a knot. \nAnd the best configurations for these knots? Yup \u2013 they're most stable in three dimensions. Anything more and they quickly find a way to break apart. \nAs the Universe expanded enough for the quarks to bind together, empty space could have been filled with a tangle of these flux tube knots. \nThe researchers did the math on the energy contained by this fabric of flux tubes and found it was enough to drive a period known as inflation . \nOur Universe looks pretty much the same in every direction. This makes cosmologists think it went through a dramatic burst of expansion fairly early on, taking it from roughly the size of a proton to about the size of a grapefruit in a fraction of a second. \n\"Not only does our flux tube network provide the energy needed to drive inflation, it also explains why it stopped so abruptly,\" says Kephart . \n\"As the Universe began expanding, the flux-tube network began decaying and eventually broke apart, eliminating the energy source that was powering the expansion.\" \nGiven the stable tubes were knotted in three dimensions, any other degrees of freedom were left in their dust. \nResearchers are already finding odd new physics in experiments recreating the plasma of quarks and their binder particles called gluons. \nWhile this research is a neat model, it might not be long before we have more solid evidence that our Universe had a rather twisted history. \nThis research was published in the European Physical Journal C .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas kephart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kephart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike mcrae", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vanderbilt university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european physical journal c", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james clerk maxwell", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T16:04:21.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95bf1172529da5333af47431f9fc02281ae844fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGTJNo5TjHzD5e8KqOHDWzjORxV7pAMQmerLNacwqhL6wx.mBxhISWevLp5QFx70udCaLoDkGV9FLVX9TxwEdFHJxqU1I.bfw6hPpZjJk1Laq7zQb6.TcBWloQcEpSnecP", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "The Weather on Saturn's Moon Titan Is Even More Extreme And Earth-Like Than We Thought", "title_full": "The Weather on Saturn's Moon Titan Is Even More Extreme And Earth-Like Than We Thought", "published": "2017-10-17T14:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/titan_web_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 20, "comments": 0, "shares": 20}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95bf1172529da5333af47431f9fc02281ae844fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGTJNo5TjHzD5e8KqOHDWzjORxV7pAMQmerLNacwqhL6wx.mBxhISWevLp5QFx70udCaLoDkGV9FLVX9TxwEdFHJxqU1I.bfw6hPpZjJk1Laq7zQb6.TcBWloQcEpSnecP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Williams, Universe Today", "published": "2017-10-17T14:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Weather on Saturn's Moon Titan Is Even More Extreme And Earth-Like Than We Thought", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd.

DAVID NIELD 18 OCT 2017 \nWaves rippling across a lake can also cause faint rumblings in Earth itself, according to scientists, giving us clues about the condition of a lake and its surrounding geology through the readings of a seismometer. \nFor instance, scientists could be able to tell whether a lake was frozen over without direct observations, just from the seismic readings in the surrounding area. \nThese seismic shudders wouldn't be strong enough to feel if you were standing there on the ground. But with the right instruments they could allow us to map climate change and take other readings across wide areas, suggest the researchers from the University of Utah and Yunnan University in China. \n\"It's kind of a new phenomenon,\" says one of the researchers , Keith Koper from the University of Utah. \"We don't really know how it's created.\" \nSmall bursts of seismic activity, called microseisms , are already known to form from ocean waves dragging across the sea floor \u2013 they're part of the background seismic noise observed in coastal locations. \nStudying waves from lakes in this way is a newer idea , and the researchers used data from earlier studies alongside new readings from Yellowstone Lake in Wyoming as well as Dianchi Lake , Fuxian Lake , and Erhai Lake in China. \n\"The lakes span more than two orders of magnitude in size (areas from 210 km2 to 27,000 km2) and sample a range of climatic and tectonic regimes in Canada, the US, and China,\" the researchers write in their study. \nWhat they found was that by averaging seismic activity over longer periods, like six months or so, it's possible to create what the scientists call a \" CT scan of the Earth\". \nThese small seismic waves travel through different geological materials at different speeds, enabling scientists to work out the composition of the ground around a lake \u2013 and without the need for an artificial shock like an explosion or vibrating plates. \n\"It would take quite a bit of effort and work to generate this level of energy [artificially],\" says Koper . \nThe study found that these lake microseisms could act as accurate predictors of how an earthquake might affect an area, as well as picking up on whether or not a lake was frozen over, which affects the speed of the ripples. \nRather than satellite readings or field trips, scientists could use autonomous seismometers to check the changes in seasonal temperatures around a lake. When the known freezing and thawing times for Yellowstone Lake were compared to interpretations of the seismic data, everything matched up. \nFor remote lakes high above sea level, which are useful indicators of our changing climate , that sort of automatic monitoring could prove very helpful. \nThe next step in the research is to understand exactly how ripples on a lake lead to ripples underground, and to do that more data and more instruments are going to be required. \n\"If we can record at the same time on land and underwater, we can get a better idea of how these things are generated,\" says Koper . \nThe findings have been published in the Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "keith koper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david nield", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "journal of geophysical research solid earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yunnan university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fuxian lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erhai lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dianchi lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yellowstone lake", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T03:29:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1354d09d14cfdcb2fb0dd56b064e669b899421c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGX1hnCvBxUKsj8f84Dl2gaPBTrcdD5gcUyjP1FohqRQzGQmwuwcoYY2DMNaEqKfA4mJNkDXugrN00ARfnqmWFsQ--", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "Blood Transfusions From Some Women Can Be More Dangerous For Men, Says Study", "title_full": "Blood Transfusions From Some Women Can Be More Dangerous For Men, Says Study", "published": "2017-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/blood_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1920, "comments": 0, "shares": 1920}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1354d09d14cfdcb2fb0dd56b064e669b899421c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGX1hnCvBxUKsj8f84Dl2gaPBTrcdD5gcUyjP1FohqRQzGQmwuwcoYY2DMNaEqKfA4mJNkDXugrN00ARfnqmWFsQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michelle Starr", "published": "2017-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blood Transfusions From Some Women Can Be More Dangerous For Men, Says Study", "text": "print \nAlex Wong/Getty Images Men who received blood transfusions from women who'd been pregnant had a higher mortality rate than those who received blood from female donors who'd never been pregnant, according to a new study. Doctors do not yet have an explanation for the correlation but theorize that it may have to do with changes to the immune system during pregnancy. Further research is still needed to determine the significance of the findings. \nProviding a detailed medical history when donating blood could be more important than we know \u2014 and not just when it comes to screening for disease. New research has found that men have a far higher mortality rate after receiving blood transfusions using the donor blood of women who have been pregnant. But no one knows why. \nMen who received donor blood from women who had been pregnant had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to those who received blood from other men, or women who had never been pregnant, the study has found. \nFor men under 50, that rate was 1.5 times more in the three years following the transfusion - and the most likely cause of death was an adverse immune response called transfusion-related acute lung injury , an increased risk of which has been previously associated with female donors . \nThe study, funded by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports, included 31,118 patients who had between them received 59,320 transfusions of red blood cells in the Netherlands between 2005 and 2015. \nFlickr/makelessnoise \nThe donors were in three categories: male donors, female donors who had never been pregnant (never-pregnant), and female donors who had been pregnant (ever-pregnant). They made up 88 percent, 6 percent and 6 percent of the donor pool respectively. \nThe patient mortality rate was 3,939 people - 13 percent. And of that number, statistically the largest group was men who had received blood from ever-pregnant donors. \n\"Among patients who received red blood cell transfusions, receipt of a transfusion from an ever-pregnant female donor, compared with a male donor, was associated with increased all-cause mortality among male recipients but not among female recipients,\" the researchers wrote in the study . \n\"Transfusions from never-pregnant female donors were not associated with increased mortality among male or female recipients.\" \nThe mortality rate for men receiving red blood from ever-pregnant donors was 101 deaths per 1,000 person-years , compared to 80 deaths for male donors and 78 deaths for never-pregnant donors. \nWhile the study shows a correlation, it doesn't explain why blood from previously pregnant women would have such an effect. The researchers do hypothesize that there could be a \"possible mechanism based on immunologic changes occurring during pregnancy\". \nIn an accompanying editorial, two doctors from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, who were not involved in the study, flag that the next important step will be to look into the potential mechanisms. \n\"These results are provocative and may - if true - have significant clinical implications. However, other studies have reported conflicting results, and the methodology of these types of studies is complex,\" they write . \n\"Therefore, alternative explanations for the observed associations should be considered.\" \nIt's also worth nothing that even though the study included a large group of people and a 10-year timeframe, it is limited by the fact the scientists worked with retrospective data. \nA study released earlier this year that included 968,264 transfusion recipients did not find the same correlation - but then, it did not analyze the results by donor sex. \nBoth the researchers and the editorial authors agree that there's more work to be done. \n\"Further research is needed to replicate these findings, determine their clinical significance, and identify the underlying mechanism,\" the researchers wrote in their paper .

All rights reserved. Kanuman/Shutterstock A Giant Volcano Eruption Could Have Sparked The Collapse of Ancient Egypt \nDon't blame Cleopatra. 18 OCT 2017 \nCleopatra's suicide and the fall of ancient Egypt is the stuff of legend. Shakespearean drama aside, there is often far more fuelling the collapse of an empire than political squabbling alone. \nNow researchers have traced a domino effect of social upheaval and devastating climate change back to an erupting volcano, possibly as far as the other side of the globe. \nA team of historians has linked evidence of volcanic events found in ice-cores with seasonal patterns of the Nile's flooding, arguing this disruption to the life-blood of Egypt could have precipitated events that led to the culture's decline. \nClimate change and social upheaval often go hand in hand, leading to dramatic shifts in politics and economics that can see entire civilisations come and go. \nSo the idea isn't an outlandish one. But even reasonable hypotheses need solid evidence. \n\"That's the beauty of these climate records,\" says researcher Joseph Manning from Yale University. \n\"For the first time, you can actually see a dynamic society in Egypt, not just a static description of a bunch of texts in chronological order.\" \nThe team relied on previous research detailing the timing of significant volcanic eruptions over the past 2,500 years. \nVolcanoes don't have to be spewing lava into your backyard to be a problem. Ash and particles of sulphur can form aerosols that disperse through the stratosphere, reflecting sunlight in ways that can affect temperature and rainfall far from the eruption site. \nTo determine how Egypt's seasonal weather might have been affected by any timely eruptions, the researchers turned to a monument known as al-Miqyas, or the Islamic Nilometer . \nThis stunning piece of architecture is a mix of art, water source, and historical record keeping. \nThe structure has preserved a record of the Nile's summer peaks since the early 7th century, allowing the researchers to model a relationship between the river's flow and years there was an eruption somewhere on the planet. \nFor details on the Nile's cycle prior to this period of history, the team had to dig a bit deeper and interpret historical writings. \nThe results was a picture of the river's heartbeat over the course of Egypt's history, one that reflected the planet's tectonic activity. \n\"When the Nile flood was good, the Nile valley was one of the most agriculturally-productive places in the ancient world,\" says climate historian Francis Ludlow from Trinity College in Dublin. \n\"But the river was famously prone to a high level of variation.\" \nThe Nile is famous today for being the world's longest river, but for the ancient Egyptians it was the centre of everything. \nEvery summer, monsoons from the equator would wash over the Nile's upper reaches, providing a source of water than would wash silt down the river. \nWithout this yearly delivery of fertile soil and water Egypt's crops would falter, leading to food shortages. Not to mention a lot of unhappy customers. \nHistorical records indicate that one such period occurred during the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty, which began with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE. \nIn roughly 44 BCE, during the reign of Queen Cleopatra VII , a particularly severe volcanic eruption somewhere else in the world blasted a plume of ash and hot gases into the atmosphere, suppressing the monsoons and giving rise to a serious famine. \nClearly there was a lot going on in the world at this time, what with Rome marching all over Europe and the Mediterranean like it owned everything. \nBut Cleopatra's rule wasn't in any way helped by a food shortage that upset the economy and helped smooth the way for a plague or two as country folk swarmed into the cities. \nUltimately this social unrest made it much easier for Rome to pick up the pieces once Cleopatra tragically left the scene in 30 BCE, possibly poisoned if not bitten by an asp. \nVolcanoes might also help explain another Ptolemaic mystery. \nThe Roman historian Justinus wrote of the war monger Ptolemy III , if he \"had not been recalled to Egypt by disturbances at home, would have made himself master of all Seleucus's dominions\". \nWhat disturbances made it so important that one of the dynasty's most successful rulers would give up trying to add more of what is today Iraq and Syria to his borders and trot back home? \nIt seems we could also blame a volcano for kicking off that social grumble as well. \nWe're yet to see any volcanic interruptions to monsoons this century. \n\"But that could change at any time,\" says Manning . \n\"The potential for this needs to be taken into account in trying to agree on how the valuable waters of the Blue Nile are going to be managed between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt.\" \nThis research was published in Nature Communications .

Visun Khankasem/Shutterstock.com A Faked Study Linking Vaccines And Autism Is Being Eviscerated by Scientists \nDumpster fire coming through. 18 OCT 2017 \nControversy has erupted over a scientific paper that is being retracted after it was attacked for being ' antivax pseudoscience ' and found to contain manipulated, false data\u2026 which has now gone mysteriously AWOL . \nThe research , published last month, suggested aluminium contained in vaccine adjuvants could trigger biological responses in mice \"consistent with those in autism\", but it didn't take long for scientific commentators to tear the paper apart. \n\"By even the most charitable interpretation, the best that can be said for this study is that it might show increased levels of proteins associated with inflammation in the brains of mice who had been injected with aluminium adjuvant way more frequently than human babies ever would be,\" wrote oncologist David Gorski from Wayne State University on his blog at ScienceBlogs . \n\"It was, as so many studies before, the torture of mice in the name of antivax pseudoscience.\" \nSeveral other commentators in the research community also found faults with the research, singling out its authors as \"anti-vaccine shills\" and providing blow-by-blow takedowns in what they called an \"[a]utopsy of a flawed study of aluminium and brain inflammation\". \nTough crowd. \nBut the most damning indictment on the research came when users on community science site PubPeer noticed several instances where the graphics and results in the study's data had been deliberately manipulated, copied and pasted, and generally faked. \nFor John Dawson, the editor of the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry in which the paper was published, that was the last straw, telling Retraction Watch that the study was \"being retracted jointly by the authors and the editor\". \nIn separate comments, one of the senior authors of the paper, Christopher Shaw from the University of British Columbia in Canada, told the site it was a mystery how the manipulated data made its way into their research. \n\"Our own analysis showed some figures had been altered,\" he said . \n\"We requested a retraction because we could not understand how that had happened. We felt the data had been compromised.\" \nPubPeer \nShaw maintains that the original data used in the research, which began years ago, has subsequently been taken to China by the paper's first author, and cannot be easily recovered for verification. \n\"The first author, Dr. Dan Li, denies doing anything wrong, but has not provided any information about this in spite of repeated questions from us,\" he explained to Beth Mole at Ars Technica . \n\"We are continuing to pursue these questions, but as she is now at another institution, we can't force her to comply.\" \nAs for how the mistakes and falsifications got missed before they were published, Shaw says they're basically impossible to catch. \n\"When you look at these kinds of [data], unless you look at them under very, very high power and magnify them 20 times \u2013 which no one does, by the way \u2013 you would not necessarily see that there was anything untoward,\" he told CBC News . \nAs for where that leaves us, it's unclear.

MICHELLE STARR 18 OCT 2017 Get ready to have your perception of the cute little green tree frog irrevocably shattered - and it's all thanks to this old photo that led us down a rabbithole of green tree frog bastardry. \nThe photo shows the head of a small snake, open-mouthed, as it disappears down the gullet of an Australian green tree frog. It's been around for a few years at least, but it's seeing a viral resurgence via a reddit post in /r/WTF titled \" One Last Scream Into The Aby .\" \nWe don't know who took the photo, or where, or when. We do know that the frog is an Australian green tree frog, or Litoria caerulea , confirmed by UNSW and Australian Museum biologist Jodi Rowley on Twitter . \nThe snake could be a brown snake, as per this post on Google Plus from November 2016. \n\"This is an Australian Green Tree Frog eating a Brown Snake,\" the post reads . \n\"Previous to the capture, I had been led to believe that they ate only insects. The Australian Brown Snake is highly venomous. Although the snake had bitten the frog, as you will see if you enlarge the photo, the frog survived. Not such a happy ending for the snake however ... \" \nThe internet being what it is, and the photo apparently having been around since before November 2016, we can't be sure of the veracity of the post, but it sure looks like a brown snake. \nAnother possibility, Rowley said, is that it could be a juvenile keelback - brown snakes are quite venomous, and although we don't know the effect of brown snake venom on frogs, odds are good that it's not positive. \nIt would have to be a juvenile, though. Australian green tree frogs only grow to around 12 centimetres (5 inches) in length, while adult brown snakes average 1.5 metres (5 feet) and keelbacks grow up to 1 metre (3.2 feet). \nThe photo looks like it could be a cunning photo edit (and indeed has been the subject of a Photoshop battle ), but it's not unknown for frogs to enjoy this sort of meal. \nGreen tree frogs mostly eat insects , but they have also been known to take down larger prey, such as bats or mice. They've also been observed feasting on a carpet python , and a venomous red-bellied black snake . \nThey'll even eat other frogs . Basically, if it's small enough to go down the frog's gullet, and passes within chomping range, the frog is going to have a go. \n\"It's relatively common (as far as frogs-eating-things go) to see Australian green tree frogs eating snakes,\" Rowley told ScienceAlert. \n\"They are 'garbage-guts'. Most frog species will actually eat anything that looks like it'll fit in their mouth that moves in front of them. It's instinct. They eat first (or try to) and think later. The frog likely just grabbed whatever bit of the snake it could, using its hands to try and shove it down.\" \nFor both reptiles and amphibians, it's a cutthroat world out there. As Stephen Sondheim wrote in his famous musical Sweeney Todd, \"The history of the world, my sweet, is who gets eaten and who gets to eat.\" \nIf the frog hadn't eaten the snake, no doubt the snake would have eaten its share of frogs, as they form a crucial part of the diet of many snakes. \nSnakes also munch on other reptiles, like this alligator lizard , who fought all the way down and apparently ended up escaping from its snake-belly doom. And a simple search for \"python eats alligator\" on YouTube yields up some interesting stuff, if you like watching animal violence. \nIf you know who took this photo, reach out to us on Twitter . We'd love to know more about it. \nThis story was updated on 19/10/17 with additional information from Jodi Rowley.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sweeney todd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen sondheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michelle starr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jodi rowley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unsw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litoria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T09:24:49.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0bb6d61e70ac9d13d5c342339eb44ae74c917643", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGhY9HtB1zXPIM8hPBAnEj.hHaxqLPVuwI1QGQ9DBpbbEbBU67J7rm8LZr29Evt6y4Q4PzhQoZcSfqOZlTWNgkIW6yKLDZO7Oa", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "World's Most Intense Laser Is About to Get a Totally Insane Upgrade", "title_full": "World's Most Intense Laser Is About to Get a Totally Insane Upgrade", "published": "2017-10-18T11:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/hercules_laser_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 8, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 831, "comments": 0, "shares": 831}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0bb6d61e70ac9d13d5c342339eb44ae74c917643", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGhY9HtB1zXPIM8hPBAnEj.hHaxqLPVuwI1QGQ9DBpbbEbBU67J7rm8LZr29Evt6y4Q4PzhQoZcSfqOZlTWNgkIW6yKLDZO7Oa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike McRae", "published": "2017-10-18T11:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "World's Most Intense Laser Is About to Get a Totally Insane Upgrade", "text": "\u00a9 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. Joseph Xu, Michigan Engineering World's Most Intense Laser Is About to Get a Totally Insane Upgrade \nPew pew pew! 18 OCT 2017 \nA $US2 million upgrade could soon see the world's most intense laser crank it up a notch. \nThe laser they call HERCULES (because of course it is) is already currently capable of emitting a terrifying 300 terawatts of power. Clearly in a case of laser envy, a few new parts could see it spit out 1,000 terawatt beams of light, enough to produce next generation particle accelerators that could fit on your dining room table. \nHERCULES is getting a little old for lasers, being built back in 2007 when 300 terawatts was something to crow about. \nThat doesn't mean you shouldn't be impressed. Assuming 1,360 watts of sunlight hit your average square metre, 300 terawatts would be more or less like collecting the light that falls on an area the size of Nebraska. And then some. \nBut what really makes it impressive is that HERCULES focusses all that light to an area that's about a 100th the diameter of a human hair for 30 femtoseconds. \nCue the pew-pew noises. HERCULES holds the record for energy focused on a tiny area, which is 2 x 10^22 (20 sextillion) watts per square centimetre. \nHowever, when it comes to raw power, other lasers are now capable of generating around 2 petawatts \u2013 or 2 trillion watts \u2013 of energy for about a picosecond. \nTo make this kind of flash of light, super lasers like HERCULES rely on a technology called pumping. Laser pumps beef up the laser's power by channelling energy from an outside source into some kind of medium. \nWhen HERCULES was first constructed, its engineers had to build its pump lasers from scratch to have any hope of hitting their goal of 300 terawatts. \nNow that death-star-type lasers are the coolest things everybody wants one, so better pump lasers are available on the market. \nWith a grant from the US National Science Foundation, HERCULES can now have a pump laser upgrade that will see it shine with between 500 and 1,000 terawatts of awesomeness. \nThat will put it in the ballpark of world's most powerful lasers once again. \nIt should also mean it will blow its old intensity record out of the water, doubling or even tripling its old score. \nWhy bother, you say? \nIf you're one of those sort of folk who need a reason for lasers of ridiculous intensity, here's four: Intense lasers like HERCULES can kick tiny particles up to crazy speeds in short distances, paving the way for future particle accelerators that can fit inside your laboratory. Want high-energy X-rays that can discriminate between soft tissues? Right now the best we can do with X-rays is tell the difference between bone and squishy bits. One day physicians will wonder how they ever managed with such feeble X-ray technology. Thank HERCULES! How are gamma ray bursts produced in space? With the recent observation of colliding neutron stars , we're well on our way to understanding this phenomenon better. But we'd learn a lot more if we could generate strong magnetic fields on a microscopic scale, something an intense laser like HERCULES might manage with an upgrade. HERCULES could simulate conditions that could be used to study perfect vacuums, allowing researchers to explore how particles pop out of nothingness. \n\"This upgrade enables a wide variety of different experiments,\" says Karl Krushelnick , director of the Centre for Ultrafast Optical Science which houses HERCULES. \n\"There are these exciting applications, and it also opens up a new regime at the very frontier of plasma physics, where quantum phenomena start to play an important role.\" \nWe agree they're exciting, and look forward to learning more about gamma ray bursts and ghostly particles. \nLong live HERC!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph xu", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "karl krushelnick", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sciencealert pty ltd", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "us national science foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centre for ultrafast optical science", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "michigan engineering world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T09:37:12.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45f96dbe33e5bf31aaa76d9ca2cdf320ac079ed9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGLNrrlE6eMglGXNukOww0caSdzb9HqbUGGZp3ydYvAFiaPJMldmit8dLLWacaFP1TmcPFqx33LsOGzVNvQu3P9XbIzdUu7fzQ", "site_full": "www.sciencealert.com", "site": "sciencealert.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/sciencealert-latestnews", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "ScienceAlert - Latest", "title": "It Seems More Likely Than Ever That Mars Once Had Both Liquid Water And Surface Ice", "title_full": "It Seems More Likely Than Ever That Mars Once Had Both Liquid Water And Surface Ice", "published": "2017-10-18T10:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/triple_crater7003_web_1024.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 5066, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1387, "comments": 0, "shares": 1387}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45f96dbe33e5bf31aaa76d9ca2cdf320ac079ed9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ZCsEJGOdeGgggPTgDELoGLNrrlE6eMglGXNukOww0caSdzb9HqbUGGZp3ydYvAFiaPJMldmit8dLLWacaFP1TmcPFqx33LsOGzVNvQu3P9XbIzdUu7fzQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Williams, Universe Today", "published": "2017-10-18T10:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "It Seems More Likely Than Ever That Mars Once Had Both Liquid Water And Surface Ice", "text": "It Seems More Likely Than Ever That Mars Once Had Both Liquid Water And Surface Ice \nThe wet Red Planet? 18 OCT 2017 \nThanks to decades of exploration using robotic orbiter missions, landers and rovers, scientists are certain that billions of years ago, liquid water flowed on the surface of Mars. \nBeyond that, many questions have remained, which include whether or not the waterflow was intermittent or regular. In other words, was Mars truly a \"warm and wet\" environment billions of years ago, or was it more along the lines of \"cold and icy\"? \nThese questions have persisted due to the nature of Mars' surface and atmosphere, which offer conflicting answers. According to a new study from Brown University, it appears that both could be the case. \nBasically, early Mars could have had significant amounts of surface ice which experienced periodic melting, producing enough liquid water to carve out the ancient valleys and lakebeds seen on the planet today. \nAshley Palumbo \u2013 a Ph.D. student with Brown's Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Science \u2013 led the study and was joined by her supervising professor, Jim Head, and Professor Robin Wordsworth of Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences . \nExtensive valley networks suggest Mars once had flowing water. Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Arizona State University \nFor the sake of their study, Palumbo and her colleagues sought to find the bridge between Mars' geology (which suggests the planet was once warm and wet) and its atmospheric models, which suggest it was cold and icy. \nAs they demonstrated, it's plausible that during the past, Mars was generally frozen over with glaciers. During peak daily temperatures in the summer, these glaciers would melt at the edges to produce flowing water. \nAfter many years, they concluded, these small deposits of meltwater would have been enough to carve the features observed on the surface today. Most notably, they could have carved the kinds of valley networks that have been observed on Mars southern highlands. \nAs Palumbo explained in a Brown University press release, their study was inspired by similar climate dynamics that take place here on Earth: \n\"We see this in the Antarctic Dry Valleys, where seasonal temperature variation is sufficient to form and sustain lakes even though mean annual temperature is well below freezing. We wanted to see if something similar might be possible for ancient Mars.\" \nTo determine the link between the atmospheric models and geological evidence, Palumbo and her team began with a state-of-the-art climate model for Mars. \nThis model assumed that 4 billion years ago, the atmosphere was primarily composed of carbon dioxide (as it is today) and that the Sun's output was much weaker than it is now. From this model, they determined that Mars was generally cold and icy during its earlier days. \nNanedi Valles. Image: ESA/DLR/FU Berlin (G. Neukum) \nHowever, they also included a number of variables which may have also been present on Mars 4 billion years ago. These include the presence of a thicker atmosphere, which would have allowed for a more significant greenhouse effect. \nSince scientists cannot agree how dense Mars' atmosphere was between 4.2 and 3.7 billion years ago, Palumbo and her team ran the models to take into account various plausible levels of atmospheric density. \nThey also considered variations in Mars' orbit that could have existed 4 billion years ago, which has also been subject to some guesswork. \nHere too, they tested a wide range of plausible scenarios, which included differences in axial tilt and different degrees of eccentricity. This would have affected how much sunlight is received by one hemisphere over another and led to more significant seasonal variations in temperature. \nIn the end, the model produced scenarios in which ice covered regions near the location of the valley networks in the southern highlands. While the planet's mean annual temperature in these scenarios was well below freezing, it also produced peak summertime temperatures in the region that rose above freezing. \nThe only thing that remained was to demonstrate that the volume of water produced would be enough to carve those valleys. \nLuckily, back in 2015, Professor Jim Head and Eliot Rosenberg (an undergraduate with Brown at the time) created a study which estimated the minimum amount of water required to produce the largest of these valleys. \nUsing these estimates, along with other studies that provided estimates of necessary runoff rates and the duration of valley network formation, Palumbo and her colleagues found a model-derived scenario that worked. \nKevin Gill \nBasically, they found that if Mars that had an eccentricity of 0.17 (compared to it's current eccentricity of 0.0934) an axial tilt of 25\u00b0 (compared to 25.19\u00b0 today), and an atmospheric pressure of 600 mbar (100 times what it is today) then it would have taken about 33,000 to 1,083,000 years to produce enough meltwater to form the valley networks. \nBut assuming for a circular orbit, an axial tile of 25\u00b0, and an atmosphere of 1000 mbar, it would have taken about 21,000 to 550,000 years. \nThe degrees of eccentricity and axial tilt required in these scenarios are well within the range of possible orbits for Mars 4 billion years ago. And as Head indicated , this study could reconcile the atmospheric and geological evidence that has been at odds in the past: \n\"This work adds a plausible hypothesis to explain the way in which liquid water could have formed on early Mars, in a manner similar to the seasonal melting that produces the streams and lakes we observe during our field work in the Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valleys. We are currently exploring additional candidate warming mechanisms, including volcanism and impact cratering, that might also contribute to melting of a cold and icy early Mars.\" \nIt is also significant in that it demonstrates that Mars climate was subject to variations that also happen regularly here on Earth. This provides yet another indication of how our two plane's are similar in some ways, and how research of one can help advance our understanding of the other. \nLast, but not least, it offers some synthesis to a subject that has produced a fair share of disagreement. \nThe subject of how Mars could have experienced warm, flowing water on its surface \u2013 and at a time when the Sun's output was much weaker than it is today \u2013 has remained the subject of much debate. \nIn recent years, researchers have advanced various suggestions as to how the planet could have been warmed, ranging from cirrus clouds to periodic bursts of methane gas from the beneath the surface. \nWhile this latest study has not quite settled the debate between the \"warm and watery\" and the \"cold and icy\" camps, it does offer compelling evidence that the two may not be mutually exclusive. \nThe study was also the subject of a presentation made at the 48th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference , which took place from March 20th to 24th in The Woodland, Texas. \nThis article was originally published with Universe Today .

All rights reserved. Elvis Popovic This Overlooked Theory Could Be The Missing Piece That Explains How The EM Drive Works \nWhat if it doesn't break the laws of physics? FIONA MACDONALD 7 OCT 2017 \nEver since the EM drive first made headlines , science lovers have puzzled over how the propulsion system seems to produce thrust , despite the fact it's 'impossible' according to one of the most fundamental laws of physics - Newton's third law of motion. \nNow a team of physicists have put forward an alternative explanation - it turns out the EM drive could actually work without breaking any scientific laws, if we factor in a weird and often overlooked idea in quantum physics - pilot wave theory . \nFor those who need a refresher, the crux of the problem here is that the EM, or electromagnetic, drive appears to produce thrust without any fuel or propellant. \nThat's awesome because it means we can get to space with way less pay load - it's proposed it could even get us to Mars within 72 days . \nBut it's also perplexing, because, according to Newton's third law, every action must have an equal and opposite reaction. So without pushing any propellant out one end, the drive shouldn't be able to produce thrust in the opposite direction. \nStill, as a NASA peer-reviewed paper showed last year , the drive does produce thrust, at least as far as we can currently tell. And a relatively large amount of thrust at that. We just don't know how. \nSo either our understanding of physics isn't right, or we're missing a big piece of the puzzle when it comes to the EM drive. \nA new paper published in The Journal of Applied Physical Science International makes the argument that what we're missing is pilot wave theory - a slightly controversial alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics. \nResearchers Jos\u00e9 Croca and Paulo Castro from the Centre for Philosophy of Sciences of the University of Lisbon in Portugal suggest that not only could pilot wave theory explain the mysterious behaviour of the EM drive, it could help to make it even more powerful. \n\"We have found that applying a pilot wave theory to NASA's EM drive frustum [or cone], we could explain its thrust without involving any external action applied to the system, as Newton's third law would require,\" Castro told ScienceAlert via email. \nSo what is pilot wave theory? Currently, the majority of physicists subscribe to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which states that particles do not have defined locations until they are observed. \nPilot wave theory, on the other hand, suggests that particles do have precise positions at all times, but in order for this to be the case, the world must also be strange in other ways \u2013 which is why many physicists have dismissed the idea. \nBut in recent years, the pilot wave theory has been increasing in popularity . The team has shown in its latest paper this theory could be tweaked slightly to apply to something bigger. Say, the EM drive. And it could explain the results we've been seeing. \nBasically, pilot wave theory says that an object radiates a wave field, and it is then pulled or attracted to regions of that field that have higher intensity or energy density. In that way, the wave field is actually 'piloting' the object, hence the name. \nThrough modelling, the team showed that a sufficiently strong and asymmetrical electromagnetic field could act as a pilot wave. And that's exactly what the EM drive generates. \nBecause the cone, or frustum, of the EM drive is asymmetrical, it would also generate an asymmetrical wave field. As a result, the walls of the EM drive would move towards the areas of higher intensity, creating thrust. \nWhile that might sound pretty out there, this was also actually a possible solution put forward by the NASA Eagleworks researchers in their seminal paper last year where they first reported the thrust generated by their device: \n\"[The] supporting physics model used to derive a force based on operating conditions in the test article can be categorised as a nonlocal hidden-variable theory, or pilot-wave theory for short.\" \nTo be clear, the researchers from the University of Lisbon haven't tested their proposal in a real device as yet. \nThey've only shown that it's possible, from a modelling point of view, for a pilot wave to guide the EM drive. But they've also shown how the idea could actually be tested in future. \n\"At the moment the most stringent empirical evidence comes from the EM drive behaviour,\" Castro told ScienceAlert. \"However, we have also devised an experiment to detect and modulate subquantum waves.\" \nImportantly, if the hypothesis is confirmed, it would mean the EM drive would not have to break Newton's third law. And the team hopes this might result in the device being taken seriously and more widely tested. \"EM drive is the future of space propelling motors,\" they said. \"[Although] it will perhaps find its initial application in nano satellites or nano drones, at least before the effect can be scaled up to heavier machines.\" \nImportantly, if a pilot wave does explain the thrust behind the device, then it could also lead to a way to make the propulsion system even more powerful in future, and it's as simple as tweaking the shape. \"We have seen that the effect could be enhanced using a different shape for the frustum,\" said Castro. \"In fact a trumpet exponential form is expected to increase the thrust.\" The team is now considering building its own experimental set up to study the phenomena and has invited anyone interested in the project to get in touch . In the meantime, the NASA Eagleworks team continues to test out its device. And there are also groups looking to test the EM drive in space - or according to some rumours, already doing so - which would really show once and for all whether it works. \nThere's a lot we have yet to learn about the mysterious EM drive and it's a topic that continues to divide the science world. But whether or not it ends up being the future of space travel, at least it's teaching us more about the physics that govern our world. \nThe new research has been published in The Journal of Applied Physical Science International .

All rights reserved. A fragment of a woven sash. (Annika Larsson/Uppsala University) The Word 'Allah' Has Been Discovered Woven Into Viking Burial Clothes Okay, we're surprised. 13 OCT 2017 Ancient burial clothes thought to have been woven with typical Viking patterns have, after decades in storage, revealed a surprise: geometric Kufic script spelling out the words \"Ali\" and \"Allah,\" woven in silver thread onto silk. It's the first time historic artefacts mentioning \"Ali\" have been found in Scandinavia, marking this as an important archaeological discovery. \nWhile at first glance this appears to be a surprising find, it doesn't even seem that uncommon - the script was found on at least 10 silk clothing items out of 100 from 9th and 10th century boat graves around Gamla, Uppsala, as well as chamber graves in Viking Era sites such as Birka in Swedish M\u00e4lardalen. \nThe discovery was made when a team of researchers was trying to recreate the patterns on burial garments in storage for the then upcoming Viking Couture exhibit at Enk\u00f6ping Museum in Sweden. \n\"This is a very important discovery because it tells us we can't view this historical period as 'typically Nordic',\" Annika Larsson, a textile archaeologist at Uppsala University, told The Local . \n\"It shows us that the Vikings were in close contact with other cultures, including with the Islamic world.\" \nEvidence for a connection between the Vikings and the Muslim world has been mounting for years now. \nIn 2009 , researchers found that Viking Ara swords used Arab metalsmithing techniques, probably transferred via the Volga trade route . \nPersian silk has also been found in a Viking longboat burial in Norway . \nInitially, Larsson said, she couldn't make sense of the designs, but then she remembered where she had seen something similar: on Moorish textiles from Spain. \nAnalysis of the materials, weaving techniques and designs suggest Central Asian and Persian origin. \nAnnika Larsson, Uppsala University \nThe word \"Ali\" was relatively easy to decipher, but Allah was a little more tricky - because it had been mirrored, as seen in the image above. \nThe reason for this is unknown, but the most likely explanation is that the pattern had simply been copied incorrectly, as Amir De Martino of the Islamic College in London told the BBC . \nLarsson believes that the presence of the names on the garments, always appearing together, indicate that the Vikings didn't just trade goods with the Muslim world, but perhaps also burial customs and ideas. \n\"Presumably, Viking Age burial customs were influenced by Islam and the idea of an eternal life in Paradise after death,\" she said in a statement . \n\"Grave goods such as beautiful clothing, finely sewn in exotic fabrics, hardly reflect the deceased's everyday life, just as little as the formal attire of our era reflects our own daily lives. The rich material of grave goods should rather be seen as tangible expressions of underlying values.\" \nIt's not uncommon for graves to include objects and clothing as opulent and rich as the family could afford. \nFurther analysis will be required to learn more, and this is being carried out on the people who were buried with the garments to determine whether they was people from Persia or - much more likely - Vikings wearing Islamic textiles. \n\"The quality of Islamic silk textiles was such that they were highly coveted and used in Christian churches across Europe, and for vestments,\" dress and textile historian Hilary Davidson of the University of Sydney, who is researching transmisson of Islamic and Byzantine textiles in medieval Christian clothing, told ScienceAlert. \n\"They were valued for their quality and beauty, not their religious context, which in any case became divorced through trading patterns. These silks were traded across Europe for centuries, and it is possible that the Norse Kufic patterns are imitating the pattern of Islamic textiles without knowing what the meaning is. \n\"They might be trade goods applied to Viking clothing as examples of high status, high quality silk and metal textiles.\" \nNow that the presence of the patterns is known, it may be easier in the future to identify it in other textiles, and perhaps even other artefacts. \nLarsson's finding are currently on display as part of the Viking Couture exhibition at Enk\u00f6ping Museum , which runs until 3 February, 2018.

SIGNE DEAN 16 OCT 2017 \nAs the unofficial world's most futuristic city, Dubai sure loves the attention it gets from employing cutting-edge tech such as 3D-printed buildings , hovertaxis , or this incredible Mars simulation city . \nNow Dubai's police force, already equipped with little autonomous robocops , is getting another leg up in the law enforcement race with incredibly cool, and somewhat dangerous-looking hoverbikes. \nThese airborne police officers will be using the Hoversurf Scorpion-3, a hoverbike prototype built by a Russian drone start-up and revealed earlier this year . \nThe electric-powered Scorpion-3 looks like a cross between a motorcycle and a quadcopter drone. Flying aloft on these, police officers in Dubai will be able to sound like a swarm of very angry bees as they fly across traffic to their next emergency. \nThe new technology to be employed by the city's police was revealed at Gitex 2017 , an international technology showcase currently happening at Dubai World Trade Centre. \nAs Saif Salem Al Kaabi from the Technical Innovation Section at Dubai Police explained to Gulf News , the hoverbike demonstrated at the showcase is still a prototype, and the police force has signed an agreement with the Hoversurf developers to produce a whole fleet. \nThe bikes will be programmed to fly at a maximum altitude of five metres (16.4 feet), and on one charge the electric motor can carry a person for 25 minutes at a maximum speed of 70 km/h (44 mph). \nAccording to a Facebook post by Hoversurf CEO Alexander Atamanov, these hoverbikes have actually set a world record at a 28.5 metre altitude (that's 93.5 feet). But as Al Kaabi explained to Gulf News, for safety reasons the officers will be constrained to travel at just five metres (16.3 feet), which seems fair enough. \nBefore letting these piloted quadcopters loose on the streets, Dubai police will first be doing more testing to decide on the best situations for their use. \nThe thinking is that hoverbikes could come in handy in areas where it's hard for the police to reach with regular vehicles, or in emergencies to fly above traffic congestions. \nIf you haven't seen one of these hoverbikes in action, Hoversurf have footage of the vehicle's first public flight at the Moscow raceway: \nAfter watching that we certainly feel like the future is, well, here.

Paul Thompson, Neda Jahanshad and Conor Corbin Schizophrenia Fries More of The Brain's Wiring Than We Thought, Study Shows \nA huge discovery. 19 OCT 2017 \nSchizophrenia can disrupt the entire communication system running through the brain, a new study has found, affecting more regions of the mind than scientists previously thought and shedding new light on how the condition takes hold. \nIt's the largest study so far of how white matter (the brain's fatty tissue that enables neurons to communicate) relates to a psychiatric disease, and could help us figure out the mechanisms behind schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. \nAccording to the international team of researchers, if we know more about where to look in the brain for the causes and effects of schizophrenia, then we can find more effective treatments \u2013 and this study answers that question of where schizophrenia takes root pretty comprehensively. \n\"We can definitively say for the first time that schizophrenia is a disorder where white matter wiring is frayed throughout the brain,\" says one of the team , Sinead Kelly, who was at the University of Southern California (USC) when the study was conducted, and is now at the Harvard Medical School. \nThe World Health Organisation says 21 million people are affected by schizophrenia worldwide, and up until now it was thought that most of the damage done by the condition was in the prefrontal and temporal lobes. \nThose are the parts of the brain responsible for hearing, defining our personality, and making decisions. \nBut the new study says communications are disrupted all over the brain, like frayed telephone or internet cables \u2013 particularly in the corpus callosum , which controls communication between the two hemispheres of the brain. \nAnother badly affected area was the front part of the corona radiata , one of the brain's key structures for processing information. \nThe researchers pulled together a vast set of data, covering 1,963 people with the disorder and 2,359 healthy controls from 29 different international studies. \nData taken via a form of MRI called diffusion tensor imaging was used, which measures how water molecules move in white matter, and shows where the brain's communication network isn't as well insulated as it should be. \nIt's a pretty bleak picture in terms of the brain damage associated with schizophrenia, but the more we know, the better we can treat the problem. \n\"Our study will help improve the understanding of the mechanisms behind schizophrenia, a mental illness that \u2013 left untreated \u2013 often leads to unemployment, homelessness, substance abuse and even suicide,\" says Kelly . \n\"These findings could lead to the identification of biomarkers that enable researchers to test patients' response to schizophrenia treatment.\" \nWhile we know a lot about the symptoms and consequences of schizophrenia, not much is understood about how it's caused or gets started. Those with the disorder can experience hallucinations and delusions, as well as having trouble thinking and concentrating. \nThough the condition can be managed with drugs, those drugs can have some pretty severe side effects, and we're yet to find any way to cure people completely. \nPart of the work researchers will be doing in the future is examining exactly how these communication networks in white matter get damaged in the first place \u2013 and now they know to look for genes affecting the brain's entire infrastructure, rather than one particular section of internal cabling. \n\"Without this study, future research could have been misdirected,\" says one of the researchers , Neda Jahanshad from USC. \n\"We're showing that just studying a single brain region to try to find out what causes schizophrenia is not a good approach. The effect is global. Focusing on a certain part of the brain where you think that effect will be is not going to give you the whole story.\" \nThe research has been published in Molecular Psychiatry .

MICHELLE STARR 18 OCT 2017 \nWe can't all go to space, but we can now take a poke around our Solar System thanks to Google Maps. \nThe internet giant's mapping service has expanded its map of the nearby celestial bodies to include three new planets and a whole bunch of new moons to explore. And it's even more awesome than it sounds. \nPreviously, the service had only included Earth, of course, along with Mars, the Moon, and the International Space Station, with data collected from the NOAA, the ESO, JAXA, NASA, and in the case of the ISS, astronaut Thomas Pesquet, who captured data for Street View . \nNow we have Venus, Mercury, Pluto and the moons Ceres, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Mimas, Enceladus, Dione, Rhea, Titan and Iapetus to explore, thanks to NASA data. \nYou won't be able to get as up close and personal with these planets as you can with Street View, since we don't have surface-level photographs, but you can spin them around, and have a good zoom in on things - like a nice virtual globe. \n\"Explore the icy plains of Enceladus, where Cassini discovered water beneath the moon's crust - suggesting signs of life,\" Google Street View product manager Stafford Marquardt wrote in a blog post . \n\"Peer beneath the thick clouds of Titan to see methane lakes. Inspect the massive crater of Mimas - while it might seem like a sci-fi look-a-like, it is a moon, not a space station.\" \nImage data was collected together from several NASA and ESA missions, including Cassini , which collected a lot of information and photographs of Saturn and its moons. Pluto data was taken from New Horizons, so a lot of it is pretty blurry, but the detail on the Sleipnir Fossa and the Morgoth Macula is breathtaking. \nMercury was examined in detail by Messenger between 2011 and 2015, and Google credits mapping companies Orion Map Data and AfriGIS for Venus data. \nSome of this data was compiled into maps by astronomical artist Bj\u00f6rn J\u00f3nsson, whose website is really fun to poke around in . \nThere are a few planets missing. For all the Cassini data used, the new lineup has a rather glaring omission - Saturn, the ringed planet. Jupiter also has a probe, Juno , busily collecting data, so maybe we'll see the gas giants join the collection sometime. \nWe don't have probes checking out our ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, but NASA is hoping to get some out there eventually . Given how long the trip to those reaches of the solar system takes, though, they probably won't join the Google Maps fun for at least another decade. \nIn the meantime, though, there's plenty for you to explore. You can check it all out on Google Maps' handy space page . \nOr you could go for space and time with the TARDIS, Google Maps style .
