At first it was almost fun, but as the day drew near and everything became tense, you became a bundle of nerves. You couldn\u2019t share it with anyone, not even with your partner,\u201d the person added.\nOrdering, receiving, and storing 10,000 ballot boxes was challenging. If we were caught, there was no plan B\nA Catalan mayor\nThe purchase of the ballot boxes was perhaps the most important part of the whole operation . \u201cWith the ballots there was more wiggle room. They could be printed at multiple sites and on multiple dates. But ordering 10,000 ballot boxes, receiving them, storing them, and distributing them was more challenging. If we were caught, there was no plan B,\u201d says a mayor of a town on the Mediterranean coast near the city of Girona. \u201cI myself have no idea, nor did I want to know, who took care of it. But it wasn\u2019t more than five or six people.\u201d\nThe boxes were bought from China Smart Dragon Ballot Expert, which sent them to the town of Elna, in French Catalonia near the border, according to Catalan news site Ara . From there, they were brought into Spain by van. The secrecy, and the small number of people who participated in this phase of the operation, prevented details of how they bought and distributed the items from spreading.\n\u201cI did not know, nor wanted to know, anything about the ballot boxes,\u201d says a mayor from the Moian\u00e8s area, north of Barcelona. \u201cWe all knew there was a coordinator and we let that person do their job. The only thing I was told was to stay calm, that [the boxes] would arrive on time,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople might have had their phones tapped, so no one spoke over the phone or sent messages. Everything was done in person.\u201d\nThe boxes passed from trunk to trunk until they reached the school\nA councilor from Bages\nAnother councilor from the neighboring district of Bages in central Catalonia explains that he did not know how the boxes would arrive \u201cuntil a meeting at 9pm on Saturday night. Later I found out [how it worked]. In the town we had three polling stations with 10 ballot boxes and each location had a point person, with a fourth person to coordinate,\u201d he explained.\nIt was the latter who received the call to \u201cgo to a meeting point between 12 and 1am,\u201d the councilor said.\n\u201cThey asked him not to go with his car, but with a friend\u2019s. There, they were given the ballot boxes and they were kept in the trunk all night. Then, between 5 and 7am, he met with those responsible for each polling stations. They were transported one by one in discreet places. The boxes were passed from trunk to trunk until they reached the school,\u201d he added.\nIn many other cases, the ballot boxes arrived in the municipalities days before the vote and were kept in all sorts of places: workshops, homes, cars, and churches. \u201cI received the ballot boxes last Wednesday. A person from the party called me and asked if I would be home that afternoon. It was the signal,\u201d explained the mayor of Empord\u00e0, in northern Catalonia. \u201cI took two to the attic and I kept another one in a room. The worst moment was when I saw my daughter, who is eight years old. I had to turn to the poor girl and say seriously, \u2018You didn\u2019t see anything\u2019.\u201d\nAlso in Empord\u00e0, another mayor had a scare when traveling in the van loaded with referendum material. Two Civil Guard officers approached his vehicle: \u201cIt was the worst moment of his life,\u201d recalls a colleague. \u201cIn the end, they just asked him how to get to another town and they did not even see what he was carrying. They were just lost and didn\u2019t know the area.\u201d\nEnglish version by Debora Almeida .\nMore information Solved: the mystery of the missing Catalan ballot boxes Predictable but still a source of disbelief Did the referendum comply with basic voting regulations?

Which is what I aim to do here as briefly as possible.\nPolice in Catalonia were not acting on the orders of the central government but of the judiciary\nThe first thing to take into account is that the police were not acting on the orders of the central government but of the judiciary. The police were preventing an independence referendum from taking place on the orders of a judge because it was decided that it violated the Constitution, which does not recognize the right of an autonomous region to take a unilateral decision to break away.\nIt\u2019s true that the words \u201cright to self-determination\u201d and \u201cright to decide\u201d sound reasonable in the kinds of modern democracy that exist in the US or Europe, but they have to be placed within each country\u2019s legal framework.\nRelated stories General strike in Catalonia to protest police violence during referendum Solved: the mystery of the missing Catalan ballot boxes Riot police operations called off early after outcry over violence The independence activists have been claiming the right to hold a referendum for years but the implications of such a measure have to be taken into account. The most serious one is that they would consider a \u2018yes\u2019 vote binding and that would affect all Catalans, even those who feel Spanish. How many Catalans feel Spanish? In the last elections, the Catalan pro-independence parties (the Junts pel S\u00ed coalition and the radical CUP party) got 1,975,348 votes out of a census of 5,510,798. In other words, of all the Catalans with the right to vote in Catalonia, 35% opted for one pro-independence party or another .\nOn several occasions, the independence activists have tried to hold a negotiated referendum such as in Scotland and Quebec. However, the dominant political parties in Spain have said no. The center-right Popular Party, which is currently in power in the central government, argues that a referendum on self-determination is illegal, among other things because Catalonia already is almost totally self-governing as it is.\nThe Catalans already manage their own prison system, their police, education and health. As far as the treasury is concerned, they control tax collection while the redistribution of public funds is controlled by the central government. Generally speaking, Catalonia is one of the most autonomous regions in the whole of Europe.\nThe other main party in Spain, the opposition Socialist Party (PSOE), believes that a referendum should be held involving all Spaniards, not just the Catalans. In other words, it believes that Congress should agree to reform the 1978 Constitution in a way that would turn the Spanish regional system into a federation of states and that this should be voted on nationally. Up to now, the PP has resisted putting this option to the Catalan leaders .\nIf Catalonia declared independence, Spain as we know it would cease to exist\nWhat is true is that if Catalonia declared independence, Spain as we know it would cease to exist, given that there are other regions such as the Basque Country and Galicia with powerful nationalist movements that would probably follow their lead.\nAlso to be taken into account is the systematic persecution of both major parties by the terrorist organization ETA that killed 829 people \u2013 including numerous teachers, politicians and policemen \u2013 in the name of Basque nationalism from 1958, when Franco was still in power, until 2010.\nCatalonia has never been an independent state. It was part of the Kingdom of Aragon when Aragon joined the Kingdom of Castile in the 15th century. It shares a language and culture with other autonomous regions \u2013 Valencia and the Balearic Islands. Many pro-independence leaders propose that these other regions should join Catalonia to make the \u2018 Pa\u00efsos Catalans ,\u2019 something unlikely to happen given that these other regions feel strongly Spanish.\nFaced with the refusal of PP and the Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, to entertain a referendum in Catalonia, in August the independence activists passed a law enabling them to hold the vote unilaterally and another in which the process of proclaiming a republic is laid out in detail. In this vote, the parties opposing independence, which hold 63 of the 135 seats, abstained from voting and the central government put the matter in the hands of the Constitutional Court, which ordered the police to prevent the referendum from going ahead.\nCatalonia\u2019s leaders left the referendum in the hands of the general population, who had to face the police response alone\nThe central government could have resorted to Article 155 in the Constitution , which allows it to assume the powers of the Catalan regional government in the event it is disobeyed. But it didn\u2019t.\nVarious warnings were issued in the run-up to the referendum appealing to the pro-independence leaders to call it off. They were called to order by the central government, the socialist opposition and even by US President Donald Trump as well as the president of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker. All the above expressed respect for the law and the Spanish Constitution.\nDespite this, Catalan leaders decided to press on with their agenda. They said the vote would take place. They published the census on internet . They chose the schools that would act as polling stations. They allowed groups of volunteers to conceal the ballot boxes and organize the vote . Various pro-independence voters organized pajama parties with children in the schools in order to occupy them.\nIn short, Catalonia\u2019s leaders left the referendum in the hands of the general population, who had to face the police response alone. What could be better for these pro independence leaders than images of unrest and policemen seizing ballot boxes by force, which is exactly what happened?\nEL PA\u00cdS stands with the Constitution and proposes returning to the letter of the law to solve the current crisis\nCatalonia has its own police force, the Mossos de Esquadra, which is now under investigation for disobedience. It was under the orders of the Constitutional Court to vacate the schools \u2013 to go to each school and make sure the vote didn\u2019t take place. The heads of the Mossos de Esquadra claimed they did that, but the footage from Sunday shows a different story. They turned up at the schools, handed over a piece of paper and left.\nWhich is why the National Police and Civil Guard were sent in, only to be met by human barricades, a number of which were broken up by force.\nArmed with the resulting images, the pro-independence leaders have maintained that there were almost 900 injured and are requesting the EU and the UN to intervene against Spanish authoritarianism . According to Jordi S\u00e0nchez, President of the National Catalan Assembly (ANC): \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been this number of injuries since the Second World War.\u201d\nWhat actually happened was that the local health services tended to 893 people, most of whom had suffered a panic attack or a minor injury of some kind. So the figure was exaggerated. There was only one serious hospital case and that was due to a heart attack. Another was admitted to hospital with an eye injury. According to the Spanish government, 33 policemen were injured in the course of duty.\nIt is untrue, as the Catalan leaders claim, that this is the worst violence in Europe for decades. There are some very recent examples that are far worse, such as the crackdown on crowds protesting against the G20 summit in Hamburg last May when hundreds were injured by police using tear gas and water cannons. In France, 2005, three civilians died and almost a thousand were injured in clashes with the police; not to mention the repressive measures employed by various governments, such as the one in Hungary, acting against immigrants trying to cross their country to get to Germany.\nIt\u2019s important to add that the party that now leads the pro-independence coalition has been in power for decades in Catalonia and, according to recent findings, is guilty of setting up illegal funding systems via illegal commissions of 3% on public projects. Many of their leaders, including the former president, Jordi Pujol , are either under investigation or already in prison.\nEL PA\u00cdS is a newspaper that emerged after the death of the dictator Franco. It spoke of the need to defend a constitutional democracy in Spain. During the attempted coup in 1981 while tanks were crawling up the streets and the military police in control of Congress, its front page read: \u201cEL PA\u00cdS stands with the Constitution.\u201d Now EL PA\u00cdS still stands with the Constitution and proposes returning to the letter of the law to solve the current crisis. Let the various political parties agree on an amendment to the constitution that is voted on by the country as a whole so that people have the right to decide in a free, equal and democratic manner.\nEnglish version by Heather Galloway .\nMore information Editorial | In the face of Catalan insurrection, the law but not just the law V\u00eddeos Newsletters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sant julia de ramis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariano rajoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galicia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aragon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordi s\u00e0nchez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean claude juncker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather galloway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david ramos getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordi pujol", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "popular party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constitutional court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national police and civil guard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mossos de esquadra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "compartir en facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "socialist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el pa\u00eds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national catalan assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdom of aragon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balearic islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdom of castile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "basque country", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valencia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:45:42.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5d9a8f19a14723048085856e142506f9a642870", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB9hPv_zoqvtZ70ecnRDiQCv4EaDvlaQOMNo7wYCAkg8vI.ab2aKxV_C", "site_full": "elpais.com", "site": "elpais.com", "site_section": "http://ep00.epimg.net/rss/tags/o_video.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Todos los v\u00eddeos de EL PA\u00cdS", "title": "Should Piqu\u00e9 leave the Spain squad?", "title_full": "Should Piqu\u00e9 leave the Spain squad?", "published": "2017-10-03T18:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ep00.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2017/10/03/inenglish/1507040291_767190_1507040483_rrss_normal.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 485, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 278, "comments": 0, "shares": 278}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5d9a8f19a14723048085856e142506f9a642870", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB9hPv_zoqvtZ70ecnRDiQCv4EaDvlaQOMNo7wYCAkg8vI.ab2aKxV_C", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Diego Torres, El Pa\u00eds", "published": "2017-10-03T18:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should Piqu\u00e9 leave the Spain squad?", "text": "A storm is brewing in Spain around FC Barcelona player and national soccer team member Gerard Piqu\u00e9, after he openly defended the independence referendum that was held on Sunday in Catalonia.\nNow, a day after angry fans booed Piqu\u00e9 at a Spain training session in Las Rozas (Madrid), government spokesman and Sports Minister \u00cd\u00f1igo M\u00e9ndez de Vigo has decided to join the fray with public statements of his own.\nGerard Piqu\u00e9 with the Spain team in Liechtenstein.

In these circumstances, I wish to address all Spaniards. We have all witnessed the events that have taken place in Catalonia, with the illegal declaration of independence as the final goal of the Catalan executive [Generalitat].\nM\u00c1S INFORMACI\u00d3N Centenares de polic\u00edas protestan en todo el pa\u00eds en solidaridad con sus compa\u00f1eros en Catalu\u00f1a El Gobierno denuncia \u201ccomportamientos mafiosos\u201d en Catalu\u00f1a contra la Polic\u00eda y la Guardia Civil For a long time, certain Catalan authorities have repeatedly, consciously and deliberately flouted the Constitution and their own Statute of Autonomy, which is the law that acknowledges, protects and safeguards their historic institutions and their self-government.\nWith their decisions, they have systematically infringed legally and rightfully approved rules and have shown an unacceptable disloyalty towards the institutions of the State \u2013 a State of which, by the way, those authorities are the highest representatives in Catalonia.\nThey have violated the democratic principles of the rule of law and they have undermined Catalan society\u2019s harmony and coexistence, unfortunately even to the point of driving a wedge within it. Today, Catalan society is fractured and at loggerheads.\nThe Catalan authorities have underestimated the affections and feelings of solidarity that have united and will long unite the Spaniards, and with their reckless behavior, they may be even endangering the economic and social stability of Catalonia and of Spain as a whole.\nIn short, this has been the completion of an unacceptable attempt to take over the historic institutions of Catalonia. Those authorities have unequivocally and categorically placed themselves outside the law and outside democracy. They have tried to break Spain\u2019s unity and national sovereignty, which is the right of all Spanish people to democratically decide on their life together.\nTherefore, and in light of this extremely serious situation, that requires everyone\u2019s commitment to pursue common interests, the legitimate powers of the state have the responsibility to guarantee constitutional order and the normal functioning of the institutions, the validity of the rule of law and Catalonia\u2019s self-government, based on the Constitution and their own Statute of Autonomy.\nToday I wish to send several messages to all Spaniards and in particular to Catalans. To the citizens of Catalonia \u2013 to all of them \u2013 I wish to reiterate that we have been already been living for several decades in a democratic State, which provides constitutional means for anyone to defend their ideas within the law. Because, as we all know, without respect for the law, there is no possible democratic coexistence in peace and freedom, neither in Catalonia, nor in the rest of Spain, nor anywhere in the world. In a democratic and constitutional Spain, they know that they have space to coexist and get along with all their fellow citizens.\nI am well aware that in Catalonia there is also great concern and anxiety about the Catalan authorities\u2019 behavior. To those who feel that way, I assure that they are not, nor will they be, alone; they have all the support and the solidarity of the rest of the Spanish people, as well as the absolute guarantee given by the rule of law in the defense of their freedom and their rights.\nTo all Spaniards, who are living through these events full of sadness and distress, I send a message of calm, confidence and hope.\nThese are troubled times, but we will overcome them. These are very complicated times, but we will get through them. Because we believe in our country and we are proud of what we are. Because our democratic principles are solid and strong. And they are like this because they are based on the wishes of millions and millions of Spaniards who want a peaceful and free coexistence. That is how we have gradually built Spain in these last decades. And that is how we must go forward, with serenity and determination. On this road, in that improved Spain that we all desire, Catalonia will be there too.\nLet me end these words, addressed to all Spaniards, by emphasizing once again the Crown\u2019s firm commitment to the Constitution and to democracy, my own dedication to a climate of understanding and harmony among Spaniards, and my commitment, as king, to the unity and continuity of Spain.\u201d\nEnglish version by Mar\u00eda Luisa Rodr\u00edguez Tapia .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://es.linkedin.com/in/mar%C3%ADa-luisa-rodr%C3%ADguez-tapia-6b116236", "https://ep01.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2017/10/03/inenglish/1507063595_266495_1507064064_sumarioapoyo_normal.jpg", "https://ep01.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2017/10/03/inenglish/1507063595_266495_1507064113_sumarioapoyo_normal.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "felipe vi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mar\u00eda luisa rodr\u00edguez tapia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "catalu\u00f1a el gobierno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de octubre felipe vi autodeterminaci\u00f3n generalitat catalu\u00f1a catalu\u00f1a refer\u00e9ndum familia real jefe de estado conflictos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "refer\u00e9ndum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elecciones gobierno auton\u00f3mico casa real pol\u00edtica", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T10:38:50.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9250ae7de4792e866d617a6069f5831182abf298", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB9hPv_zoqvtZ70ecnRDiQCv17eHqzpf4H8nZi4y0zaNeXLI48chCia0", "site_full": "elpais.com", "site": "elpais.com", "site_section": "https://elpais.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "EL PA\u00cdS: el peri\u00f3dico global", "title": "King Felipe VI addresses the nation | In English", "title_full": "King Felipe VI addresses the nation | In English | EL PA\u00cdS", "published": "2017-10-04T10:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 28, "participants_count": 22, "site_type": "news", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ep00.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2017/10/03/inenglish/1507063595_266495_1507063711_rrss_normal.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 485, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "714444351fa30d152778eb807db0f07db9a95748", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB9hPv_zoqvtZ70ecnRDiQCv17eHqzpf4H8nZi4y0zaNefOLehKwh_xU_Xayer.653Y-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "ciatro", "published": "2017-10-04T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "Philip VI, no II.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T10:38:50.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9250ae7de4792e866d617a6069f5831182abf298", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB9hPv_zoqvtZ70ecnRDiQCv17eHqzpf4H8nZi4y0zaNeXLI48chCia0", "site_full": "elpais.com", "site": "elpais.com", "site_section": "https://elpais.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "EL PA\u00cdS: el peri\u00f3dico global", "title": "King Felipe VI addresses the nation | In English", "title_full": "King Felipe VI addresses the nation | In English | EL PA\u00cdS", "published": "2017-10-04T10:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 28, "participants_count": 22, "site_type": "news", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ep00.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2017/10/03/inenglish/1507063595_266495_1507063711_rrss_normal.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 485, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee4edadb2663141ccb10f8af1b6567a74d026a1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB9hPv_zoqvtZ70ecnRDiQCv17eHqzpf4H8nZi4y0zaNefOLehKwh_xUDaUq.ANuxGI-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "phantomnyc", "published": "2017-10-04T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "First , this is King Philip VI, number II died in the 1598.

Although Bloomberg was quick to name her only child Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt-Meyers, 64, as her successor, it all depends on how Liliane\u2019s assets are divided up.\nOf the world\u2019s 2,043 billionaires, just 227 are women\nThe Bettencourt fortune consists of a 33.05% stake in the L\u2019Oreal group, managed by the holding company Tethys, according to French daily Le Monde . The same paper claims that, in 1992, Liliane drew up a will, leaving two-thirds of her fortune to her daughter and a third to her two grandsons, but Bloomberg\u2019s obituary credits Fran\u00e7oise as the sole recipient of her mother\u2019s $42.5 billion estate.\nIf there were a division of the Bettencourt spoils, it would make Alice Walton the world\u2019s richest woman. But, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index, Walton is worth $37.8 billion and lags at 18th place behind Bettencourt-Meyers\u2019 15th place in the combined male and female rich list.\nOf the worlds 2,043 billionaires , just 227 are women. Alice Walton may be America\u2019s richest woman but her brothers Rob and Jim, who stand at 16 and 17 in the rankings respectively, beat her on the rich list. The offspring of Walmart founder Sam Walton are collectively managing a fortune worth $130 billion, 12 times more than the Rockefellers.\nAlice Walton caused controversy by backing Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign\nDespite her eye-watering wealth, Alice leads a relatively low-key life, though she is far from anonymous in the art world. In 2011, she plowed $50 million into the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, to house her private art collection worth $500 million, according to Business Insider . And during the last presidential elections, she caused controversy by backing Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign with a donation of $353,400.\nOther contenders for the \u201cworld\u2019s wealthiest woman\u201d title are Mars heiress Jacqueline Mars, who is worth $32.4 billion and ranks 24th overall on Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index, while BMW heiress Susanne Klatten ranks 37 with $22.1 billion.

This much has become evident following Monday meetings between Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and the leaders of both opposition parties.\nIf anybody has a proposal, let them say so now, because there\u2019s 72 hours left before the Catalan government declares independence\nCiudadanos leader Albert Rivera\nWhat emerged from the meetings is that Spain\u2019s pro-Constitution parties have no common solution for addressing the next steps that will predictably be taken by Catalonia\u2019s separatist government, which has announced a unilateral declaration of independence in the coming days.\nMeanwhile, the anti-establishment Podemos is defending a legal referendum for the region and is openly hostile to Rajoy, making an agreement unlikely.\nPSOE: let\u2019s talk At their meeting, Socialist secretary general Pedro S\u00e1nchez asked Rajoy to open up an \u201cimmediate\u201d political negotiation with Catalan authorities, and also to initiate talks with all of Spain\u2019s parliamentary forces \u2013 including Podemos \u2013 to find a way out of the Catalan crisis.\n\u201cThe secretary general of the Socialists has told Rajoy to re-establish contact and open up immediate negotiations with the head of the Generalitat [Carles Puigdemont] to establish a dialogue that is more necessary than ever today,\u201d said the statement.\nBut constructive talks between the PP and Unidos Podemos, Spain\u2019s third-largest presence in Congress, are unlikely. The latter has been highly critical of the conservative government\u2019s handling of the secessionist challenge , and its leader Pablo Iglesias has asked S\u00e1nchez to work with Podemos instead to create a government of change that will push Rajoy out of office.\nCiudadanos leader Albert Rivera after his meeting with Mariano Rajoy on Monday. Luca Piergiovanni EFE Meanwhile, reform party Ciudadanos \u2013 which began life as a Catalan anti-independence party before making the jump to national politics and becoming the fourth-most-voted force in Spain \u2013 is asking Rajoy to invoke Section 155 , a provision of the Spanish Constitution that could theoretically suspend home rule in Catalonia by \u201cforcing\u201d the region to comply with constitutional law.\n\u201cIf anybody has a proposal, let them say so now, because there\u2019s 72 hours left before [the Catalan government] declare independence, and that\u2019s something that cannot be stopped with a registered fax from the Constitutional Court,\u201d said Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera, alluding to the fact that most action against the referendum has so far been left in the hands of the judiciary.\nRajoy: let\u2019s wait The Spanish PM does not want to make any moves before knowing what Catalonia\u2019s Puigdemont and his partners will do first. He did not tell S\u00e1nchez or Rivera about his plans , although he did concede to the latter that all options are on the table, including the possibility of invoking 155.\nRajoy wants to appear before Congress to explain what he intends to do to uphold the rule of law in Spain, something that is not likely to happen before next week.\nMafia-like behavior On Tuesday, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido held an emergency meeting with the heads of the National Police and Civil Guard to analyze possible measures against \u201cthe intolerable harassment\u201d suffered by law enforcement officers at the hands of secessionist activists in Catalonia.\nThe government is investigating reports that hotels in several locations were pressured by local authorities into throwing out law enforcement members who were staying at their establishments, or face closure.\n\u201cThis is mafia-like behavior, and we will not tolerate mafia-like behavior from town halls in Catalonia,\u201d said Deputy Prime Minister Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda on Tuesday.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra .\nMore information Solved: the mystery of the missing Catalan ballot boxes Predictable, but still a source of disbelief There\u2019s fake news in Catalonia too Riot police operations called off early after outcry over violence in Catalonia V\u00eddeos Newsletters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "soraya s\u00e1enz de santamar\u00eda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariano rajoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carles puigdemont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juan ignacio zoido", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert rivera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pablo iglesias", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rivera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susana urra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro s\u00e1nchez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luca piergiovanni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s\u00e1nchez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "popular party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constitutional court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national police and civil guard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unidos podemos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "efe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "socialist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "socialists", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "socialist party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psoe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ciudadanos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la moncloa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T10:54:13.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22bb403b6ab90b3592554771c5047a8e9f900e58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB9hPv_zoqvtZ70ecnRDiQCvGVM.caYwrfcM10S51MsgfrOVn8m5ADpz", "site_full": "elpais.com", "site": "elpais.com", "site_section": "http://ep01.epimg.net/rss/elpais/inenglish.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "In English Section | EL PA\u00cdS", "title": "Using Europe in vain", "title_full": "Using Europe in vain", "published": "2017-10-03T14:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ep00.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2017/10/03/inenglish/1507023460_424892_1507028956_rrss_normal.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 485, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 43, "comments": 0, "shares": 43}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 9}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22bb403b6ab90b3592554771c5047a8e9f900e58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB9hPv_zoqvtZ70ecnRDiQCvGVM.caYwrfcM10S51MsgfrOVn8m5ADpz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "El Pa\u00eds", "published": "2017-10-03T14:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Using Europe in vain", "text": "The Catalan executive, or Generalitat, has called for European mediation to resolve, in favor of independence for the region (with the excuses of the right to decide or police action on Sunday ), its showdown with Spanish rule of law .\nAnd soon the Generalitat will make the same request of other international organizations, hoping to achieve abroad \u2013 brandishing impressive and sad images \u2013 what it has failed to do at home, through political persuasion.\nThe petition to the EU is opportunistic in its formulation; it is clear that the plan is mere propaganda\nIt is an untimely call because this mediation doesn\u2019t fit within the framework of the European Union\u2019s Treaty of Lisbon, article four of which obliges all signatories to respect the territorial integrity and Constitution of all member states. And the call is cynical because the alliance that props up the Catalan government oscillates between indifference and hostility toward the EU.\nThe pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) party, one of the coalition partners in the Catalan government, carried out an aggressive campaign against the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which later became the Treaty of Lisbon, because it understood \u2013 correctly \u2013 that the document did not include the right to secession. Catalonia\u2019s Converg\u00e8ncia party (now the Catalan European Democratic Party, or PDeCAT) came close to holding the same position, causing a considerable crisis among its most pro-European elements.\nAnd the far-left CUP party has renounced Europe , which it sees as the ultimate expression of capitalist neoliberalism and whose flag it happily burns in the streets.\nThe alliance that props up the Catalan government oscillates between indifference and hostility toward the EU\nThe fraudulent character of the secessionist project is evidenced in the fact that it is asking for Europe\u2019s help in a cause whose final aim is the fragmentation of the state \u2013 in other words, a goal that is completely contrary to the foundational philosophy of the EU, which postulates the overcoming of the demons that exclusionary nationalism have always brought to Europe.\nThe secessionists are also calling for this mediation so that they can have a dialogue that is in fact an ultimatum because they pose, as an inalienable prerequisite, the acceptance of a false right to vote on secession, or an immediate recognition of independence.\nThe petition to the EU is also opportunistic in its formulation. It is already clear that the plan is mere propaganda. It seeks to characterize Spanish democracy as a democratically nonviable state with the aim of creating an alibi for a \u201cremedial\u201d secession that would provide relief from the excesses of a (non-existent) dictatorship.\nThis won\u2019t be the case, as the European Commission repeated yesterday, because the EU is obliged to respect the territorial integrity of member states and their respective constitutions, and because, as a consequence, the solution to a dispute must always be found within the legal framework of Spain.\nThe mediation called for by the Generalitat doesn\u2019t fit within the framework of the European Union\u2019s Treaty of Lisbon\nThe government of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy must now employ all of its efforts toward solving the dispute after having squandered all opportunities to oppose the machinery of secessionist propaganda. Its absence at the recent EU summit in Tallinn, where it should have explained its reasons in terms of Spanish rule of law, is the perfect symbol of its absence in general.\nEnglish version by George Mills .\nMore information General strike in Catalonia to protest police violence during referendum Solved: the mystery of the missing Catalan ballot boxes The 15 most-shared photos of the referendum In the face of Catalan insurrection, the law but not just the law V\u00eddeos Newsletters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "massi", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mariano rajoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george mills", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "barcelona city hall", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalan european democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisbon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tallinn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T10:54:20.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2cba05f2b6b1ac4b6ab17647ff4080426467f181", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB.1mgl5fDRzsIKAZWP8O69gm6XBfEsVv_geTFLx5LBQCrPshExyocQa", "site_full": "elpais.com", "site": "elpais.com", "site_section": "http://ep01.epimg.net/rss/elpais/inenglish.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "In English Section | EL PA\u00cdS", "title": "King Felipe VI makes rare address to the nation as Catalan crisis deepens", "title_full": "King Felipe VI makes rare address to the nation as Catalan crisis deepens", "published": "2017-10-04T10:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ep00.epimg.net/elpais/imagenes/2017/10/03/inenglish/1507063595_266495_1507063711_rrss_normal.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 485, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 379, "comments": 0, "shares": 379}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2cba05f2b6b1ac4b6ab17647ff4080426467f181", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB.1mgl5fDRzsIKAZWP8O69gm6XBfEsVv_geTFLx5LBQCrPshExyocQa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "El Pa\u00eds, Miquel Alberola", "published": "2017-10-04T10:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "King Felipe VI makes rare address to the nation as Catalan crisis deepens", "text": "On Tuesday evening Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI spoke to the nation on the issue of the Catalan crisis . In his message, broadcast on national television, he made a firm defense of the Spanish Constitution in the face of the separatist challenge in Catalonia \u2013 what he described as an \u201cextremely serious situation.\u201d\nSpeaking in a somber tone and dressed in a black suit, King Felipe said that \u201ccertain Catalan authorities have repeatedly, consciously and deliberately flouted the Constitution and their own Statute of Autonomy [Estatut], which is the law that acknowledges, protects and safeguards their historic institutions and their self-government.\u201d\nThe monarch accused the Catalan government of jeopardizing the social and economic stability of Catalonia and Spain\nIn his speech, the monarch accused the Catalan government and parliament of \u201cirresponsible behavior\u201d that threatened to jeopardize the social and economic stability of Catalonia and Spain.\n\u201cThese authorities have unequivocally and categorically placed themselves outside the law and outside democracy,\u201d said King Felipe, without referring directly to Catalan Premier Carles Puigdemont or the speaker of the Catalan regional parliament, Carme Forcadell, by name.\nThe monarch also included a special message for Catalans: \u201cI wish to reiterate that we have been living for several decades already in a democratic State, one that provides constitutional ways for anyone to defend their ideas within the law,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThese are troubled times, but we will overcome them,\u201d he said, ending his message on a positive note. But he warned that \u201cwithout respect for the law, there is no possible democratic coexistence in peace and freedom, neither in Catalonia, nor in the rest of Spain, nor anywhere in the world.\u201d\nThese are troubled times, but we will overcome them\nKing Felipe VI\nKing Felipe\u2019s speech came on the evening of a day in which thousands of Catalans marched on the streets to protest National Police and Civil Guard action during Sunday\u2019s illegal referendum in the region after almost 850 people ended up needing medical attention as ugly scenes played out \u2013 scenes that were beamed around the world \u2013 between the authorities and members of the public.\nData from Sunday\u2019s poll shows around 90% of voters cast their ballots in favor of independence. However, participation was just 2,262,424 of a total voter pool of 5,343,358, for a turnout rate of 42%, according to the Catalan government\u2019s own figures. The abstention rate was 58%.\nFull text of King Felipe\u2019s speech \u201cGood evening,\nWe find ourselves at a critical juncture for our existence as a democracy. In these circumstances, I wish to address all Spaniards. We have all witnessed the events that have taken place in Catalonia, with the illegal declaration of independence as the final goal of the Catalan executive [Generalitat].\nFor a long time, certain Catalan authorities have repeatedly, consciously and deliberately flouted the Constitution and their own Statute of Autonomy, which is the law that acknowledges, protects and safeguards their historic institutions and their self-government.\nWith their decisions, they have systematically infringed legally and rightfully approved rules and have shown an unacceptable disloyalty towards the institutions of the State \u2013 a State of which, by the way, those authorities are the highest representatives in Catalonia.\nThey have violated the democratic principles of the rule of law and they have undermined Catalan society\u2019s harmony and coexistence, unfortunately even to the point of driving a wedge within it. Today, Catalan society is fractured and at loggerheads.\nThe Catalan authorities have underestimated the affections and feelings of solidarity that have united and will long unite the Spaniards, and with their reckless behavior, they may be even endangering the economic and social stability of Catalonia and of Spain as a whole.\nIn short, this has been the completion of an unacceptable attempt to take over the historic institutions of Catalonia. Those authorities have unequivocally and categorically placed themselves outside the law and outside democracy. They have tried to break Spain\u2019s unity and national sovereignty, which is the right of all Spanish people to democratically decide on their life together.\nTherefore, and in light of this extremely serious situation, that requires everyone\u2019s commitment to pursue common interests, the legitimate powers of the state have the responsibility to guarantee constitutional order and the normal functioning of the institutions, the validity of the rule of law and Catalonia\u2019s self-government, based on the Constitution and their own Statute of Autonomy.\nToday I wish to send several messages to all Spaniards and in particular to Catalans. To the citizens of Catalonia \u2013 to all of them \u2013 I wish to reiterate that we have been already been living for several decades in a democratic State, which provides constitutional means for anyone to defend their ideas within the law. Because, as we all know, without respect for the law, there is no possible democratic coexistence in peace and freedom, neither in Catalonia, nor in the rest of Spain, nor anywhere in the world. In a democratic and constitutional Spain, they know that they have space to coexist and get along with all their fellow citizens.\nI am well aware that in Catalonia there is also great concern and anxiety about the Catalan authorities\u2019 behavior. To those who feel that way, I assure that they are not, nor will they be, alone; they have all the support and the solidarity of the rest of the Spanish people, as well as the absolute guarantee given by the rule of law in the defense of their freedom and their rights.\nTo all Spaniards, who are living through these events full of sadness and distress, I send a message of calm, confidence and hope.\nThese are troubled times, but we will overcome them. These are very complicated times, but we will get through them. Because we believe in our country and we are proud of what we are. Because our democratic principles are solid and strong. And they are like this because they are based on the wishes of millions and millions of Spaniards who want a peaceful and free coexistence. That is how we have gradually built Spain in these last decades. And that is how we must go forward, with serenity and determination. On this road, in that improved Spain that we all desire, Catalonia will be there too.\nLet me end these words, addressed to all Spaniards, by emphasizing once again the Crown\u2019s firm commitment to the Constitution and to democracy, my own dedication to a climate of understanding and harmony among Spaniards, and my commitment, as king, to the unity and continuity of Spain.\u201d\nEnglish version

The mass mobilization combined elements of a secessionist strike with youthful protests over police action on Sunday \u2013 with resulting scenes of intimidation, turmoil and chaos that perfectly illustrate the magnitude of the crisis currently gripping Spain.\nThe truly alarming thing about yesterday\u2019s events is that they evidenced the extent to which the Catalan government is acting like a committee of professional agitators, like an agent of insurgency, like an anti-institution: in short, like an apparatus that works against the liberal system, making the most of the advantages and privileges granted by the democratic institutions in order to consummate a serialized coup d\u2019\u00e9tat .\nIt is cause for surprise, and embarrassment, that the Catalan chaos is going to be discussed in the European Parliament before it is addressed in Spain\u2019s own Congress\nRegional premier Carles Puigdemont, his deputy Oriol Junqueras, and their entire governing team (including the rare few department heads who supposedly oppose their boss\u2019s plans, but who remain strictly silent about it in public) are responsible for the public disorder and the break with the law \u2013 and they must be held responsible before the relevant political and judicial bodies. They called on citizens to vote in a ballot that lacked the necessary legal guarantees and entailed a personal safety risk . They organized the illegal event in partnership with civil associations (ANC, \u00d2mnium) which they themselves funded, using clandestine techniques of urban geography control more typical of other parts of the world. Neither the use of force nor the praise which may come from some quarters can ever turn their irregular, fraudulent consultation into a valid referendum.\nThe Catalan government \u2013 the Generalitat \u2013 conspired with unions to call a general strike for the benefit of secessionist forces; it was a siren call that was fortunately avoided. The Generalitat has furthermore organized episodes of harassment against Spanish police officers to force them to leave Catalonia. The Generalitat has also organized a strike of its own government workers, concealed (they always need to use a mask) behind a deceitful description: \u201cgeneral stoppage.\u201d And with the aggravating factor that besides being mandatory, this strike comes for free, as it does not entail salary reductions. This is an evident instance of squandering (or embezzling) public funds.\nFor all of these reasons, the Catalan government is not acting, as it should, like a government of Catalonia: it is acting against the interests of all Catalans, against their physical and legal safety, against their freedom of movement, against the honest administration of their taxes, against their financial assets, and those of their banks and businesses. And if they persist, they will be acting against everyone\u2019s well-being and income \u2013 whether high, middle or low \u2013 of everyone, as their image continues to deteriorate in the eyes of the markets.\nThis is not, then, a government that works for Catalans, but against them.\nThis is about reinforcing the beliefs of a majority of Catalans who want to increase their prosperity and self-government within our common home that is Spain\nSuch is the dramatic depth of the situation, and there are just two ways to act. On one hand, to keep defending the law, using all legal means available, until constitutional and statutory order are fully restored: until the Catalan government stops acting like a picket line, the regional police stop acting like a group of butlers, and the supreme norms of democratic coexistence that were entrusted to the regional parliament are fully restored.\nOn the other hand, there is greater urgency than ever for the government and Spain\u2019s democratic forces, including moderate Basque nationalists, to forge a common response, a proposal, an offer for the Catalans, a project that they might be interested in and get excited about.\nThis in no way represents a strategy of appeasement of radical secessionists. That would be impossible, as there is little to discuss with those who say they are willing to talk, but only to talk about breaking, never about rebuilding, and who are disinclined to stray away from the criminal path they have embarked on.\nOn the contrary, this is about reinforcing the beliefs of a majority of Catalans who want to increase their own prosperity and self-government within our common home that is Spain. This is about welcoming back those who have thrown themselves into the arms of secessionists as the (tactical) lesser of two evils, given the deaf ears, passive attitude and lack of progress emanating from Madrid.\nThe truly alarming thing about Tuesday\u2019s events is they evidenced the extent to which the Catalan government is acting like a committee of professional agitators\nIt is cause for surprise, and embarrassment, that the Catalan chaos is going to be discussed in the European Parliament before it is addressed in Spain\u2019s own Congress. It would be worrisome if the leaders of the three Spanish parties most deeply committed to defending the constitutional order were unable to formulate common workable ideas \u2013 not ideas to negotiate with those who don\u2019t want to negotiate anything other than details regarding their own breakaway process; we mean ideas to entice Catalan citizens with a powerful offer \u2013 an offer that is generous, ambitious, attractive, incontestable, and which could later be negotiated, encoded in a pact and ratified \u2013 how else? \u2013 through a legal referendum with all due guarantees.

There were, for example, more serious injuries in riots and protests against the G20 in Hamburg this past May. Not to mention the wars in the former Yugoslavia or the riots in Ukraine in 2014 and 2015.\nSo how many people were really injured in Catalonia on October 1? Are injured people the same as those who receive medical attention?\nMostly what was attended to were bruises, dizziness and anxiety attacks\nCatalan health department\nThere is no doubt that there were injuries as a result of the National Police and the Civil Guard\u2019s actions. The pictures prove it. But according to Doctors Without Borders, which cites international humanitarian law, the injured are \u201cpeople in uniform or civilians who need medical attention because they are suffering from trauma, illness, or other physical or mental disorder.\u201d It is important to turn to international legal organizations and frameworks for definitions, now that the secessionists are appealing to the same sources to definitively break with the rest of the country.\nIs it possible that these 893 people were suffering from trauma or illness? On several occasions throughout Sunday, the official Twitter account for the Catalan Health Department reported that \u201cmostly what was attended to were bruises, dizzy spells and anxiety attacks.\u201d\nOn Monday, the Catalan health service issued several documents in Catalan, French, and English admitting that the figure of 893 represents people \u201cwho have been seen by doctors.\u201d It\u2019s clear that just because someone sees a doctor, it does not mean that they are hurt or sick.\nIn total, four people were admitted into hospitals for treatment, two with minor conditions and two in serious condition. One man was hit by a rubber bullet in the eye, surely fired by the Civil Guard or the National Police, because the Catalan police do not use such equipment. The other is a man who suffered a heart attack during one of the police interventions.\nThere were more than 700 people injured, people who went to cast a vote , not to rob a bank!\nPep Guardiola, the Manchester City soccer team coach\nOn Tuesday, a woman claimed the police had broken several of her fingers. Her story led Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City soccer team coach , to speak out: \u201cThey broke one woman\u2019s fingers. There were more than 700 people injured, people who went to cast a vote , not to rob a bank!\u201d The broken fingers turned out to be inflammation in one finger, as she herself has since admitted. Doctors have prescribed three days of rest.\nCertainly, there are people who had to receive treatment for injuries, but the Catalan government\u2019s information is ambiguous.

Not out of embarrassment, but out of rage. Two individuals with esteladas [Catalan secessionist flags] wrapped around their necks started screaming at me outside my door this morning, calling me a \u201cfascist\u201d and yelling: \u201cYou should be ashamed!\u201d\nI had gone down to walk the dog and drop off some plastic containers for recycling, and because it was early and I was still half-asleep as I hadn\u2019t slept a wink the night before, at first I didn\u2019t even realize they were addressing me, so I went on my way.\nI never thought that speaking one\u2019s mind respectfully and honestly would come at such a high price\nThey continued to yell, so I turned around and calmly \u2013 even now, two hours later, I am still amazed at how calm I remained \u2013 said: \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed to talk to me this way if you don\u2019t even know me?\u201d They kept right on screaming. The dog was pulling on the leash. I walked away.\nI dropped off the recycling. I kept walking, still in shock. Slowly, a dull, unhealthy feeling of rage washed over me. For months now, even years if you count the day when I signed the Foro Babel Manifesto (which demanded true bilingualism in Catalonia ), both I and all other individuals who do not follow the single-track thinking of the pro-independence camp have been constant targets of insults for expressing our disagreement. But these last few months, the level of hatred aimed at us has reached new heights.\nUntil now, this harassment was limited to online lynching. I dealt with this by not having a Facebook or Twitter account (the latter was hacked, as was my WhatsApp profile, which was then used to send out a message that I did not write). Although there is always someone on hand to inform you about the tide of trash being piled on you in the social media. But this is the third time that they have yelled \u201cfascist\u201d at me so far this week (and the first time that I have answered back). And I find that something inside me is breaking.\nThese last few months, the level of hatred aimed at us is reaching new heights\nI see now, with horrifying clarity, that no matter what happens next, there is no room here for me or for anybody who dares to think independently, even though this is my place of birth. Today it is insults against me, yesterday it was insults against members of my family; the day before it was insults against friends of mine whose other friends openly criticize the fact that the former are still friends with me. And tomorrow, it will be something worse.\nIt makes no difference whether you unequivocally condemn police brutality , or whether you demand Rajoy\u2019s resignation (in my case, I have been asking for that since long before any of this happened).\nBecause if, when you condemn the Spanish government\u2019s actions, you don\u2019t also condone the Catalan government\u2019s actions , you immediately become an enemy, a fascist, a fascistoid , a Franco follower, the scum of the Earth. And you think about the fear that has already covered, like spores, the skin of all those people who keep quiet but who secretly come to tell you that they\u2019re on your side \u2013 that they are grateful for what you are doing, and then they tell you that they don\u2019t even talk about the situation inside their own homes, for fear that their children will hear them and get into trouble at school.\nThese are not mere anecdotes. This is the reality on the ground for those of us who live here. This is the new, shocking fracture of a society that used to live in peace and without fear, with logical differences of opinion and different values and different criteria, but always on a foundation of respect.\nI see now, with horrifying clarity, that no matter what happens next, there is no room here for me or for anybody who dares to think independently\nWhile I think about all this, I am starting to calm down. After all, these are minor issues compared to places in the world where there are men and women suffering all kinds of indignities, misfortunes and horrible humiliations. Mine is a First World problem. As I have often done in the past, I am trying to minimize what is happening to me in order to avoid feeding the monster of hate that would make me indistinguishable from those who now insult me.\nI never thought that speaking one\u2019s mind respectfully and honestly would come at such a high price. And yet I would not for the world trade this dry, silent no-man\u2019s land in which I find myself, which I know that many people find themselves in \u2013 a place without any chanting or screaming or slogans, where the air only blows against white flags that whisper the word \u201cHelp\u201d into the wind, in the vain hope that someone, somewhere, will listen before it is too late.\nIsabel Coixet is an internationally renowned, Barcelona-born movie director.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra .\nMore information Using Europe in vain What is really happening in Catalonia?

He tells you that he\u2019ll go, but he loses track of time so that when he is ready, the party is almost over. Or you maybe you work with a colleague who never sends reports through when you ask them to, and when you remind them, they play dumb. If you have lived through either of these situations, you already know about passive aggressive behavior, or silent treatment. We have all suffered through it and maybe even have been guilty of it ourselves. If such attitudes are the only way a person knows how to react, then they may be suffering from a disorder. But you don\u2019t need to go to such extremes to suffer the effects of so-called silent treatment in everyday life.\nIn fact, \u201csilent aggressiveness\u201d is far more common than we imagine. We find it at work, with our friends and, of course, in our relationships. It can be the result of several factors: self-esteem issues, feelings of abandonment in childhood \u2013 usually by the mother \u2013 and through learned behaviors. Both men and women experience this. Passive aggressive behaviors are difficult to recognize with the naked eye, but they are very painful to the person targeted and to themselves. Let\u2019s see how these people act to try and understand them.\nBehind this attitude there is pain, pride and fear that prevents people from expressing their real needs\nSilence is their main weapon A passive aggressive person gets angry like any other mortal, but will not verbalize it and instead expresses it in another way \u2013 that is, by ignoring the other person for long periods. Behind this attitude there is pain, with a mixture of pride and fear that prevents them from expressing their real needs. In this way, if a third party exposes the conflict to the light of day, they will refuse to speak of it. They will deny it, or pretend it does not exist.\nWith you but without you Passive aggressive people are highly dependent, even if they do not realize it. They like to be looked after, but at the same time, they want freedom and autonomy, and to not be given orders. That lends an often ambivalent and inconsistent character to what they say or to their expectations of other people.\nHidden aggression Their difficulty in expressing what they want and their dependence and anger when they do not feel wanted can be a ticking time bomb in personal relationships. It leads them to employ non-confrontational strategies: they do not speak, they do not pay attention to the other person, and they forget what they have been told\u2026 If the other person confronts their behavior, they will look for an easy way out of the discussion, through denial.\nVictim-hood in its pure state A passive aggressive person has a hard time recognizing what is happening to them and to others. Their lack of self-criticism and flexibility leads them to believe that they are right and the rest of the world is responsible for what is happening to them.\nWhat should we do about passive aggression? Use these three strategies. Firstly, recognize when the other person has fallen into that state and let it pass. If you need to argue or make them see that they are wrong, you are lost: passive aggressive people will close themselves off even more \u2013 so it is important to give it time. Their fear of abandonment will make them retreat at some point.\nPassive aggressive people will close themselves off even more if you argue with them\nSecond, give yourself space. Do not take someone\u2019s passive aggressiveness as a personal attack, but view it as a response to their pain mixed with difficulty in expressing it. Even if it hurts you, look at them with compassion.\nThe third strategy, to use \u2013 when the intensity of their behavior has lessened \u2013 is to reason with them calmly, without resorting to personal accusations. Explain what happens to you when they act that way. The aim is to find joint solutions. Logically, if this attitude occurs with great regularity, the best option is to seek professional help.\nIn short, silent aggression is very frequent and very painful. It is not necessary to have a disorder for it to manifest. As long as we know how to recognize this behavior in other people, or even in ourselves, we will know how to act with greater serenity and effectiveness.\nEnglish version by Debora Almeida .\nM\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n Four easy techniques to sharpen your memory Twelve key questions to determine the quality of your work environment How to best manage the six seconds that can change your life (for the worse) If we knew more science, we wouldn\u2019t judge people on their sexual orientation V\u00eddeos Newsletters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "debora almeida", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "v\u00eddeos newsletters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:43:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "170aebf815d80aab62256373201acf6c5a6310c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB.1mgl5fDRzsIKAZWP8O69gbY2ERxXTnQU.Tw9l0f7p2RTeJsEaCv2Z", "site_full": "elpais.com", "site": "elpais.com", "site_section": "http://ep01.epimg.net/rss/elpais/inenglish.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "In English Section | EL PA\u00cdS", "title": "Catalan independence to be proclaimed on Monday, says far-left CUP party", "title_full": "Catalan independence to be proclaimed on Monday, says far-left CUP party", "published": "2017-10-04T17:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ES", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ep00.epimg.net/ccaa/imagenes/2017/10/04/catalunya/1507106590_671255_1507108907_rrss_normal.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 485, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 325, "comments": 0, "shares": 325}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "170aebf815d80aab62256373201acf6c5a6310c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSf_v1_vn4l_bTghgFLYUupK_XgTFmFpB.1mgl5fDRzsIKAZWP8O69gbY2ERxXTnQU.Tw9l0f7p2RTeJsEaCv2Z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "\u00c0ngels Pi\u00f1ol, El Pa\u00eds", "published": "2017-10-04T17:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Catalan independence to be proclaimed on Monday, says far-left CUP party", "text": "An independent Catalan republic may be proclaimed as early as next Monday, according to members of CUP, the far-left party whose votes support the governing Junts pel S\u00ed (Together for Yes) coalition.\nBoth groups have filed a petition in the regional parliament to have Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont appear on Monday to provide an assessment of the independence referendum that was held on Sunday in violation of a Constitutional Court ban.
