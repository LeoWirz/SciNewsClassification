The Staff Association expresses a heartfelt thank you to Philippe for his unwavering commitment of 27 years! \nLet us begin with a few important dates that have marked his journey within the Staff Association: 1986: Philippe arrives at CERN and joins the Staff Association. Let us remind you that at the time joining the Staff Association was automatic and obligatory for all CERN staff members. 1994: Philippe stands in the elections and begins his first term as a staff delegate. Over time, Philippe discovers the different internal commissions of the Staff Association, including the Individual Cases Commission and the Commission on Legal Matters, as well as the official bodies of CERN, such as Restaurant Supervisory Committee (CSR). According to Philippe, \u201c It is a good thing to take part in several commissions and discover the work that they do\u2026 This way, everyone can find their place within the Staff Association \u201d. 1996: Philippe is invited to take part in the Executive Committee (CE) of the Staff Association (link). 1998 : Philippe joins the Steering Committee of the Nursery School as Treasurer. He held this position for a year, and was then appointed the President of the Committee, a position he held until 30 September 2017. \nPresidency of the EVEE Steering Committee \nChildren\u2019s Day-Care Centre and School (EVEE) of the CERN Staff Association, often called the Nursery School, is a private structure under Swiss law destined for children from 4 months to 6 years old. \nFor 18 years, as a perfect business manager, Philippe was responsible for the operation of the CERN Staff Association\u2019s Nursery School. \nSupported by the employer, the Staff Association, Philippe contributed significantly to the development of the Nursery School by increasing the services offered to families in response to their expectations. This led to the creation of: a canteen allowing children to eat on site at the structure in 2008; a cr\u00e8che for children from 4 months old in 2013; a month-long summer camp (every year in July) in 2015. \nAs the manager of the structure, Philippe wanted to implement the concertation process, as applied at CERN, also to the Steering Committee in the framework of discussions between employees and the employer. That is why this concertation Committee exists today. \n\u201c Concertation is important for us, delegates of the Association, and I am proud to say that in the past 18 years, the Children\u2019s Day-Care Centre and School has never been shaken by social movements. \u201d \nMoreover, inspired by the collective agreements in force in the Canton, Philippe always strived to ensure that the prevailing financial and social conditions in Geneva be applied to the structure. \nAnd yet, even though the management duties were exciting, it has not always been an easy task! \nIndeed: \u201c There are certain decisions that employers must take that are not easy. Since I had both my role as a CERN staff delegate and the management position the employer appointed me in, I was often torn between the wellbeing of the personnel and my role. It can easily feel like schizophrenia. Thankfully, there have been great moments, too\u2026 The best memory I have from my term is from the inauguration of the cr\u00e8che in 2013, where we got warm words from the then Director-General, Rolf Heuer, and the President of the Council, Professor Agnieszka Zalewska .\u201d \nWhen asked about his commitment to the Staff Association and the reasons why he became a delegate, Philippe told us: \u201c It is first and foremost a personal endeavour. If you want to be a delegate, you already have inspiration within you, something deeply altruistic. It is advisable to stay a long time to know the issues thoroughly. Go ahead, if you are fully confident but do not expect anything in return. Then again, you might just find personal fulfilment, professional networks, and friendship with all delegates .\u201d \nThe Staff Association would like to warmly thank Philippe for his commitment through all these years, for the EVEE structure and as a representative of the CERN personnel. \nPhilippe has left CERN at the end of September, and thus his career at CERN draws to a close. \nWe wish him all the best and every success in his new life! by", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "philippe", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "philippe trilhe", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "rolf heuer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agnieszka zalewska", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cern staff association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "individual cases commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "csr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cern staff association\u2019s nursery school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "restaurant supervisory committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "staff association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steering committee of the nursery school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nursery school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steering committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children\u2019s day-care centre and school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "executive committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evee steering committee  children\u2019s day-care centre and school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canton", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T19:00:29.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d50ee8f77c149c1fb79fbec6b45698a25613d148", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYuzcqk9T0flbcvHTV1a.eqcyhDg3YzynTJL_RrlwWm2AA--", "site_full": "jobs.web.cern.ch", "site": "cern.ch", "site_section": "https://ert.cern.ch/browse_www/wd_portal_rss.rss?p_hostname=ert.cern.ch", "site_categories": ["job_search", "jobs"], "section_title": "Careers at CERN RSS feed", "title": "Head of Soft Facilities Services SMB-SIS-2017-202-LD", "title_full": "Head of Soft Facilities Services SMB-SIS-2017-202-LD", "published": "2017-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15765, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d50ee8f77c149c1fb79fbec6b45698a25613d148", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYuzcqk9T0flbcvHTV1a.eqcyhDg3YzynTJL_RrlwWm2AA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Head of Soft Facilities Services SMB-SIS-2017-202-LD", "text": "The behavioural competencies required for this post are: Creating vision and strategic partnerships: build comprehensive road maps to translate the organisational vision to an operational level; defines and sets direction accordingly.

For many students, this unique opportunity has been made possible thanks to donors from all over the world supporting the CERN & Society Foundation. \nOne of them, Yasemin Arik, has been a long-time supporter of Turkish Summer Students at CERN. We sat down with her and asked about her passions, her support for the cause and her experience with CERN. \n\nC&S: Allow me to start this interview by thanking you for agreeing to share your story. Talking about one\u2019s charitable gifts can start ripples of generosity. Tell me about you, your life. What are you passionate about? What is your personal mission? \nYA: I grew up in Turkey, as the daughter of two visionary scientists who decided to return to their home country in 1979, in the midst of the oil crisis and a military coup. It was a time of economic difficulty and political uncertainty. My brother and I grew up in a family dedicated to science. We became familiar with CERN from an early age, as our parents would often spend their summers there working on projects, and we would sometimes accompany them. I also remember their continuous struggles to find funding for research, and support PhD students, and their initiatives to start organisations nationally and internationally to help support the cause. \nMy brother and I subsequently applied for undergraduate / graduate schools abroad, and were able to get great education thanks to the scholarships we received. I therefore am a huge believer in the need to support and fund education and research. It provides equality of opportunity, and enables students, who don't have the means or the opportunities in their country, to realise their true potential. \nPrivate picture of Turkish scientist Engin Arik (left) and her family (Yasemin, top right). (Credits: Arik family) \nC&S: For years, your family has supported Turkish Summer Students coming to CERN for their training. Why did you first give for this cause? \nYA: We lost my late mother, Engin Arik, in a plane crash in 2007. She and her project team were flying to Southern Turkey for a workshop. This was part of an ongoing project she initiated to build an accelerator in Turkey, to be able to provide to Turkish scientists and students the opportunities for research and advanced study of particle physics. Their vision was to put Turkey on the map of technologically advanced nations in the world. The accident was indeed tragic. 55 people died. Among them was this team with this great vision that few were aware of at the time. The aim of our donations is to support this vision and commemorate those scientists who died in the accident, my mother among them. We have also been able to gather the support of friends and a few institutions who have generously made gifts, such as the one from Kale Group this year. \n\nC&S: Why have you continued donating? Why do you think this is important? \nYA: It isimportant to keep a continuous donation. This enables a continuous flow of students every year and for students to plan their academic research ahead of time. It also builds momentum for the following years. We have received a small settlement amount from the lawsuit regarding the plane crash which we earmarked for this purpose. I hope others will also keep contributing. Turkey becoming an associate member state in 2015 and ongoing media coverage of CERN and the research activity in Turkey will help keep this effort live. CERN can also support by providing donating individuals and institutions with opportunities to participate in the ecosystem. \n\nC&S: What does it mean for you to be a donor? \nYA: I care more about the cause being supported rather than me personally doing it. I will continue to support as my means allow. And grateful for any others who do the same. \nCan Yilmaz Altinigne, Turkish Summer Student at CERN supported by the CERN & Society Foundation in 2017 thanks to the generous donation of Yasemin Arik. (Credits: B. Nirta / CERN) \nC&S: What has been your donor experience so far? Is there anything you would like to see in the future/suggest for the future? \nYA: Research institutions should do more to appeal to the masses, make science more accessible, within its Member States and also internationally. This is an important part of benefiting society and outcomes, I feel. My impression is that today they are very much perceived as an elite institution.

The text is here below for those who were not present. \nDear Sudeshna, \nThis is not a speech, not one of those formal things... and I will keep it short. \nIn the name of the staff at CERN and the Staff Association, I would like to thank you for a number of things that we remember collectively. \nThe first one is Learning and Development. You have championed the function and built an impressive catalogue. Foremost you have introduced and developed the management training cursus. It was, and still is, much needed and is also very much appreciated! One of those fine opportunities at CERN to not only learn something, but also mingle with colleagues from other corners of the Organization and ultimately build a network! \nThe second is the introduction of Diversity at CERN. Looking back, as you did recently at TREF, it is so obvious that we have come such a long way. It is also obvious that you have been very instrumental in revealing this secret to all of us that our diversity makes also our strength and creativity and what CERN is all about finally. \nThe third one is of course the role of Ombud. You have dealt with all who came to see you very professionally of course, but you have managed to give us all at CERN a glimpse into your work, through the articles that you have published and the contacts that you have maintained, among others, with the Staff Association. It is so useful to have a friend who can hold a mirror to our face from time to time and bring us to reflect upon our own behaviour. \nIn a close I would like to say a couple words, in the name of the Staff Association: thank you , Sudeshna, for all you have done for CERN and for us! \nIn her own speech, Sudehsna expressed her thanks to the Staff Association for its work and achievements, but also for the support that she has received from the Staff Association while in difficult times when she was still a language teacher at CERN. \nShe also noted that her daughter, who was also present on this occasion, has benefitted greatly in her childhood from the Kindergarten of the Staff Association, which remains an essential element for diversity at CERN. \nBack in September this year, Sudeshna was invited one last time to a meeting of the Staff Council. Her presentation triggered many questions and interesting discussion and we ran out of time before exhausting the topic. A few days later, Sudeshna has confided to me her satisfaction of the very pertinent questions and the interest that Staff Council delegates had shown for the topics and the thoughts that she has shared. \nOnce again, thank you Sudeshna ! by", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sudeshna", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dear sudeshna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sudeshna datta-cockerill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sudehsna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "staff association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "staff council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ombud", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-25T09:20:09.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "086da03aff9b410cdb023aad47572b14887eca4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWB5j97_2AoOzAyAZAyV9TW22_Ga4bToFnWfNI9WOmkTeTi8OHtuxhWX2jRKUk8LojQaUncBiwPJA8_.ZMO5QZ", "site_full": "atlasvirtualvisit.web.cern.ch", "site": "cern.ch", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Cultura Ring Uruguay | atlasvirtualvisit.web.cern.ch", "title_full": "Cultura Ring Uruguay | atlasvirtualvisit.web.cern.ch", "published": "2017-10-25T20:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15765, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 8, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "086da03aff9b410cdb023aad47572b14887eca4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWB5j97_2AoOzAyAZAyV9TW22_Ga4bToFnWfNI9WOmkTeTi8OHtuxhWX2jRKUk8LojQaUncBiwPJA8_.ZMO5QZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-25T20:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cultura Ring Uruguay | atlasvirtualvisit.web.cern.ch", "text": "Wednesday, October 25, 2017 - 17:30 \n\nInvitamos a la visita virtual Am\u00e9rica Latina y El Caribe visita el CERN ! \n\"Latin\u200b \u200bAmerica\u200b \u200band\u200b \u200bThe\u200b \u200bCaribbean\u200b \u200bvisits\u200b \u200bCERN\u201d\u200b \u200bis\u200b \u200ban\u200b \u200binitiative\u200b \u200bpromoted\u200b \u200bthrough\u200b \u200bthe \"\u200bFriends\u200b of CERN \u200bNetwork\u200b\" \u200bin\u200b \u200bLatin American countries.\u200b \u200b The\u200b \u200bnetwork\u200b \u200bwas\u200b \u200bcreated\u200b \u200bby\u200b \u200bCultural\u200b \u200bRing\u200b \u200bin\u200b \u200bUruguay\u200b \u200bwith the\u200b \u200baim\u200b \u200bto\u200b \u200bdiffusion\u200b \u200bon\u200b \u200bScience\u200b \u200band\u200b \u200bdissemination\u200b \u200bof\u200b \u200bParticle\u200b \u200bPhysics\u200b \u200bin\u200b \u200bthe\u200b \u200bregion\u200b \u200band LAC\u200b \u200bcontinent.

These fields can be used to detect possible non-conservation of chirality in the QCD sector, a signature of sphaleron transitions. In particular, the interplay of chiral imbalance and magnetic fields results in the separation of positive and negative charges along the direction of the field, a phenomenon called \u201cChiral Magnetic Effect\u201d (CME). In this seminar, the challenges and the opportunities in the search for the CME and the detection of magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions will be discussed, with an emphasis on recent ALICE results.

On the outside, they look like a pair of Rubik\u2019s Cubes that rubbed a magic lamp and transformed into castle turrets. But on the inside, they\u2019ve got the glamour of a disco ball. \nThese 12m x 12m x 12m boxes are two prototypes for the massive detectors of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). DUNE, an international experiment hosted by Fermilab in the United States, will live deep underground and trap neutrinos: tiny fundamental particles that rarely interact with matter. \n\u201cLearning more about neutrinos could help us better understand how the early Universe evolved and why the world is made of matter and not antimatter,\u201d said Stefania Bordoni, a CERN researcher working on neutrino detector development. \nThese DUNE prototypes are testing two variations of a detection technique first developed by Nobel laureate Carlo Rubbia. Each cube is a chilled thermos that will hold approximately 800 tonnes of liquid argon. When a neutrino bumps into an atom of argon, it will release a flash of light and a cascade of electrons, which will glide through the electrically charged chamber to detectors lining the walls. \nInside their reinforced walls sits a liquid-tight metallic balloon, which can expand and contract to accommodate the changing volume of the argon as it cools from a gas to a liquid. \nEven though theses cubes are huge, they are mere miniature models of the final detectors, which will be 20 times larger and together hold a total of 72 000 tonnes of liquid argon. \nIn the coming months, these prototypes will be cooled down so that their testing can begin using a dedicated beam line at CERN\u2019s SPS accelerator complex.
