You\u2019re in luck; there are actually some pretty simple techniques you can use to boost the effectiveness of your workouts instantly. Bonus: They help you save time at the gym! Here are five to try during your next workout: \n1. Get explosive with your movements. Adding powerful bursts to your strength training movements can help you target more muscles at the same time. \u201cExplosive movements also cause your heart rate to spike, which taxes your cardiovascular system,\u201d says Ruben Belliard, founder of The Training Lab in New York. So how do you do it? It\u2019s all about pushing your body off the ground as part of the movement. Replace bodyweight squats with jumping squats, or instead of normal push-ups, try exploding up from the bottom and attempting to clap your hands together before finishing out the rep. \n2. Add intervals to your cardio. Running three miles at a steady pace is fine, but if you want to keep seeing results, speed things up by throwing in some intervals. \u201cYou can push yourself harder because you only need to go fast for a little bit,\u201d says Belliard. \u201cYour body isn\u2019t accustomed to going at that pace, so you\u2019ll see more results; improving your heart function and recovering faster between training days.\u201d A good way to do this? Play little games with yourself. \u201cIf you see a tree ahead, see how fast you can get to it,\u201d says Jimmy Minardi, personal trainer and founder of Minardi Training . \n3. Limit rest. It\u2019s natural to want to rest when your workout gets tough, but try to keep those breaks to a minimum. \u201cInstead of taking a break after each move, cycle through a complete set of the moves, then take a break,\u201d says Belliard. \u201cThe shorter the rest, the more taxing the workout will be on your cardiovascular system.\u201d Little by little you\u2019ll notice you won\u2019t need as much rest in future workouts because you can catch your breath faster. \n4. Focus on form. When you get tired, it\u2019s natural for form to suffer. Unfortunately, this can be a huge waste of time. \u201c100 bad push-ups are less beneficial than 10 really good ones,\u201d says Belliard. If you notice your form slipping, break your movements into smaller chunks so that you can do them all correctly. \n5. Change up your routine. Your body can adapt petty quickly to the same old workout, which is why getting into a rut can stop you from seeing results. One way to make sure you\u2019re doing lots of different movements: Take the workout outside. \u201cI see people at the gym who aren\u2019t getting any healthier and who look bored to tears,\u201d says Minardi. \u201cFind something you love to do outside\u2014like trail running, mountain biking, or kayaking. Each time you work out, it\u2019s going to be a little different, which will keep your body challenged.\u201d \n\nThis article is not intended to substitute for informed medical advice.

No worries, though. You can easily take your run indoors, provided you have access to an indoor track or treadmill. Treadmill running can be less taxing\u2014less wind resistance, less challenging terrain, momentum provided by a constantly-moving belt\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean you get off scot free. To add a layer of difficulty, you\u2019ll want to make a few adjustments. \u201cIf you structure your workout with greater discipline, you can more than make up for the variables that exist outside,\u201d says David Siik, author of The Ultimate Treadmill Workout and National Manager of Precision Running at Equinox fitness clubs. Here are a few ways to boost your indoor run workout\u2014and stay cool while embracing a challenge: \n5 Ways to Make Your Outdoor Run Treadmill Friendly \n1. Adjust The Treadmill Incline To 1 Percent \nEven on days when there\u2019s not much of a breeze, wind resistance plays a role in how much energy you need to expend to move your body forward. The best way to compensate? Set the treadmill incline a little higher. In a study at Exeter University, researchers asked nine men to run for six minutes at six different speeds. Five runs were conducted on a treadmill set at different inclines\u2014from 0 percent to 3 percent; the other run was done outside. Energy expenditure was determined by measuring oxygen consumption during the final two minutes of each run. The result? A 1 percent gradient\u2014not more and not less\u2014most accurately mimics the energy expenditure of an outdoor run. \n2. Pick Up The Pace \nIf you think you\u2019re working just as hard on the treadmill as you do outdoors, you might be fooling yourself. In a study at the University of Singapore, participants were asked to run outside for 3 minutes, then on a treadmill for 3 minutes, then outside again. Average running speed was calculated using a video camera. Turns out that while on the treadmill, the runners slowed way down, even though they were told to try to keep a similar pace as their outdoor runs. Researchers concluded that the lack of visual stimuli indoors was likely to blame. Compensate by intentionally picking up the pace on your treadmill run. If you normally run 9-minute miles, try 8:50s on the treadmill. If you run 8-minute miles, try for 7:50s. \n3. Up Your Game With Interval Training \n\u201cThe number one piece of advice that I give to runners is never get on a treadmill without knowing what you\u2019re planning to do,\u201d says Siik. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. You can plan to run for 10 minutes and pick up your pace every minute, or do a one-minute on, one-minute off type of workout. If you have a plan, you\u2019ll never be bored.\u201d Or try this 30-minute treadmill interval workout that Siik developed exclusively for Fitbit readers. \nThe Descent \nYou\u2019ll want to start with a medium effort run\u2014about 2 mph slower than what you think is your maximum speed (or Personal Record, PR) for one minute. You\u2019ll keep that speed on all intervals in the first half as you go up in incline. The reason this workout is called \u201cThe Descent\u201d is because it gets challenging in the second half.

But before you use that as an excuse to skip your warm-up or say adios to your cool down, it\u2019s important to know that the best way to help bypass injury is to stretch and strengthen \u2014 or mobilize and stabilize \u2014your joints. According to Trent Nessler, national director of sports medicine innovation at Select Medical, a combination of pre warm-up dynamic stretches and post-workout exercises works best. The reason is twofold. \u201cDynamic stretches prep the body for movement, and fatigued-state training reduces the risk of injury by reinforcing proper biomechanics. It also allows you to shave time off of your routine, because you don\u2019t have to complete as many sets and reps to hit full exertion,\u201d he says. \nPreventing injury is all about incorporating mobility exercises that instill proper movement at a higher, cerebral level\u2014in other words, your muscles and joints will move the way they should, without you having to think about it. Lay the foundation for pain-free fitness with these exercises. \n1. Sumo Squat \nAids in: hamstring, hip, and lumbar mobility \nPreventing injury is all about loading your system correctly. Nessler compares it to a car. \u201cIf all four tires are full, the wear pattern on the car is symmetrical, but if one wheel is flat, the load is uneven and the entire system breaks down more quickly.\u201d While the living tissue of the human body is better at adapting than rubber and steel, non-symmetrical or abnormal loading can eventually lead to sprains and strains. In fact, Nessler attributes a lack of mobility in the lower kinetic chain \u2014 spine to foot to ankle\u2014to 70% to 85% of running injuries. \nIn running, proper loading means that your glute medius has to contract to stabilize your pelvis as you stride. Sumo squats help withthat (and are essential if you work a desk job). \u201cSitting weakens glutes, which means that when you get into a running stride your muscles can\u2019t bear the weight needed to stabilize your pelvis,\u201d says Nessler. \u201cThat leads to excessive pelvic and knee motion, which can create patellofemoral pain syndrome (or pain in the front of the knee) and IT band friction.\u201d Strong glutes can limit this risk. \n2. Plank \nAids in: strengthening of the spinal extensors and core \nBodyweight planks top the list because of their high EMG signal \u2014 or measure of muscle contraction. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often amiss on form. \u201cNinety percent of athletes plank incorrectly,\u201d says Nessler. \u201cThey remember to keep a neutral spine but forget about maintaining square hips, instead allowing them to creep up.\u201d What this leads to is shortened hip flexors, which can cause an increased anterior pelvic tilt, disc slips, and lower back pain, he says. Practicing proper planks improves core strength, reduces your risk of knee injury, and improves vertical jump and power output, making your movements both safer and efficient. \n3. Dynamic Lunge \nAids in: dorsal and plantar flexion, a full ankle and hip mobility, and preserved lumbar spine mobility \nThe dynamic lunge is a movement that allows for full mobility of the hips. \u201cWhen you lunge, one hip is in max flexion while the other is contralateral in extension,\u201d says Nessler. This is especially critical for sprinters, who can experience lumbar spine and back pain if their hips aren\u2019t fully opened before they take on the 200-meter dash. \nThe dynamic lunge also helps you work on controlling and stabilizing the knee in the frontal plane, making sure that it tracks correctly (and that you don\u2019t fall victim to a narrow stance or make the mistake of shifting your weight forward and straining the ankle and knee of your leading leg). \n4. Side Plank \nAids in: strengthening the lower kinetic chain, stabilizing ankles \nWant to really engage your glutes? Look no further than the side plank, which strengthens everything in your lower kinetic chain, from your shoulder to your foot. Post-workout side planking is also a great test of ankle stability. If you\u2019re not able to hold a side plank and keep your ankle in a neutral state \u2014 signified by your tibia (or shin bone) dropping down towards the ground \u2014 you\u2019re likely at risk for ankle strains when running. Mastering the side plank could help strengthen your joints and stave off injury \n5. Hip Bridge \nAids in: strengthening the core, alleviating and preventing lower back pain \nAdrian Richardson, a workout curriculum designer and certified personal trainer for Fitbit Coach, adds hip bridges to his list of mobility exercises. Since they fully engage the posterior chain, hip bridges help to counter the daily focus placed on quads, thereby limiting the risk for tight IT bands (and subsequent knee and back pain). If you\u2019re a more advanced exerciser or looking for a challenge, you can take your mobility to the next level with the single-leg glute bridge. \nThis article is not intended to substitute for informed medical advice.

Time to put your feet up and indulge, right? Not so fast, says Jenny Spangler, former elite marathoner and coach of runners of all abilities. The tendency, says Spangler, is for runners to say, \u201cI\u2019m done. I\u2019m just going to hang out on the couch for a week.\u201d Down time is on the horizon, but first, it\u2019s important to keep moving. \nAs soon as possible after a race of any distance, Spangler recommends that you do a short cool down, jog, or walk. The next day, regardless of how you feel, do something for 20 to 30 minutes\u2014jog, walk, swim, or bike. Coaches often call this a \u201cshake out\u201d workout: just enough activity to get blood to your aching muscles, clean out waste products, and start the healing process. \nIt\u2019s advice Spangler herself has followed. \u201cI recover so much quicker if I just suck it up and do something,\u201d she says. Stay mobile on Monday. If you want to take Tuesday off, that\u2019s fine. \nThe same goes for nutrition. Post-race is the time to hydrate (with water, not beer) and eat healthy foods. \u201cDon\u2019t immediately reach for junk food,\u201d Spangler advises. While you may have accomplished your goal at the finish line, the race plan continues through recovery before you can fully relax. Here\u2019s what to do in those first 24 hours, depending on the distance you\u2019ve covered and the shape you\u2019re in. \n5K \nShort and intense, the 5K will leave you sore, but not too beat up. After the first day\u2019s shake out, Spangler recommends taking two to three days completely off\u2014then quickly building back up to your normal volume of training. \n\u201cKeeping your routine consistent is important,\u201d says Spangler. You don\u2019t want to take off so many days that you fall out of the habit. \nSpangler makes an exception to this advice for those who need to heal. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been nursing an injury leading up to the race and it was all you could do to get through, then you might need some time off,\u201d she says. Even if you\u2019re uninjured, the weeks after a race are a good time to take care of your body. Use the downtime to do things that you might have ignored during hard straining, such as stretching and foam rolling . \n10K to Half Marathon \n\u201cFor the half marathon, I usually start feeling the effects later on, the next week,\u201d says Spangler. Your shakeout will likely feel pretty good, but then Spangler recommends taking about a week entirely off. \u201cDo some light cross training\u2014if you need to do something,\u201d she adds. \nPeople tend to underestimate the recovery they need from these moderately long races, and worry that they\u2019re losing fitness. Spangler points out that it takes 10 days to 2 weeks before you begin losing the big cardiovascular gains from training. \u201cTaking a week or two off isn\u2019t going to kill you,\u201d she says. Besides doing the extras to take care of your body, use the time to plan your next big goal or do a house project you put off when you were focused on training. \nMarathon \nThe marathon takes your body to the extreme. Everyone is beat up after 26.2, and many are injured. You still need to move some the day after, but a walk is sufficient. If you got through the race cleanly\u2014no cramping, limping, or other issues\u2014Spangler recommends taking a week to 10 days completely off, then easing back into cross training and light jogging. \nRebuild your miles gradually, stepping up in a similar pattern that you stepped down during your taper before the race. \u201cStart with a quarter of what you\u2019ve been doing,\u201d says Spangler. \u201cIf you\u2019d been running 40 miles a week, do 10-15 miles the first week back.\u201d The next week you could do 50 percent of your normal mileage, easing back into things after that. Add intensity gradually as well, not hitting full workouts hard again until a month or so after your marathon. \nIf you\u2019re dealing with injuries from your training or the race, now is the time to address them. Don\u2019t train hard again until you\u2019re fully healed. There are no hard-and-fast rules; pay attention to your body, listen to your doctor and health care advisors, and rebuild as you are able. \nGoing Back For More \nAs to when you race again, Spangler agrees with the recovery rule of former masters marathon world record-holder Jack Foster, who said he took at least a day off racing for every mile covered. So, you can think about racing again 3 to 4 days after a 5K and a couple of weeks after a half marathon, but not until nearly a month after a marathon. \n\u201cThe big thing is to take care of your body the first days after,\u201d says Spangler. Then, take enough time so you come back to full strength without injury, but not so much that you get out of your workout routine or lose fitness. \nThis article is not intended to substitute for informed medical advice.

Spare Tire and Pump \nIt might seem somewhat obvious, but the first thing that comes to mind is a spare tire and a pump. As my younger self can attest, being stranded without a spare and waiting forever for fellow cyclists to pass by\u2014or being forced to hail a taxi\u2014isn\u2019t fun. \nWhile getting stuck can sometimes lead to new adventures\u2014like a warm day back in May when I was biking through the country and got a double puncture only to have my awesome wife come pick me up and enjoy the weather and a late lunch with freshly harvested asparagus\u2014it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Now, I always pack one spare tire and repair kit in my saddlebag and affix it with some velcro under my seat so it\u2019s out of the way. \n2. Money \nYou never know when a short ride might turn into an epic journey, so having cash on hand is smart. You might go for an entire ride and spend nothing, but it\u2019s nice to have a few dollars in case you want to swing by a local bakery for coffee or if you find yourself in need of a new tire. \n3 . Identification (and a Fully-Charged Cell Phone) \nHaving some form of identification on you at all times is a must. I always keep one ID card in the pocket or my jersey and another in a RoadID on my wrist. Early in my career\u2014before the internet and mobile phones\u2014I went on a ride from Berlin to my parents place about 280 km away. I\u2019d done it a few times before, but this time the combination of rain, a huge semitrailer, and poor timing led me to slip off the tarmac, crash, and break my collarbone. I was lucky enough to be able to hitchhike to the next city\u2019s hospital, call my wife, and have her rescue me. But this incident made me realize the importance of having identification\u2014especially when riding alone. \n4. Liquids and Food \nI carry two bottles on my bike at all times\u2014one with plain tap water and another with syrup mixed in. Why? Water aids in hydration, and a mix sweetened with sucrose (table sugar) can help give you that extra boost of energy when fatigue sets in. I also bring along some fuel such as bananas and muesli bars in case hunger strikes. \n5. Light Jacket \nI try to limit what I bring out on the road, but depending on the weather I tuck a light rain jacket or windbreaker into one of the pockets on my jersey. Sometimes I can\u2019t help but feel like some kind of kangaroo with all of my pockets stuffed with food, money, and drinks, but I\u2019m always prepared. \n6. Helmet \nNeedless to say, a helmet is always a must. Not convinced? Look at the numbers. An Australian study of more than 64,000 cyclist found that helmets reduce the risk of a serious head injury by nearly 70% and that cyclists who wear helmets reduce their chance of a fatal head injury by 65%. \nThis article is not intended to substitute for informed medical advice.

The winter squash provides plenty of filling fiber, and outshines the daily recommendations for vitamin A and C. Curry powder adds big fragrance and flavor, as well as health benefits, thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties . Warm and soothing, make a big pot on Sunday, and let it nourish body and soul all week. INGREDIENTS \n1 butternut squash (about 2\u00bd lbs/1.25 kg), peeled, seeded, and cubed 2 tart apples, such as Granny Smith, peeled, cored, and cubed 2 tablespoons canola oil 1-inch (2.5-cm) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated 1\u00bd tablespoons curry powder 8 cups (64 fl oz/2 l) chicken or vegetable broth, reduced sodium 2 tablespoons maple syrup Spiced Pepitas for topping (recipe below) INSTRUCTIONS \nPreheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Place the butternut squash and apples on a large rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the canola oil, and toss to coat. Season lightly with salt. Roast until the squash and apples are soft when pierced with a fork, about 20 minutes. \nIn a large pot over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 until tender, 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and saut\u00e9 until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the curry powder and stir until fragrant, 30 seconds. \nAdd the roasted squash, apples, and broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, and simmer to let the flavors combine, 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the maple syrup. \nLet cool slightly. Working in batches if necessary, transfer to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Return to the pot to warm through. Season with salt to taste. \nLadle the soup into bowls, top with the spiced pepitas, and serve warm. Makes 4 servings \nSpiced Pepitas \nSprinkle a spoonful of these spicy seeds on top of the curried butternut squash soup. You\u2019ll have plenty of seeds leftover, but they\u2019re also delicious in salads or as snacks.

But what if you picked up a set of reasonably heavy dumbbells and never let them go? With this don\u2019t drop the weight, two-dumbbell sequence, you\u2019ll perfect your form while getting firm as you seamlessly transition from one movement to the other. Get ready to train your entire body and condition in minimal time! Repeat 3 to 5 times, depending on your experience level, resting for 1 to 2 minutes between rounds. \nDumbbell Triceps Kickback \nTargets: Triceps \nHold two dumbbells by your sides with your palms facing inward. With your torso hinged forward and your knees slightly bent, kick your arms back. Your upper arms should be close to your torso and remain stationary throughout the movement\u2014only your forearm should move. At the top of the movement, your arm should be fully extended. Pause at the top of the contraction, then slowly lower the dumbbell back to your starting position. Do 5-8 reps, don\u2019t drop the weight, and continue into the next move. \nDumbbell Lunge and Curl \nTargets: Biceps and quadriceps \nWith palms facing forward and a dumbbell in each hang, step one foot forward and lunge. Bringing your back leg down, try to make your leading leg almost parallel with the floor. Be sure not to let your knee surpass your toes. As you lower into a lunge, curl both dumbbells up to your shoulders (making sure to keep your arms close to your side). Lower the dumbbells as you stand. Switch legs; do TK reps on each side. Then, don\u2019t drop the weight, and continue into the next move. \nDumbbell Row \nTargets: Middle back (latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, lower traps, and erector spinae) \nGet into a plank position\u2014hands under your shoulders, toes pressed into the floor, hips square, and neck and spine neutral. With a dumbbell in each hand, pull (or row) one arm back at a time. Concentrate on squeezing your back muscles rather than simply pulling with your arms. Switch arms, and repeat once on each side. Do 5-8 reps on each side, don\u2019t drop the weight, and continue into the next move. \nLooking for an added challenge? Break up your rows by doing a push-up in between. Just be sure to maintain proper form (and don\u2019t let your hips creep up!). \nDumbbell Floor Press \nTarget: chest, shoulders \nLay on your back holding a dumbbell in each hand. With your grip slightly wider than shoulder width apart, angle the dumbbells about 45-degrees away from your torso and keep your elbows tucked in. Lower the dumbbells until your elbows touch the ground. Then, press back up. Do 5-8 reps, don\u2019t drop the weight, and continue into the next move. \nStanding Curtsey Lunge With Dumbbells \nTarget: Glutes, abductors, adductors \nHolding a dumbbell in each hand, step one leg behind the other at an angle. For example, if lunging your left leg back, angle it to the right so that your thighs cross. Bend both knees and lower (as if you were curtseying). Make sure your front knee doesn\u2019t surpass your front ankle. Do 5-8 reps. \n\nRest for 1 to 2 minutes. Pick up the weights, and repeat the sequence, starting again with Dumbbell Triceps Kickback. \nThis article is not intended to substitute for informed medical advice.

But before you blame the clock \u2014 or your mile-long to do list \u2014 rethink your training. Don\u2019t be so quick to assume you can\u2019t squeeze in exercise. \u201cPeople think a workout needs to be a full hour to be effective, but that\u2019s a huge misconception,\u201d says Erin Schirack, director of cycle at Studio Three in Chicago. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to take that much time!\u201d So how do you get in and out of the gym a lot faster? Use these tips to shave time off your workout, banishing the \u201cno time\u201d excuse forever \n1. Have a plan . A lot of time can be wasted wandering around the gym, heading from machine to machine, and wondering what you should do next. Cut down on waste by planning your training before you even lace up. \u201cI take a notepad and write out exactly what I want to do beforehand,\u201d says Schirack. \u201cI\u2019ll pick three exercises, like squats, push-ups, and side planks, and do a circuit of those moves three times.\u201d \n2. Get your music ready to go . It seems simple, but having a playlist queued up cuts back on time wasted browsing through your playlist. Not only can it help make exercise feel easier (and lower the perceived rate of exertion), but music can also make you more powerful in your movement and even increase your speed ; just be sure to choose an upbeat song. Need help on where to start? Check out these playlists that are guaranteed to get you through any workout. \n3. Reduce distractions . \u201cPeople like to talk at the gym\u2014it can be a very social place\u2014so I put headphones in even if I\u2019m not listening to music,\u201d says Karen Lee, a Tier 3 Plus trainer and master instructor at Equinox River Oaks in Houston. \u201cThis keeps me focused so I can get in and get out without socializing.\u201d Other tips to help you keep your mind on your muscles and your muscles on your mind: put your phone on vibrate, leave your daily worries and stressors outside the gym doors, and use visualization techniques to help you focus on the mind-muscle connection. \n4. Avoid moves that only target one muscle . There\u2019s a time and place for single body part movements, but if you\u2019re aiming for efficiency, switch to compound movements to get the most bang for your buck. \u201cInstead of doing 20 sit-ups, do a plank for 30 seconds,\u201d says Schirack. \u201cHolding a static plank works your core, arms, shoulders, glutes, and upper back at the same time.\u201d Other compound movements that can help shave time off of your routine: dips (which train chest, triceps, and shoulders), bench presses (which target the chest, shoulders, triceps, and back), and squats (which hit quads, glutes, and even encourages you to work on core stabilization). \n5. Work out with heavier weights . Doing a lot of reps with five-pound weights takes a lot longer than doing few reps with 20-pound weights. Going heavier allows you to challenge yourself in a shorter amount of time, just make sure you\u2019re maintaining proper form and go until you can\u2019t do another rep. \n6. Get your cardio in with high-intensity bursts. Steady-state cardio has its benefits, but slogging along on the treadmill at a walking pace can get old fast. Change things up by adding in higher-intensity cardio bursts. Not only will your cardio breeze by but because of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), you\u2019ll also burn calories long after your sweat session has ended. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated either. \u201cEven just jumping rope for two minutes will get your heart rate way up,\u201d says Schirack. \n7. Do supersets when strength training . \u201cPeople waste a huge amount of time at the gym resting between sets,\u201d says Schirack. \u201cThere\u2019s no need! Pick two moves that work different body parts\u2014like squats and push-ups\u2014and alternate them so you\u2019re not just sitting around.\u201d By shortening your rest period you\u2019ll increase the intensity and perform more work in less time. \n8. Sign up for a shorter class. \u201cMany gyms offer class formats that are as short as 25 or 30 minutes,\u201d says Lee. \u201cTake one of those and you don\u2019t have to think about anything\u2014your trainer creates a routine, gives you instruction, and makes sure you\u2019re doing the moves correctly.\u201d Not sure what classes are available in your area ?

Not only did I participate in my first triathlon, I also experienced my very first open-water ocean swim. Though I only did the sprint distance\u2014a 500m swim, 20m bike ride, and 5km run\u2014I was proud of my finish time of 1:09:21. It was a close second place finish that left me 9 seconds behind the winner. \nI was living in the moment and don\u2019t remember every second of the race, but here\u2019s how it went down. My swim took about 12:30, my bike ride was 32 minutes, and finished the run in 22 minutes\u2014with a few minutes of transitioning between sports. I was 19th out of the water, but after the bike ride I caught up with the lead group. When we started the run, I was maybe 5 or 10 seconds behind them. I managed to pass some of the other athletes to finish second in the end. \nAfter successfully finishing my first triathlon, I was on a high on endorphins for about two hours, chatting and smiling to everyone. There were 225 starters, and the top finishers were awarded ]vouchers to spend at a local bike shop. Of course, I gave the prize back and asked them to donate it to a local kid. After all, I wasn\u2019t in it for the money\u2014I was in it for the experience. Funny thing was I was still able to walk normally and felt better than I have in a long time. I felt alive. \nDoes this mean I don\u2019t feel alive when I\u2019m not suffering and pushing my body to new limits, or when I do daily chores such as feeding the rabbits, or walking our dogs, Linda and Lilly? No, of course not. My life is great, I have a wonderful family, an incredible wife and six beautiful children. I mean, who would have thought that my life would be like this when I was a young amateur bike rider just starting out in reunited Germany with a meagre $3000. You might think I should be happy and relaxed, but my need to stay active and constantly be challenged plays into the element of addiction; this element where you need to prove yourself to yourself. \nWhy did I run 4 marathons this year? Why did I participate in a fun race during the Cyclo-Cross World Cup last month in Waterloo Wisconsin? Why did I finish a triathlon earlier today? After looking at it from all different angles and different perspectives there is only one honest answer: I\u2019m in the middle of a midlife crisis. And I\u2019m embracing it wholeheartedly. \nBut hey, at least my kind of midlife crisis is better than going out and buying a red Ferrari, right? And, nevertheless, I\u2019m damn proud of my second place finish! Hell yeah. \nThis article is not intended to substitute for informed medical advice.

Running can be an uphill battle\u2014literally. You might start out of the gate quickly, but keeping a steady pace, finding your stride, and holding strong can be tough when motivation is low. Whether you\u2019re working on getting over that four-mile hump, pushing yourself to finish the last leg of your half-marathon, or just looking to complete the first ten minutes of your couch-to-5k, visualization can help. Embrace the power of your mind, and overcome physical challenges, with these expert tips. \n1. Focus On The Process \nFocusing on the process and living in the moment\u2014especially during a long run\u2014can make it easier to get to the end. \u201cIf you\u2019ve planned to run five miles but, part way through you\u2019re thinking \u2018Oh my god, I don\u2019t know if I can do 3.5 more\u2014my body is hurting,\u2019, focusing on the process can help,\u201d says Nicole Detling, PhD, mental performance coach for professional athletes. Breaking up the larger challenge into smaller, bite-sized segments can make the task easier to digest. Detling\u2019s advice: Get out of your head, and stay in the moment. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a tree ahead and you tell yourself to run to it,\u201d she says. \u201cThen you run to the lamp post that\u2019s up ahead, then to the next fence. Before you know it, you\u2019re another mile in.\u201d \n2. Engage In Smart Self Talk \nVisualization techniques aren\u2019t just defined by what you see\u2014self talk plays a role, too. You can think of it as your mind guiding your body, though it\u2019s a process that differs for everyone. \u201cFor some people, cue words\u2014terms you repeat to yourself during the most challenging parts of your journey\u2014might be motivational, while for others they might be instructional,\u201d says Detling. It\u2019s the difference between telling yourself, \u201cI can do this,\u201d and \u201cTake a deep breath,\u201d versus \u201cKeep a short, quick stride\u201d and \u201cElbows at 90-degrees or less.\u201d \nDon\u2019t shy away from giving yourself tough love either. While some might group it as \u201cnegative self-talk,\u201d the \u201cdig deep, get gritty, push through\u201d approach could work for you. \n3. Focus On The Win \nFor some people, thinking about the endorphin-rush that comes with crossing the finish line is key. Whether it\u2019s a mile marker, new goal, or the actual finish, imaging the goal you\u2019re working for today, and how amazing you\u2019ll feel when you accomplish it, can help fuel your drive when motivation lulls. If the reward is worth the journey that you\u2019re putting yourself through, focusing on the end result could be that much-needed push. \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad \n4. Mind Your Breath \nAdopting a steady rhythm by timing your breathing with your step count is another key visualization tactic. \u201cDepending on your stride length, and how fast you\u2019re breathing in the moment, you could inhale on one, count 2-3-4, and on the next step inhale again,\u201d says Detling. \u201cOr, inhale, count 2-3-4, and then exhale.\u201d It\u2019s less about the number you choose, and more about staying busy\u2014and keeping thoughts of self-doubt at bay. \n\u201cFinding your rhythm and timing your breathing with your step count tends to occupy enough of your conscious brain space to allow you to stop thinking about the pain or distance that remains,\u201d says Detling says. \u201c Research also shows that when you\u2019re able to regulate your breathing, your body can go a bit farther and push through a little bit more, because you\u2019re more in control of your running and pace.\u201d \nLooking for a refresher? Use the Relax feature on your Fitbit Charge 2, Fitbit Blaze, or Fitbit Ionic for a guided breathing experience. Each two-minute or five-minute session uses your real-time heart rate to measure beat-to-beat changes and determine a breathing rate that\u2019s comfortable for you. \n5. Map A Route \nIt\u2019s often said that preparation is the key to success, and knowing what your roadmap looks like before you lace up is a great way to accurately visualize your steps before you take them. It\u2019s a trick Detling recommends to many of her cross country collegiate runners. \u201cGoogle maps is incredible these days,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can look at the route and note monuments or markers\u2014such as a big tree, funny-looking rock, or where you come onto or go out of a clearing. Then, attach cues.\u201d If mile five is usually a struggle, and you know that\u2019s when the tall building appears on your course, use that landmark to remind you relax and refocus\u2014whether that means breathing, counting, or distracting yourself by singing in your head. \nAfter planning your route, Detling recommends spending 5 to10 minutes the night before visualizing your plan of attack. \u201cIt evokes a feeling of confidence because you\u2019re more in control of the race and have an idea of what to expect,\u201d adds Detling. \u201cYou\u2019re not just planning what you\u2019re going to do physically, you\u2019re planning mentally, too.\u201d \nThis article is not intended to substitute for informed medical advice.

I\u2019ve recently been coaching Kim Peiffer, an editor at InStyle magazine, for her first marathon in New York City this November. Training her has been somewhat nostalgic. The emotions first-time runners experience while training for their big day run the gamut\u2014from anxious and excited to intimidated, nervous, oreven a slight sense of dread. I was no different. \nI\u2019ll never forget getting on the bus going to the start of my first 26.2-mile race in 2007 at the London Marathon. I remember saying goodbye to my wife and parents and being so overwhelmed with emotion that I began to tear up. Your first marathon is a one of a kind experience. As my teammate Deena Kastor\u2014Olympic Bronze Medalist in Athens Olympic Marathon and US record holder for the marathon\u2014told me before my first marathon, \u201cYou only get one chance to make a first impression.\u201d Make your experience a positive one by avoiding these all-too-common newbie mistakes. \nGoing Out Too Hard \nThe most talked about and obvious mistake first-time marathoners make is going out too hard. Excitement is important, but don\u2019t let it become your downfall. Technology has come so far from the days when I had to run with a clunky chest strap and brick-sized watch weighing me down. With your sleek-fitting Fitbit tracker, you can see your heart rate in real time. Knowing your heart rate when you\u2019re training, especially during your long runs, can help you gauge what you can sustain for an entire marathon. See your number climbing as you start out of the gate? Slow down. Regardless of whether the ground is flat, uphill, or downhill, I always encourage my runners to aim for an even effort (as opposed to an even pace), which is best gauged by heart rate. \nForgetting To Monitor Nutrition \nThe next big mistake I see first-time marathoners make is not practicing pre-race and in-race nutrition . Before you hit the ground running, fuel smart. Most first-time marathoners hit a wall because they\u2019re carb depleted after 2 or more hours of running. The way to offset this is to both carb-load two days prior to your race and reach for easy-to-digest carbs during the race. \nWhen you start training for a marathon, you should look on the race website and find out what kind of electrolyte beverage they will be serving on the course. Then go and pick up that exact drink to use during every long run in your training. It\u2019s easiest for your body to digest calories on the run when you\u2019re still somewhat fresh, even if you aren\u2019t hungry or thirsty. Prep for this (and reduce your risk of stomach distress) by drinking 6 to 8 oz of an electrolyte beverage every 2 to 3 miles of the race and on long training runs. \nAdditionally, make a point to use your long runs to refine your pre-marathon meal. Find what works for you and stick with it. My wife Sara and I are fortunate to be sponsored by Cytomax and Muscle Milk, and I\u2019ve discovered the pre-race breakfast that works best for me is a shake made with300 calories of Cytocarb and one scoop of Muscle Milk. \nWearing The Wrong Shoes \nThe last mistake is a game changer: shoes. Running doesn\u2019t require a lot of gear, but it\u2019s important to get your shoe choice right. I\u2019ve been working with one of the kids on our local high school\u2019s cross country team who has been struggling with an injury. As soon as I put him in the correct pair of shoes he was immediately able to run and train again. \nSo, which shoes should you be in? The pair that is right for you. I highly recommend going to your local running store and having them watch you run, so they can recommend a pair that is right for your mechanics. Focusing on just style and price can steer you in the wrong direction. Finding the right pair can keep you from getting injured, so if you need to pay a little more for quality, it\u2019s money well spent. Also, remember to choose smart footwear even during your down time. \n\nThis article is not intended to substitute for informed medical advice.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors, including: the effects of the highly competitive market in which we operate, including competition from much larger technology companies; our ability to anticipate and satisfy consumer preferences in a timely manner; our ability to successfully develop and timely introduce new products and services or enhance existing products and services; retail and customer acceptance of existing and new products; any inability to accurately forecast consumer demand and adequately manage our inventory; our ability to ship products on the timelines we anticipate and unexpected delays; our ability to detect, prevent or fix quality issues in our products or services; uncertain ability to retain employees; our reliance on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers, and our limited control over such parties; delays in procuring components and product from these third parties or their suppliers; the ability of third parties to successfully manufacture and ship in a timely manner quality products; seasonality; product liability issues, security breaches or other defects, which may adversely affect product performance, our reputation and brand awareness and overall market acceptance of our products and services; ability to integrate acquired technologies and employees into our operations, particularly in new geographies; warranty claims; the fact that the market for connected health and fitness devices is relatively new and unproven; the ability of our channel partners to sell our products; litigation and related costs; privacy; and other general market, political, economic and business conditions. \nAdditional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results are included under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the full year ended December 31, 2016 , and our most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fitbit.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov . All forward-looking statements contained herein are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. \nQuarterly Reporting Calendar \nOur fiscal year ends on December 31 of each year. In the first quarter of 2016, we adopted a 4-4-5 week quarterly calendar. We did not adjust operating results for quarters prior to 2016. There were 91 days in each of the three months ended September 30, 2017 and October 1, 2016. \nDisclosure of Material Information \nannounces material information to its investors using SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and on its Investor Relations page on the company\u2019s website at http://investor.fitbit.com . \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and effective non-GAAP tax rate. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. \nWe use non-GAAP measures to internally evaluate and analyze financial results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. \nThere are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, many of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of certain items, specifically stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, interest income (expense), net and the related income tax effects of the aforementioned exclusions, that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation. \nGuidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes Jawbone litigation costs, stock-based compensation, impact of restructuring, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and tax effects associated with these items. We have not reconciled guidance for non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items that impact these measures are uncertain, out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. \nThe following are explanations of the adjustments that are reflected in one or more of our non-GAAP financial measures: Stock-based compensation expense relates to equity awards granted primarily to our employees. We exclude stock-based compensation expense because we believe that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, companies calculate stock-based compensation expense using a variety of valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions. In January 2017 , we conducted a reorganization of its business, including a reduction in workforce. The restructuring costs impacted our results for the first quarter of 2017. Restructuring costs primarily included severance-related costs. We believe that excluding this expense provides greater visibility to the underlying performance of our business operations, and facilitates comparison of our results with other periods, and may also facilitate comparison with the results of other companies in our industry. Litigation expense relates to legal costs incurred due to litigation with Aliphcom, Inc. d/b/a Jawbone. We exclude these expenses because we do not believe these expenses have a direct correlation to the operations of our business and because of the singular nature of the claims underlying the Jawbone litigation matters. We began excluding Jawbone litigation costs in the second quarter of 2016 as these costs significantly increased in 2016, and may continue to be material for the remainder of 2017. Although not excluded in reporting for the first quarter of 2016, these litigation expenses were $9.1 million In March 2014 , we recalled the Fitbit Force after some of our users experienced allergic reactions to adhesives in the wristband. This recall primarily impacted our results for the fourth quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2015. Amortization of intangible assets relates to our acquisition of FitStar, Pebble and Vector. We exclude these amortization expenses because we do not believe these expenses have a direct correlation to the operation of our business. Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments relates to the tax effect of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP financial measures such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, restructuring and valuation allowance in order to provide a more meaningful measure of non-GAAP net income (loss). Purchase of property and equipment is deducted from net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to arrive at non-GAAP free cash flow, which reflects the amount of cash generated that is available to be used for investments in the business. \nAbout Fitbit, Inc.

Your legs are screaming. Your breathing is ragged. You have no choice but to slow down. Then you round a corner and see the finish line just a quarter of a mile away. Suddenly, you feel better! Physically nothing has changed, but your stride lengthens, your pace increases, and you finish strong. \nThis common experience is a prime example of how your mind controls your perception of fatigue. New research is revealing that fatigue doesn\u2019t always occur when you reach your physical limits, but rather when your brain tells you that you\u2019ve reached your limits. While this function exists to protect you from efforts that will hurt you, your brain often misinterprets signals and overprotects out of fear. But with the right kind of training it\u2019s possible to overcome this overprotection and convince your brain that a higher level of effort won\u2019t hurt \u2014 but instead empower \u2014 you. \nAuthor and athlete Matt Fitzgerald maintains that in order to train your brain to accept more discomfort (and strengthen \u201cmental fitness\u201d) you should be \u201csuffering for the sake of suffering\u201d on occasion. \u201cMost of your workouts should be gentle and comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there are some you should set aside where training mental toughness is part of the objective.\u201d In these workouts, expose yourself to near race-level suffering. \u201cDiscomfort should be an explicit objective of the workout,\u201d explains Fitzgerald. \nWhat this means in practice may look much like training you\u2019ve done before, with the mindset that you want to stretch your limits and accept new levels of discomfort. Simply acknowledging that the perceived discomfort and fatigue is not something to be avoided but part of the goal can make it more bearable and enable you to endure more. \nHere are a few ways Fitzgerald recommends brain training for toughness. None of these workouts are easy, but they do pay off. Not only will you emerge a faster runner, but you\u2019ll also be empowered. \u201cYou come out feeling pretty proud of yourself,\u201d says Fitzgerald. \u201cYou walk away having proved something to yourself that you can apply in races.\u201d \n1) Try Harder \nThe fact that you can never run at 100%\u2014because your brain stops you long before you get there\u2014means that you know your body can always go a bit harder. Trying to exceed what you did last time, either in speed or distance, is the most basic way you expand your limits. \u201cYou put a stake in the ground with a particular type of workout, and then you try to push a little further,\u201d says Fitzgerald. \u201cAnd when you go through those experiences and realize, \u2018Hey, that workout didn\u2019t kill me,\u2019 you\u2019re more likely to be able to dig a little deeper the next time.\u201d \n2) Run Hills That Hurt \nRunning hills at race pace can be an effective way of ramping up the mental difficulty. Your running mechanics will carry you at a previously-learned pace, but the incline often boosts the effort to a harder level than you would experience on flat terrain. When you get to that level, instead of panicking and slowing to trying to avoid the discomfort, Fitzgerald recommends telling yourself, \u201cThis is where I want to be.\u201d Climb that hill and embrace suffering as the goal. \n3) Time-Trial Finish \nAnother way to stretch your mental limits is to add a time trial to the end of a workout. After a solid-but-sensible workout like 6 x 1000 meter runs at a tempo pace (fast but not hard), try adding a 1-mile time trial\u2014going as fast as you can. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running a mile on fatigued legs, the idea is not to PR,\u201d says Fitzgerald. Your time doesn\u2019t matter. The idea is to get comfortable with the uncomfortable. \n4) Experiment With Open-Loop Runs \nTake time completely out of the equation with an open-loop run. Fitzgerald recommends finding a short loop \u2014one or two miles long\u2014and running until you\u2019re really tired but not defeated. The layout of the course makes all the difference. With loops you have to get your mind around continuing indefinitely rather than making it through a set distance. You also give yourself the chance to bail at any time. \u201cIt can be eye opening exercise, because you have to approach it with a completely different mindset,\u201d says Fitzgerald. The open-ended run can trick you into exceeding predetermined expectations. \nThis article is not intended to substitute for informed medical advice.
