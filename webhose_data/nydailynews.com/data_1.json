Twins counterpart Jason Castro, it should be noted, allowed three of the Yankees\u2019 four stolen bases (two while Santana was pitching) on Sept. 18. \nEDGE: Yankees Gary Sanchez gives the Yankees the edge over the Twins when it comes to comparing catchers. (Abbie Parr/Getty Images) FIRST BASE \nGreg Bird, who started the season as the team\u2019s No.3 hitter, finally made it back from a frustrating four months dealing with a nagging ankle injury to post eight homers and 25 RBI in 29 games after Aug. 26. Former AL MVP Joe Mauer only hit seven homers, but he still hit .305 with an .801 OPS. \nEDGE: Twins Joe Mauer gives the Twins an edge at first base. (Bruce Kluckhohn/AP) SECOND BASE \nAll-Star Starlin Castro missed a couple of sizable chunks of the season, but he still batted .300 with respectable power numbers (16 HRs, 63 RBI) in a career-low 473 plate appearances, mostly from the 5-hole in the lineup. Minnesota leadoff man Brian Dozier has slugged 76 homers with an average of 96 RBI the past two seasons. \nEDGE: Even SHORTSTOP \nUnlikely cleanup hitter Didi Gregorius no longer is being doubted as Derek Jeter\u2019s replacement, posting a star-turning campaign on both sides of the ball, including 25 homers (breaking Jeter\u2019s team record at the position) with 87 RBI. Jorge Polanco knocked in 74 runs and stole 13 bases but committed twice as many errors (18-9) as Gregorius. \nEDGE: Yankees Didi Gregorius hit 25 home runs this season. (Bill Kostroun/AP) THIRD BASE \nDeadline pickup and Jersey boy Todd Frazier provided some power and a slight defensive upgrade over Chase Headley, hitting 11 of his 27 homers after arriving from the White Sox. Eduardo Escobar filled in ably for injured All-Star Miguel Sano, who is injured and not on Tuesday's roster. \nEDGE: Even LEFT FIELD \nBrett Gardner still provides Gold Glove-caliber defense and veteran leadership with a nice mix of power (career-high 21 homers) and speed (team-best 23 steals). Cleanup hitter Eddie Rosario batted .290 with 27 homers and an .836 OPS for the Twins. \nEDGE: Even CENTER FIELD \nJacoby Ellsbury, the $153 million signee who was benched for the 2015 wild-card game, reclaimed regular playing time while his replacement Aaron Hicks spent a couple of stints on the DL, batting .293 after Aug. 2. Former No. 2 overall pick Byron Buxton finally broke through as a potential star with 16 home runs and 29 steals. And in the second half of the season, he\u2019s hit .300 with 11 of those home runs. \nEDGE: Twins Byron Buxton (l.) gives the Twins the edge in center field while Brian Dozier (r.) is evenly matched against Starlin Castro at second base. (Brad Penner/USA Today Sports) RIGHT FIELD \nWhat more can we say about 6-foot-7 Aaron Judge\u2019s astounding rookie season? The AL MVP candidate overcame a lengthy August swoon to put up his best month yet in September, finishing the year with 52 homers, 114 RBI and league bests in runs (128), walks (122) and yes, strikeouts (208). Twins counterpart Max Kepler hit .243 with 19 homers. \nEDGE: Yankees DESIGNATED HITTER \nAs of printing, Girardi had yet to reveal his choice, but the switch-hitters, Headley or Hicks, could be used instead of veteran Matt Holliday, who is 5-for-12 lifetime against Santana. Outfielder Robbie Grossman (.246, nine HRs) has been handling much of the DH duties. Sano (28-77) returned from shin problems to take five at-bats the final weekend but the Twins have determined he is unable to play. \nEDGE: Even Luis Severino has emerged as the Yankees' ace. (Kathy Willens/AP) \nLuis Severino emerged as the front-of-the-rotation ace the Yankees thought they\u2019d developed before a one-year derailment saw him go winless as a starter (0-8) in 2016, and spend parts of that season either in the minors or in the bullpen. The 23-year-old righty made his first All-Star team and finished 14-6 with a 2.98 ERA to go along with 230 strikeouts to earn this start over deadline acquisition Sonny Gray and erstwhile ace Masahiro Tanaka. Severino notably lasted only three-plus innings in his first career start against the Twins in late September. Ervin Santana possibly enjoyed the best season of his 13-year career (16-8, 3.28 ERA), but he\u2019s 6-10 with a 5.66 ERA in 20 career starts against the Yanks. \nEDGE: Yankees BULLPEN \nCloser Aroldis Chapman has rebounded from some midseason shakiness, while the deadline additions of David Robertson and the hard-throwing Tommy Kahnle along with the emergence of strikeout machine Chad Green, give the Yanks a six-deep relief corps to shorten games, even if four-time All-Star setup man Dellin Betances has endured an uneven second half. The Twins unloaded All-Star closer Brandon Kintzler before the deadline, leaving manger Paul Molitor to rely mostly on righty Matt Belisle (nine saves), and the unheralded trio of Taylor Rogers (a lefty), Trevor Hildenberg and Alan Busenitz. Starter Jose Berrios (14-8, 3.89) also is available Tuesday in relief, Molitor said, but this category figures to be the Yankees\u2019 biggest edge of all. \nEDGE: Yankees PREDICTION \nWe all know anything can happen in a one-game scenario, but the Yankees' history of success against Santana and the overwhelming bullpen disparity should be enough to advance them into the AL division series against Cleveland.

searching, authorities concede they're no closer to finding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Authorities no closer to finding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Updated:  39 AM \nSYDNEY \u2014 A report on the almost three-year search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 said Tuesday the continuing mystery over the fate of the plane and the 239 people on board is \"almost inconceivable.\" \nBut the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's final report on the search, which was abandoned in January, concedes that authorities are no closer to knowing the reasons for the plane's disappearance, or its exact location. This is despite last year's narrowing down of its most likely resting place to a 25,000-square kilometer (9,650-square mile) patch of the southern Indian Ocean. \nThe Boeing 777 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew disappeared soon into its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. \nA 52-day surface search covered an area of several million square kilometers (square miles) in the Indian Ocean west of Australia, before an underwater search mapped 710,000 square kilometers (274,000 square miles) of seabed at depths of up to 6,000 meters (20,000 feet). They were the largest aviation searches of their kind in history, the bureau said. \nDespite other methods such as studying satellite imagery and investigating ocean drifts after debris from the plane washed ashore on islands in the eastern Indian Ocean and the east coast of Africa, the 1,046-day search was called off by the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia on Jan. 17. \n\"The reasons for the loss of MH370 cannot be established with certainty until the aircraft is found,\" the bureau, which coordinated the search, said in the 440-page report. \n\"It is almost inconceivable and certainly societally unacceptable in the modern aviation era with 10 million passengers boarding commercial aircraft every day, for a large commercial aircraft to be missing and for the world not to know with certainty what became of the aircraft and those on board,\" it said. \n\"The ATSB expresses our deepest sympathies to the families of the passengers and crew on board MH370. We share your profound and prolonged grief, and deeply regret that we have not been able to locate the aircraft, nor those 239 souls on board that remain missing.\" \nHowever, the report said the understanding of where the plane may be is \"better now than it has ever been,\" partly as a result of studying debris that washed ashore in 2015 and 2016 which showed the plane was \"not configured for a ditching at the end-of-flight,\" meaning it had run out of fuel. Remembering the missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 \nThe search team also looked back at satellite imagery which showed objects in the ocean that may have been MH370 debris. The report said this analysis complemented work detailed in a 2016 review and identified an area of less than 25,000 square kilometers (9,650 square miles) \u2014 roughly the size of the U.S. state of Vermont \u2014 that \"has the highest likelihood of containing MH370.\" \nThe bureau noted the Malaysian government is \"continuing work on their investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the loss of MH370.\" \nThe search was extremely difficult because no transmissions were received from the aircraft after its first 38 minutes of flight. Systems designed to automatically transmit the flight's position failed to work after this point, the report said. \nSubsequent analysis of radar and satellite communication data revealed the aircraft had continued to fly for seven hours. Its last positively known position was fixed at the northern tip of Sumatra by surveillance systems operating that night, six hours before it ended its flight in the southern Indian Ocean. \nThe bureau said the search had at least led to some important gains in the field of locating missing aircraft on flights over deep ocean areas, with improvements made to systems for tracking aircraft. \n\"Steps are being taken to advance other aircraft systems including emergency locator transponders and flight recorder locator beacons,\" the report said. \nATSB Chief Commissioner Greg Hood praised the commitment of everyone involved in the search. \n\"This was an unprecedented endeavor and there has been an extraordinary response from the global community,\" he said in a statement.

That\u2019s what I did, that\u2019s how that worked out and helped me.\u201d \nNow a first-time All-Star, the 23-year-old Severino clearly is the right choice to take the ball Tuesday night in this do-or-die game against the Twins. He has been the Yankees\u2019 most effective starter all season, with barely a few blips, even if one of those was a three-inning stint against the Twins on Sept. 20, his lone start against them in his career. \nJust as homegrown star Aaron Judge emphatically expunged any bad taste lingering from his underwhelming debut late last summer, Severino came back from a lengthy trip to the minors and a stint as a one-inning reliever upon returning to not only reclaim his role in the starting rotation this spring, but to zoom to the top of it by tweaking his delivery and relying more on his changeup as a complementary pitch to his high-90s heat. \nIf a first-ballot Hall of Famer you idolized as a child suggests that you make those changes, you make them, right? \nNow several months later, we will see if Pedro\u2019s pupil can vault the Yanks past the upstart Twins and advance to the AL division series against Cleveland. Luis Severino has become the Yankees' ace after an offseason full of adjustments under the tutelage of Pedro Martinez. (Kathy Willens/AP) \n\u201cI feel very confident. I\u2019m not nervous,\u201d Severino said. \u201cWe have a great team, great bullpen, great guys over there. Our team is going to be good. \n\u201cIt means a lot to me (to start this game)\u2026They trust me, they gave me more confidence to go over there, okay, that\u2019s my team. So I have to do everything I can to get us to the next step.\u201d \nThe next step would be such a significant one for Severino, Judge, Gary Sanchez and rest of the young core of a franchise that for decades has solely based its definition of success by wins in October and championship rings. \nIt starts, as these things always tend to do, with the man with the ball in his hand. \n\u201cJust what he\u2019s done all year,\u201d Judge replied when asked what he expects to see Tuesday night from his ace teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s been dominant. He\u2019s attacking hitters. He\u2019s always getting in the good counts. Every time I look up there, it\u2019s always 0-1, 0-2. He\u2019s never falling behind a lot of hitters. \n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got his repertoire, and his stuff and you\u2019re getting ahead of guys like that, good things will happen.\u201d \nSo many impressive and encouraging things have happened where Severino is concerned throughout 2017. \nAnd he hardly seems intimidated by his matchup with veteran Ervin Santana, another countryman he got to know when they were All-Star teammates earlier this summer. Pedro Martinez used to be one of the Yankees' biggest rivals, but now fans should be thanking him. (Adam Glanzman/Getty Images) \nJoe Girardi certainly isn\u2019t surprised after watching how Severino responded to starts toward the end of the season against the likes of Cleveland ace Corey Kluber and Boston ace Chris Sale, perhaps the only two pitchers ahead of him for AL Cy Young consideration this season. \n\u201cI think the month of September, there are moments of anxiety, and I think he\u2019s pitched well down the stretch,\u201d Girardi said. \nIndeed, Severino went 3-0 with a 2.10 ERA over his final five starts, even if the lone shaky outing came against Minnesota on Sept. 20 at the Stadium. \n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a one-game playoff, and you\u2019re going to come with your best. He\u2019s the best on their team, and we\u2019re looking forward to it,\u201d Twins star Joe Mauer said. \u201cWe know what he\u2019s got. He\u2019s got good stuff, and we know it will be a tough day.\u201d \nSo tough that Minnesota skipper Paul Molitor even invoked an apt Hall of Fame-level comparison. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can go up there trying to hit all three of his pitches, because that\u2019s usually not a good mix,\u201d Molitor said. \u201cA guy that was comparable for me in his prime was Pedro.\u201d \nWho\u2019s your daddy? Perhaps \u201cThank you, Pedro\u201d should be the new chant at the Stadium if Severino pitches to form on Tuesday night.

Ask the Detroit Lions Ask the Detroit Lions how much it costs to kneel Members of the Lions kneel during the anthem prior to their game against the Falcons on Sept. 24. (Duane Burleson/AP) Tuesday, October 3, 2017, 7:59 AM \nThe Detroit Lions are 3-1, and currently in first place in the NFC North. \nESPN even listed the Lions as one of the biggest surprises of the season due to their defense forcing almost as many turnovers (11) in the first four games of this season than they had all last year (14). \nBut, something else is also going on in The Motor City. \nAccording to the Detroit Free Press , team owner Martha Ford asked her players not to kneel during the national anthem during a team meeting last week. \nFord's request, however, isn't what's most interesting here. It's the backstory to this situation and her motives that are the most intriguing. \nAccording to Lions officials, before Donald Trump's remarks about the NFL and national anthem protest, no player on the roster had taken part in any kind of anthem protest all last year. But on Sept. 24, the Sunday after Trump's tweets in which he called those kneeling sons of b----es, eight players took a knee during the anthem, while Ford stood on the sidelines with her arms linked with the rest of the team, in a show of unity and solidarity. \nThat Sunday was also when Rico LaVelle sang the anthem in Detroit and took a knee while raising his fist in the Black Power salute as he belted out the final note. \nThat was the backstory. \nHere's the motive. \nMoney. \nFord told her players that she was willing to cut a check and donate her name and money to any of the community issues that were at the core of the player's cause for kneeling. \nWith that news, only two players decided to kneel this past Sunday. One of them was Steve Longa, whose father was struck by a car and killed last week. \nThere's also the case of Akeem Spence, who was one of the players who kneeled before the Falcons game, but then decided to stand on Sunday. Martha Ford reportedly asked Lions players to stand for the anthem. (Jose Juarez/AP) \nSpence's father lost a contract job over his decision to kneel. \nMoney matters. \nAnd that's the complicated thing about this entire situation. If Ford does live up to her word, then her dollars could be put to good use, because what community program or non-profit doesn't need more cash? \nHowever, words also matter. \nAnd Ford used some words that make her gesture seem phony. \n\"I don't think it's a cure-all kind of thing, but it's a step in the right direction and then for somebody as powerful as her to say to come in and say she'll stand up and she'll back and put her name on whatever it is that we want to do, whatever it is that we want to attack, try to bring some real change about for the issues, to me that's big,\" said Lions defensive end Cornelius Washington. \nPay attention to when Washington said, \"put her name on whatever.\" \n\"We do dance around the topic a lot and Mrs. Ford has come forward and said that as long as we compromise as a team and unify and make a unified demonstration, she'll back us financially. So I'm definitely going to hold her to her word,\" said Lions running back Ameer Abdullah, who took a knee for the anthem before the Falcons game. Abdullah stood last Sunday. \nCompromise. \nIf Ford really wants to make a difference by donating to causes to address police brutality, systemic racism, and inequality, then why does her name have to be \"all over it?\" \nAnd why do people of color always have to compromise their voice when they want to address their concerns for humanity and equality? \nMartha Ford doesn't want to help, she wants to hush. Lions players stand and link arms during the anthem prior to a game against the Vikings. (Brad Rempel/USA Today Sports) \nAccording to CNN , the Department of Defense spent $6.8 million on \"paid patriotism\" between 2012 and 2015 amongst 50 teams from the NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS, and NASCAR. \nMind you, besides 9/11 and the Super Bowl, teams in the NFL weren't mandated to be on the field for the national anthem until 2009. \nMoney is in play, yet again. \nCheck this out from an article on ThinkProgress.com. \n\"Overall, the Defense Department spent at least $10.4 million on 'marketing and advertising contracts with professional sports teams' across the board between 2012 and 2015, although, the report noted, the department '[could not] accurately account' for the full number of contracts and payouts it had awarded. 'It only reported 62 percent (76 of 122) of its contracts and 70 percent ($7.3 million) of its spending in its response to our inquiry,\" wrote Arizona Senators Jeff Flake(R) and John McCain (R). \n\"Even with that disclosure, it is hard to understand how a team accepting taxpayer funds to sponsor a military appreciation game, or to recognize wounded warriors or returning troops, can be construed as anything other than paid patriotism.\" \nI never knew patriotism had a dollar amount. \nBut wait, there's more. \nThe article goes on to say that the NFL announced in May 2016 that it would refund $724,000 of the Defense Department payouts, which had been awarded for military \"appreciate activities.\" \nThe NFL has shown once again that money is its motive, and that they'd rather cut a check to be a patriot, then to do the actual work of one. \nNow, players inside of the Lions locker room, and as I suspect, others from around the league, are now being forced to answer some serious internal questions. \nHow much is taking a knee worth? \nAnd is that price high enough to allow you to sleep at night?

In total, there are 40 stories \u2014 one for each year since the movie's 1977 release \u2014 from a total of 43 authors.\nMany longtime \"Star Wars\" readers will see this as the new version of the classic \"Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina\" collection of short stories. While it does include stories from several cantina characters, this book is much more ambitious in that it follows the events of \"A New Hope\" from the final moments of \"Rogue One\" right to the throne room celebration following the Battle of Yavin.\n'Star Wars: Phasma' author Delilah S. Dawson talks love of Ewoks \n\u201cStar Wars: From a Certain Point of View\u201d is clever celebration of the original movie\u2019s 40th anniversary. (Penguin Random House) With each story comes a new tone and a fresh writing style, mirroring the many shades of the \"Star Wars\" franchise. There are plenty of bold stylistic choices, so readers will continually be surprised as they jump between rebels, Imperials and a wide variety of characters on the periphery of the main conflict.\nOf course, some stories are stronger and more memorable; standouts include those written by Gary Whitta, Claudia Gray, Pablo Hidalgo, Madeleine Roux, Alexander Freed, Gary D. Schmidt, Cavan Scott and Charles Soule.\nThe biggest joy of this collection is turning the page to a new story and realizing which character they'll be jumping to next. Readers who go in knowing as little as possible about the book's contents will have the best experience.\nStar Wars: WATN? Fans who know \"A New Hope\" by heart and those who've been keeping up with the comics and novels of recent years will be delighted by some of the inclusions \u2014 many of the stories feature side characters that have been quoted endlessly for four decades.\n\u2018Star Wars Battlefront II: Inferno Squad\u2019: book review \nHowever, the collection isn't without its problems. There are a few too many stories set on Tatooine and the tales focusing on the rebel pilots assaulting the Death Star occasionally become repetitive, since they are centered on similar narrative beats. The latter issue can be offset by taking breaks between stories.\nOverall, this collection makes great use of the rich side characters of \"A New Hope,\" strengthening the links between the original \"Star Wars\" movie and many of the stories told in the decades since.\nFans who attend the 40th anniversary panel at New York Comic Con or the Del Rey Booth on the convention floor can get a special edition of the book, with exclusive cover art by Chris Trevis.

Trump has habitually publicized unconfirmed information about the suspects and pushed some of his favored policies, such as his travel ban on majority-Muslim countries, only hours after other massacres. \nTrump vowed as a candidate and President to fight any serious restrictions on the Second Amendment, and there is little reason so far to believe the Las Vegas rampage will change his mind. \nTrump took in more than $30 million in campaign donations from the NRA and told the gun lobby at its national conference in April that he would end the left-wing \u201cassault\u201d on gun rights.

Cuomo said that many of the island's hospitals are operating on generators running short on supplies. \nThe state medical community on Tuesday was shipping out about $500,000 worth of equipment and supplies like bandages, Cuomo said. \nIn addition, they are readying to deploy about 100 doctors and 200 nurses to the island to offer assistance. \n\"For the hospital and the medical community to be making this gesture now is really significant, because the medical community itself is under a lot of pressure,\" Cuomo said, citing a series of proposed and enacted federal funding cuts. \"Even in the midst of this, you see this show of tremendous generosity.\" \nCuomo said Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello requested the medical supplies and personnel. \nThe UJA was providing the transportation and the unions representing nurses and other health care personnel were putting together the people who will be going down, the governor said. Hurricane Maria strikes Puerto Rico after pummeling Caribbean \nNew York previously sent state troopers and other emergency personnel to Puerto Rico in the wake of the storm that left the island without power, phones or running water. \nCuomo said the biggest impediment once the supplies reach the island is distributing them because of washed out and blocked roads and the need for personnel who know the layout of the island. \nTuesday\u2019s shipments from New York come the same day President Trump was scheduled to visit Puerto Rico for the first time since it was hit by Hurricane Maria. \nCuomo, who has been mentioned as a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, criticized Trump for waiting too long. Cuomo traveled to Puerto Rico on Sept. 22, \n\"I think it's good that he's going there now, but I think it would have better if he had gone there earlier,\" Cuomo said Tuesday. \"My first rule is show up. Show up because there's a human dynamic to this ... People are frightened and they're alone and they're anxious and they're wondering what's going to happen.\" \nCuomo said had Trump gone earlier, he could have avoided the political fights that have occurred. Trump got into a dispute with the mayor of San Juan over the federal relief efforts. Cuomo said Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello requested the medical supplies and personnel. (Gerald Herbert/AP) \n\"Showing up when you're in a position of power \u2014 you're President of the United States \u2014 would give such a reassurance to the community.

The unfortunates left behind can at least lord over the \u201cskin-jobs\u201d who serve them.\nShows, premieres canceled after Las Vegas shooting \nAnd no one does more lording than Jared Leto as the head of the corporation at the top of the new world order. There are few flaws to be found in this sci-fi-high, but putting the Oscar winner in a one-note role is sadly one of them.\nRyan Gosling and Harrison Ford, who reprises the role of Rick Deckard from the 1982 \"Blade Runner.\" (Stephen Vaughan/Alcon Entertainment, LLC) Between cases, K lives a lonely existence, with only a Siri-like hologram girlfriend (Ana De Armas) for company...until he discovers a secret on a cold case that threatens their \u201cworld built on a wall separated by kind.\u201d\nThat sets him off on a quest to find answers \u2014 and the one man who can provide them, former blade runner Rick Deckard, with Harrison Ford reprising his role from the original.\nK (Ryan Gosling, right) lives a lonely existence, with only a Siri-like hologram for a girlfriend (Ana De Armas). (Courtesy of Alcon Entertainment) While it\u2019s truly special to accompany Ford on his trip down memory lane \u2014 Han Solo in \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d and his whip-cracking archeologist in \u201cIndiana Jones V\u201d whenever that starts filming \u2014 he has ceded leading man status to Gosling. And the younger actor earns every bit of his screen time with an understated performance and solid action chops.\nBut the real heroes of the film are behind the camera. Villeneuve, who proved his flair for genre grandeur with last year\u2019s \u201cArrival,\u201d and director of photography Roger A. Deakins have crafted a masterpiece to watch \u2014 whether in the cyan neon bathed streets of Los Angeles or in an orange bathed dusty desert wasteland. And like all of the French-Canadian director\u2019s films, it sounds great.\nJared Leto plays the head of the corporation at the top of the new world order. (Stephen Vaughan) With original \u201cBlade Runner\u201d producer Ridley Scott attached, there are homages to the first film without being overly reverential. Good thing. Because this sequel eclipses that adaptation of Philip K. Dick\u2019s novel, \u201cDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\u201d \u2014 which suffered from compromises made for the studio at the time.\nThe screenplay by Hampton Fancher (who co-wrote the original) and Michael Green give plenty of class war themes to chew on over the film\u2019s two-hour and 43-minute running time. That might have been a little too long considering how over-baked the sequel\u2019s third act feels towards the end. But that\u2019s a small price to pay for the rest of the movie.\nDo androids dream of electric sheep? Maybe. But science fiction-loving cinephiles have definitely been dreaming of a movie like \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d for years.\nTags: ryan gosling denis villeneuve blade runner 2049 harrison ford Send a

NEWS Updated:   5:47 PM \nSubway riders are now reminded of the negativity that comes with being a Knicks fan on the same day the team's preseason starts. \nA Fox Sports 1 ad campaign is asking riders to \"pick a side\" on the Times Square to Grand Central shuttle: Are the Knicks hopeful or hopeless? \nBut the ad wrap, which went up Monday, is now being shut down at FS1's request, according to a spokesperson for the MTA's advertising partner Outfront Media. \nHalf of the train has a negative ad on the outside, referring to the franchise as \"hopeless\" alongside photos of Joakim Noah and Tim Hardaway Jr. It's never too early for Knicks fans to start feeling negative about the franchise, apparently. (Jake Becker/New York Daily News) \nNoah signed a four-year, $72 million contract last year and has been widely viewed as a bust for the franchise so far. Hardaway Jr. turned several heads this offseason when the Knicks signed him to a huge four-year, $71 million deal. \nOn the inside of the subway car, even the seats are filled with negative quotes. Knicks fans asked to 'pick a side' with FS1's subway ad campaign \nSide by side are seats with \"Sit here if you blame Phil,\"\"Sit here if you blame Melo,\" and \"Sit here if you blame Dolan.\" \nBut it wasn't all negative \u2014 the other side of the car featured \"hopeful\" along with a picture of star Kristaps Porzingis. \nKristaps Porzingis ready to live up to expectations with Knicks \nStill, the campaign apparently ruffled some feathers at nearby Madison Square Garden. The Knicks were not initially aware of the ads, ESPN reported . \nAnother car included similar messaging but instead took aim at Giants QB Eli Manning and Yankees star rookie Aaron Judge. Pick a seat, Knicks fans. (Jake Becker/New York Daily News) \n\"Swings hard, misses often,\" read one seat critical of Judge, while one on the other side read, \"He can be the LeBron of baseball.\" \nMultiple attempts to reach Brian Strong, who is FS1's Senior VP of Brand Communications, went unanswered. \nAaron Judge also earned some real estate on the shuttle. \nThe Knicks face the Nets at the Garden at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim hardaway jr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joakim noah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike g", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony gutierrez/ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex busch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared mintz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hardaway jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "knicks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "daily news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times square", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:14:37.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d998c69e4eae10b388a3db50d0dd699cee0f17e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jb8_3eTvkOFvvKh9O4ZlRmTAUplPSaMsbfS.gRMH13_H7QAh3SD2wOJ7J1it87.cSfwxA04QLp8RzPALWvYcxNCxg3YOAG8R6QIyUPGXkpAchzly6P0WevTIYXXUQcPleuYMHEcl0AMM-", "site_full": "www.nydailynews.com", "site": "nydailynews.com", "site_section": "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/islanders/index_rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYDN Rss Article only", "title": "Mets dump pitching coach Dan Warthen, head trainer Ray Ramirez", "title_full": "Mets dump pitching coach Dan Warthen, head trainer Ray Ramirez", "published": "2017-10-03T16:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3538244.1507038894!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/mets4s-1-web.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 811, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 181, "comments": 0, "shares": 181}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d998c69e4eae10b388a3db50d0dd699cee0f17e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jb8_3eTvkOFvvKh9O4ZlRmTAUplPSaMsbfS.gRMH13_H7QAh3SD2wOJ7J1it87.cSfwxA04QLp8RzPALWvYcxNCxg3YOAG8R6QIyUPGXkpAchzly6P0WevTIYXXUQcPleuYMHEcl0AMM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "KRISTIE ACKERT", "published": "2017-10-03T16:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mets dump pitching coach Dan Warthen, head trainer Ray Ramirez", "text": "The Mets continued the shakeup of their major-league staff Tuesday, firing pitching coach Dan Warthen and head trainer Ray Ramirez. They will reorganize their medical/training staff and minor-league staff as well, Sandy Alderson said in a conference call with reporters.\nThe Mets GM added that Kevin Long will get \"strong consideration\" in an interview to replace Terry Collins as manager. Alderson said the Mets are in the process of gathering other candidates as well.\n\"Kevin Long has expressed an interest in interviewing for the manager's position and that will certainly be given strong consideration,\" Alderson said. \"I do believe that ultimately, depending on the managerial choice, that both (Long and assistant hitting coach Pat Roessler) will be back.\n\"As far as managerial candidates are concerned, we do not have a final list. We have a preliminary list,\" Alderson said. \" We will be fine-tuning that over the next few days and commence the process.\"\nThat list includes Alderson allies Bob Geren, who served as Mets bench coach before leaving in 2016 to take the same job with the Dodgers, and Chip Hale, the current A's third base coach who lost out on the job to Collins in 2010.\nBut Alderson was emphatic that he does not have to be familiar with the candidate.\n\"No, my familiarity with the candidate is not necessary,\" Alderson said. \"In fact, I am intrigued by some of the names that have come up whom I've never met.\"\nMETS 2017 KEEP 'EM or DUMP 'em: VOTE NOW \nDan Warthen, Mets pitching coach since 2008, will not return to the organization. (David Zalubowski/AP) The list also includes former Met and White Sox manager Robin Ventura, former Met and current White Sox bench coach Joe McEwing and former Met and current Astros bench coach Alex Cora.\nThat new manager will have \"input,\" but will not necessarily make the decision on the new pitching coach. Alderson cited Warthen's friendship with Collins as well as the poor pitching \u2014 starters and bullpen \u2014 this year.\nWarthen ends a 10-year run in that position that included guiding R.A. Dickey to a Cy Young, Jacob deGrom to a 2014 Rookie of the Year award and a staff of young arms to the World Series in 2015 and back to the playoffs in 2016.\nHe has been offered another position in the organization, but Alderson said Warthen had not yet told him if he accepted the still-undefined role in the organization.\nThat offer may be an attempt to ease the concern of pitchers like Jacob deGrom, who said he saw \"no reason to change,\" and Noah Syndergaard, who ended the 2017 season with a parting shot to the front office.\n\"As far as pitching coach situation, I think it's pretty much b-lls--t with Dan. He's taking the blame for all the injuries we've had this year,\" Syndergaard said Sunday.\nThe injuries were overwhelming, so it's not surprising Ramirez took the fall.\nRay Ramirez (right) has also been sacked. (Drew Hallowell/Getty Images) Alderson said that moves made \"midseason\" already started the restructuring of the team\u2019s medical/training staff. The Mets will add some staff and work to improve the communication between them, the front office and field staff.\n\"Adding personnel also means reorganizing areas of responsibility and reporting all toward the view of making sure the front office and the baseball staff have current meaningful information,\" Alderson said. \"And that the players are getting the best possible care.\"\nAlderson doubled down on controversial trainer Mike Barwis, saying he is an asset to the organization who is not involved in the day-to-day maintenance of players.\n\"Barwis is a consultant, he's a tremendously knowledgeable about physiology, anatomy and performance therapy and performance conditioning,\" Alderson said. \"He doesn't dictate to players what they are going to do or not do.\"\nBesides injuries, the Mets\u2019 other main issue is that they do not have a stockpile of good young players. They were not happy with how shortstop prospect Amed Rosario, first base Dominic Smith and some young pitchers came up to the majors looking unprepared.\n\"I was disappointed with how some of our young players performed over the course of a few weeks. I am glad we got a look at them, but in some cases there is work to be done,\" Alderson said. \"There are going to be changes at our Triple-A affiliate, in fact, I think major changes. We're taking a hard look at the rest of our player development system as well.\"\nAlderson sees Collins, who stepped down as manager after Sunday's season finale, as someone who can help get the minor-league system in order. He has the title of special assistant to the GM.  \nTags: new york mets mlb dan warthen ray ramirez tom goodwin ricky bones Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ray ramirez", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dan warthen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kevin long", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy alderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warthen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ray ramirez dan warthen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramirez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom goodwin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glenn sherlock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricky bones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david zalubowski/ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat roessler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john ricco", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mets", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:22:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b08364ed4f496b061a56714262c4cf7a952184f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jmHAS0QL2agHEF.rKkMCqjNYxp3YhKp3X3OAVgHPLzIfwVtzZEpOZtCEwsHfpN7WL4Pn9C3PCCWrsPQTQDc5OOtQDGzDwkcvtVAlygmdHNCO.ug6NIwnQcUmALKFl3jPT9Jwf74.bLO4nl4_8dDDjCbBKxWRp9KF3s1IE6XLDysRW0n.R1CPHwoPzWREJiOiNaeEvRrJQs9kzo0MKrnM5pm3xk2KXz6sG", "site_full": "www.nydailynews.com", "site": "nydailynews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.nydailynews.com/nydnrss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top News", "title": "Three dead in double murder-suicide in Florida", "title_full": "Three dead in double murder-suicide in Florida - NY Daily News", "published": "2017-10-03T18:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3538264.1507039602!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/sarasota4n-1-web.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 811, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 489, "comments": 0, "shares": 489}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c250fe99482a6098329d9701b389ac4c2faeec6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jmHAS0QL2agHEF.rKkMCqjNYxp3YhKp3X3OAVgHPLzIfwVtzZEpOZtCEwsHfpN7WL4Pn9C3PCCWrsPQTQDc5OOuf4uhfXKk3m", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Boroff", "published": "2017-10-03T18:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Three dead in double murder-suicide in Florida", "text": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, October 3, 2017, 10:08 AM \nThree people are dead from apparent gunshot wounds and another was critically wounded in a double murder-suicide in Florida late Monday night. \nDeputies were called to the scene in Nokomis just after 11 p.m. and found five people, according to the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office.

Natalee Holloway has been missing since 2005. (AP) \n\"The mitochondrial DNA bone sample was not a match to [mother] Beth Holloway,\" he told Oxygen . \"And so it was ruled out as being Natalee Holloway.\" \nKolowski said out of the four bone samples discovered earlier this year by Natalee's father Dave Holloway and private investor T.J. Ward, only one was human. \nNatalee Holloway missing for 10 years as family awaits news \nAccording to Dr. Kolowski, the identity of the person whose DNA was tested remains unknown. \n\"We don't know if the person is male or female,\" he said. \"We don't know how old that person is.

I thought, you know, there may be something to this.\" \nNatalee was 18 when she vanished during a trip with friends to Aruba in 2005 to celebrate graduating high school.

(Karel Navarro/AP) \nThe teen was last seen with Joran van der Sloot outside a tourist bar. \nVan der Sloot has long been the prime suspect but has never been charged in Natalee's disappearance due to a lack of evidence.

Parents feel the same way.\u201d \nUnlike many other prestigious high schools, Finance and Enterprise does not require students to take an admissions test. Instead, the school offers 15 open houses throughout the fall and winter that allow prospective students to check it out, talk to the faculty and see if they feel the academy is the right fit for them. \n\u201cI do that to really allow the community to see our school environment,\u201d Armano said. \u201cWe have kids coming from all the five boroughs of New York City. We have freshmen, sophomores, juniors presenting the school to the parents.\u201d \nThe sessions conclude with a meeting with all of the parents. \n\u201cI bring (them) to a room and provide them with all the information about what high school is,\u201d Armano said. \u201cWhat are the things you need to be able to do as a parent to sustain the four years and make sure your children are prepared for college?\u201d \nThe school remains highly selective.

The academy is small \u2014 its current enrollment is 613 students. \nFor struggling students, there are after-school sessions every Tuesday between 2:40 p.m. and 3:55 p.m. to give the kids and their parents an opportunity to meet with teachers and discuss the issues. \nThe school also offers job-shadowing programs and paid internships as well as accounting, finance and entrepreneurship classes. \n\u201cWe want them to see the world they\u2019re going to face,\u201d Armano said. \nRisk-taking is key to students' development within NEST+m school \nThat entails meeting heads of companies to learn what it takes to make it to the top. \n\u201cIf you want to succeed, you need to start from the bottom, but you will be able to get there,\u201d she said. \nJessica Herrera, a school guidance counselor, said one of the keys to success is how well all the staff works together. \n\u201cIt\u2019s teamwork,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to retain our teachers and it\u2019s not a revolving door every year.

Every time I see those kids and I look into their eyes, I think of myself when I was a child coming to this country. \n\u201cThe same hope, the same drive that I have every day is the same drive that I want our children to have so they can be successful.

must select and apply to their favorites in the annual high school admissions process.\nThe options can be daunting: technical programs, early college classes and schools focusing on every conceivable subject, from sports management to airplane mechanics, medical forensics, performing arts, law, culinary arts and even museums.\nHow we ranked the top New York City high schools \nThe Daily News\u2019 annual guide to the city\u2019s top high schools \u2014 in conjunction with U.S. News & World Report \u2014 aims to demystify the process and offer a selection of some of the city\u2019s best offerings.\nThe first thing families should do is educate themselves on the range of high schools that are available to city students, said Sandy Ferguson, deputy CEO of the city Education Department\u2019s Office of Student Enrollment.\nWith an international community from almost 50 countries, speaking over 40 languages, Marble Hill High School for International Studies focuses on global awareness and cross-cultural communication. (James Keivom/New York Daily News) \u201cThe most exciting thing about high school admissions is the incredible range of choices,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place else in the world where a kid\u2019s interests and talents and needs can be met so completely. There\u2019s just such a huge range of options.\u201d\nThe first thing to consider is what the student wants to study, Ferguson said \u2014 and then look for it.\nMarble Hill High School crafts futures for international students \n\u201cA kid can leave our high schools with a certification as an airplane mechanic. They can go into the food industry and study with some of the great names in the culinary arts,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThey can learn to build, to design and pursue the career of their choice.\u201d\nIncoming city freshmen may apply to up to 12 high schools. Ferguson said families will be most likely to match with a chosen school if they apply to the limit of a full dozen schools and make sure to rank them in order of preference.\nThe city holds two application rounds each year using a computer algorithm that considers students\u2019 preferences and qualifications. Roughly 90% of students get a match in round one. Those who don\u2019t must go on to the second round.\nAdmissions methods vary. Some high schools give preference to certain geographical areas, or to students who come from lower grades at sister schools.\nBrooklyn\u2019s School for Criminal Justice empowers young women \nUrban Assembly School for Criminal Justice ranks as one of the city's top schools. (Debbie Egan-Chin/New York Daily News) The city\u2019s specialized high schools admit students solely on the basis of scores from a single test. Other schools admit students who possess demonstrable talent in the arts.\nMany schools use some combination of academic achievement, test scores and attendance history to weigh admissions.\nThe city\u2019s privately run, publicly funded charter schools, which enroll more than 104,000 students across all grades, employ a random lottery to select students, usually giving preference to their home district.\nStudents may apply to as many charter schools as they wish.\nRisk-taking is key to students' development within NEST+m school \nFerguson said students and their families can begin the high school selection process as early as seventh grade by talking with guidance counselors and studying the options.\nThe Education Department has an enrollment hotline \u2014 (718) 935-2399 \u2014 and also operates enrollment centers in all five boroughs for extra help and questions.\nFrank Sinatra School of the Arts is located in Long Island City, Queens.

(Debbie Egan-Chin/New York Daily News) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, October 3, 2017, 11:22 AM \nBrooklyn\u2019s Urban Assembly School for Criminal Justice offers more than just a typical high-school education to its students. \nThe all-girls school was created with a special emphasis on criminal justice. But over the past 10 years since the school began, its focus has changed, founding Principal Mariela Graham said. \nToday, the 560-student school aims to prepare students for college with a liberal arts education featuring a healthy dose of feminism. \nA growing number of girls from conservative Muslim families attend the school, which serves grades 6-12, Graham said, and the single-sex classes empower them. \nRisk-taking is key to students' development within NEST+m school \n\u201cAt the time that we opened, an all-girls school seemed like an intriguing option,\u201d said Graham, who\u2019s worked in city schools since 2002. \u201cAnd I liked the idea of taking students in grade six, and saying, \u2018We\u2019ll be your home from now until college.\u2019\u201d \nBut the principal said that in recent years about half the kids in the school come from South Asian countries, such as Pakistan, and some of their families are so devout that the girls might not attend public school if they weren\u2019t offered an all-girls option. \nFor many of those young women, said Graham, going away to college wasn\u2019t even a fantasy. But now more of them are going away to school after graduation, she said. \nSchools reflect the communities they serve as well as the educators who operate them, Graham said. The very best schools, she said, are able to change when needed to suit the needs of their students and families, whatever they may be. The Urban Assembly School for Criminal Justice. (Debbie Egan-Chin/New York Daily News) \nAt the School for Criminal Justice, Graham decided that rather than focusing on law and order, she\u2019d make more of a difference by focusing on getting girls to college. \n\u201cIt\u2019s blossomed into something a lot more than I\u2019d ever known it would be,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of empowerment.\u201d \nWith 46% of the schools\u2019 students coming from conservative South Asian backgrounds, Graham makes a special effort to build trust with families starting as early as possible. \nThe point, she said, is to convince parents that college is a beneficial option for their daughters. \nDe Blasio, Fari\u00f1a hear parent fears after Bronx school stabbing \nIt\u2019s not easy. Many parents think that college is unsafe for girls and that a university education probably isn\u2019t helpful for them anyway. \nBut Graham and the dedicated staff persist, teaching girls about female empowerment with a feminist literature class that\u2019s required of all ninth-graders.

They were able to make their way to a triage tent, where the came across Dean McAuley, an off-duty firefighter from Washington. \nHe evaluated her injury as she started to go into shock and remained with her throughout the night. Mourners pay tribute to victims of Las Vegas massacre \n\u201cHe could have not acknowledged me in that tent. He was just a volunteer that was taking his time out of that night and saving people\u2019s lives, and he didn\u2019t have to but he is a very strong man and his family should be very proud of what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Natalia said. \nShe\u2019s currently in stable condition, but the bullet shattered inside her body and punctured her lung, according to the news station. She\u2019ll likely need surgery. Her sister was hospitalized and is back home after being released on Monday. \n30 concertgoers hid in freezer during Las Vegas shooting \nMcAuley recorded a video message to Natalia, sending her well wishes and praising her bravery in the face of chaos. \n\u201cI am very proud of you and your strength and your ability to stay calm,\u201d he told her. \u201cI hope someday we can reconnect and I can give you a big hug.\u201d Off-duty firefighter Dean McAuley helped the twins survive the deadly shooting. (GMA) \nThe teens are among more than 500 injured in Sunday\u2019s deadly shooting , which also left another 59 dead. The gunman has been identified as Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old retired accountant who\u2019d been living in a Nevada retirement community. \nAuthorities said he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

(Rob Grabowski/Rob Grabowski/Invision/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, October 3, 2017, 12:21 PM \nLate rock icon Tom Petty once admitted he wished he hadn't featured a Confederate flag at past concerts \u2014 30 years after he prominently displayed the controversial Southern symbol throughout his 1985 tour. \nThe Gainesville, Fla., native \u2014 who died Monday at 66, a day after going into cardiac arrest \u2014 told Rolling Stone in 2015 that he regretted using the flag during shows on his \"Southern Accents\" tour, contending he was \"ignorant\" about its true meaning. \nSome look at the flag, which was flown by the South during the Civil War, as a symbol of racism. \n\"The Confederate flag was the wallpaper of the South when I was a kid growing up in Gainesville, Florida. I always knew it had to do with the Civil War, but the South had adopted it as its logo,\" he told the music outlet shortly after South Carolina officials opted to remove the flag from their statehouse. \nTom Petty\u2019s death draws attention to dangers of cardiac arrest \n\"I was pretty ignorant of what it actually meant. It was on a flagpole in front of the courthouse and I often saw it in Western movies,\" he continued. \"I just honestly didn't give it much thought, though I should have.\" \nPetty, who supported South Carolina's decision to take down the Confederate flag, said he used the flag as a marketing tool for the tour since it was meant to accompany his album about the South, also called \"Southern Accents.\" Tom Petty wears a Confederate flag hat in the \u201cSouthern Accents\u201d documentary in 1985. (youtube) \nHe explained that a song on the album titled \"Rebels\" was about a Southerner who had adopted views from his forefathers. Petty felt at the time, he said, that the Confederate flag served as a representation of that created character. \n\"I wish I had given it more thought,\" he said of using the flag on the tour. \"It was a downright stupid thing to do.\" \nTom Petty dead at 66 after going into cardiac arrest \nPetty also told the outlet that in 1987 he asked audience members to stop wearing Confederate garb to his concerts. \n\"I noticed people in the audience wearing Confederate flag bandanas and things like that. One night, someone threw one onstage. I stopped everything and gave a speech about it. I said, 'Look, this was to illustrate a character. This is not who we are. Having gone through this, I would prefer it if no one would ever bring a Confederate flag to our shows again because this isn't who we are.'\" Remembering the iconic life and career of Tom Petty \nHe said he never saw a Confederate flag in his audience again. \nPetty's longtime manager confirmed his death on Monday night. The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer racked up three Grammy wins and 18 total nominations over the course of his legendary career.

The difference, of course, between Oswald and Paddock is that the weaponry has become more expensive and sophisticated as our country has become this kind of killing field, at Sandy Hook Elementary and the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and Virginia Tech University and now an outdoor concert in Las Vegas where 59 are assassinated and more than 500 are injured.\nVegas gunman possibly used add-on to make rifle almost automatic \nAnd what we are once again supposed to believe, especially from members of Congress for whom any moment of silence at a terrible American moment like this is full of unintended irony and symbolism, that the answer is for them to do what they did after Sandy Hook and Virginia Tech and Orlando and all the others.

At least that\u2019s what Anthony Federico thinks may have happened. \nFederico, 33, the headline writer who was fired from ESPN in 2012 for making an offensive pun about former Knick Jeremy Lin has been born again as a Catholic priest. \n\u201cLooking back, I think God allowed this to happen to me to put me on a path to being a priest, a path that I was avoiding,\u201d Federico told the Washington Post . \u201cI\u2019ve never been happier.\u201d \nFive years ago, Federico penned the headline \u201cChink in the Armor\u201d atop a column about Lin. He claims it was an honest mistake, never meant to offend anyone, and realized soon after the story published the awful error he committed. \nLin has lunch with fired ESPN headline writer \nESPN received almost immediate blowback for the lapse in judgement. \n\u201cI went to the bathroom and vomited,\u201d Federico said of when he discovered his mistake . ESPN fired him soon after. \nFederico and Lin, who now plays for Brooklyn, had lunch after the incident and reportedly spoke mostly about religion. Lin is a Christian. The meeting set Federico on a completely different path, diverting far from sports journalism.

(Mohammed Abed/Pool Photo via AP) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Tuesday, October 3, 2017, 10:48 AM \nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 A new round of Palestinian reconciliation talks experienced its first sign of trouble on Tuesday as the Hamas militant group said it would not give up its vast weapons arsenal, putting it at odds with both the rival Fatah movement and Israel. \nThe tough comments by Hamas' supreme leader, Ismail Haniyeh, provided a reminder of the long road that lies ahead after this week's launch of talks with President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement. \nAbbas' prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, is in Gaza, where he has received a warm welcome in what is by far the most ambitious attempt by the Palestinian rivals to end a 10-year rift. But Hamdallah's visit is largely symbolic, and the negotiations on key sticking points, including the future of Hamas' military force, only start next week in Egypt. \nIn a TV interview, Haniyeh said his group, which has fought three wars with Israel, would never give up its armed struggle against the Jewish state. \n\"As long as there is occupation on the ground, our people have the right to possess weapons and resist the occupation with all forms of resistance,\" he told the private On TV station. \nIn a gesture to Abbas, he said Hamas will not go back to war against Israel unilaterally. \"We are ready to negotiate with the Palestinian factions and Fatah on unifying the decision of peace and war,\" he said. \nSuch concessions are unlikely to satisfy Abbas, who issued his own tough statement late Monday saying \"everything must be in the hands of the Palestinian Authority.\" \nHe said specifically he would not agree to reproduce the \"Hezbollah model\" of Lebanon, where the armed militant group acts freely under the watch of a weak central government. \nIsrael's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said his government will not accept a reconciliation deal between rival Palestinian factions that puts Israel at risk. Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah waves to the media as he arrives to head the Cabinet session in Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' former official resident in Gaza City, Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017. Hamdallah has held the first government meeting in the Gaza Strip as part of a major reconciliation effort to end the 10-year rift between Fatah and Hamas. (AP Photo/ Khalil Hamra) \nHe said any deal must include recognizing Israel, disbanding Hamas' military wing and cutting ties with Hamas' patron Iran. \n\"We are not prepared to accept bogus reconciliations\" in which the Palestinians reconcile \"at the expense of our existence,\" he said. \nA day after his festive arrival, Hamdallah held his first Cabinet meeting in Gaza on Tuesday in another symbolic step toward reconciliation. His Cabinet ministers were then to head to their local offices to meet with staffers. \nHamas, an Islamic militant group that seeks Israel's destruction, seized control of Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007, leaving the Palestinians divided between rival governments in territories located on opposite sides of Israel. The division has been a major obstacle to Palestinian hopes of establishing an independent state. \nWhile previous reconciliation attempts have failed, years of international isolation and steadily worsening conditions in Gaza have pushed Hamas toward compromise. \nThe real work begins next week in Cairo, where Egyptian mediators will host talks between the Palestinian rivals. There was no set time frame for the negotiations. \nEgyptian intelligence chief Khaled Fawzy arrived in Gaza on Tuesday to deliver a boost of support. It was the highest ranking Egyptian official to visit Gaza since 2007. \n\"I'm convinced that you are able to implement your promises for the benefit of your people,\" he said. \"I'm waiting for you in Cairo, your home, and you will do it and succeed. History will register that you have unified your people.\" Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, center, chairs a reconciliation government cabinet meeting in Gaza City Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017.

(Mohammed Abed/Pool Photo via AP) \nSeveral factors appear to be working in favor of reconciliation. \nUnder Hamas' watch, Gaza has fallen deeper into poverty, battered by a joint Israeli-Egyptian blockade and three devastating wars with Israel. Unemployment is estimated at over 40 percent, Gaza's 2 million residents are virtually barred from traveling abroad, and residents have electricity for only a few hours a day. \nHamas' newly elected leadership has said it prefers to return to the group's roots as a \"resistance\" movement battling Israel. \nAnd perhaps most critically, Hamas has improved relations with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who is poised to play a critical role as mediator. El-Sissi also has good ties with Israel and the U.S. and could help sell any deal to Netanyahu. \nIn a videotaped speech delivered by his intelligence chief, el-Sissi called the reconciliation efforts \"a historic day\" and praised the \"determination\" of the sides to reach an agreement. \n\"I sent the intelligence head to attend this occasion to emphasize that Egypt is eager to present all kinds of aid to accomplish the mission,\" he added. \nThe question now is whether that Egyptian offer of help will be enough to get the sides to soften their positions. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Bullets flew close to the rate of a machine gun, and much faster than the already lethal power of a semiautomatic rifle. \nAlthough federal laws bar automatic weapons, gun dealers are free to peddle the stocks despite their potential use for mass murder. \nHere are the stories of those victims gunned down in the Las Vegas massacre \nThe federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives approved the devices in 2010 even though one manufacturer, Texas-based Slide Fire Inc. claimed the purpose of the stocks was to assist \u201cpeople with limited mobility of the hands,\u201d records show. \n\u201cObviously, they know better. When it comes down to it, everything is about money,\u201d said Billy King, 38, who was shot in the back Sunday night in Sin City while shielding his wife. \u201cThe more they can get it sold, of course they\u2019re going to sell it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s like smoke shops. They carry certain glassware and say it\u2019s used for tobacco, but everyone knows most of the sales are for marijuana,\u201d said the married father of four from Las Vegas who is still hospitalized. A bump or slider stock is pictured attached to this firearm. The device allows a semi-automatic weapon to fire at a rate similar to an automatic. (Allen Breed/AP) \nHe was one of 527 people injured \u2014 either shot, or hurt in the ensuing chaos \u2014 as 22,000 people scurried for safety at a country music concert. \nMAP: Mass shootings in the United States since 2013 \nAri Freilich, the staff attorney for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, scoffed at Slide Fire\u2019s claim, saying the device has no redeeming qualities. \n\u201cIt has no defensive purpose or hunting utility,\u201d he said. \u201cIts purpose is purely offensive: to shoot as many bullets and kill as many people as possible in a short amount of time.\u201d \nPaddock pumped the bullets from his suite about 1,200 feet from the concert floor. \nThe shooter, who owned dozens of guns, apparently \u201cpreplanned extensively\u201d for the attack, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said. \nPaddock owned at least 47 guns purchased in four states. He had at least 23 weapons in his hotel room, mostly rifles, officials said. Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock used a bump to turn into a killing machine. (John Raoux/AP) \nTo put it in context, Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last year, fired 24 shots in nine seconds from a semiautomatic rifle. \nPaddock, using the bump stock, fired 90 shots in a 10-second period, close to the rate of a machine gun, which is 98 shots in seven seconds. \nBump stocks replace the factory stock on different types of rifles, including the AR-15- and AK-47-style guns used by Paddock, and function using the recoil of the rifles to accelerate the rate of fire. \nSEE IT: Look inside Stephen Paddock\u2019s room shows guns, shells \nThe shooter puts his or her finger just in front of the trigger while constantly pushing the rifle forward with the other hand. \nThe gun recoils after the first round goes off, literally bumping back into the stock, and then moves forward again from the pressure. \nOnline listings show the attachments typically sell for $100 to $300. Paddock fired onto a concert crowd from a window on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. \nSlide Fire calls its products a \u201cgame changer,\u201d and boasts, \u201cThe command and control behind the Slide Fire stock will create an exhilarating experience that keeps you smiling for days.\u201d \nGoFundMe for Las Vegas massacre victims raises more than $3.2M \nIt\u2019s not clear which company Paddock bought his stocks from. \nIn a 2010 letter written by a Justice Department lawyer, the Slide Fire bump stock, designed by Jeremiah Cottle, was approved for use. The lawyer, John Spencer, assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said in the letter that the company claimed its purpose was \u201cto assist persons whose hands have limited mobility.\u201d \nSix years later, however, Cottle gave a whole different description for the purpose of the device. \u201cSome people like drag racing, some people like skiing and some people, like me, love full auto,\u201d he told the Ammoland website. \n\u201cSlide Fire brings shooters the same full auto experience but without having to take out a second mortgage on their home.\u201d \nCottle has insisted over the years his device \u2014 despite the rapid fire it generates \u2014 does not create machine guns. Cops are investigating whether Paddock used the bump stock rifles in the massacre. (John Locher/AP) \n\u201cIt is not automatic.

(Machine Gun Vegas via YouTube) \n\u201cThere were many factors contributing to this tragic event, but there is no doubt that the shooter's ability to inflict so many casualties was heavily due to the types of weapons he had access to,\u201d reads a press release from Machine Gun Vegas. \n\u201cWe believe that responsible gun ownership is attainable through the application of common sense, more stringent vetting and background checks, dramatically increased mandatory sentencing for gun offences and increased testing standards for gun owners.\u201d \nAmong the experiences Machine Gun Vegas offers is an indoor SEAL Team 6 package that allows users to shoot like members of the elite Navy unit. Another package allows a party of three or less to fire 300 rounds from a helicopter for $2,999. \nMean Girls Day brings cast together to support Las Vegas victims \nHighlighting its arsenal is an M-134, better known as a mini-gun, which can fire 4,000 rounds per minute. \nThe range says it has the only one of its kind for public use in \u201cSin City,\u201d with the 100 rounds costing $199.

Once the shooting is done, guests are treated to burgers, fries and a soda. \nIts arsenal includes the AK-47 \u2014 one of the most popular guns in the world \u2014 along with a Barret .50-caliber rifle commonly used by military snipers.

Chargers are among the NFL\u2019s four current 0-4 teams. Manning and Rivers already were linked forever by the number four due to their dramatic \u201904 draft day swap, but they would rather dodge this connection with the digit:\nSunday\u2019s game will mark the first meeting of two NFL teams 0-4 or worse since \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 2004, per Elias Sports Bureau, when the 0-4 Bills defeated the 0-5 Dolphins, 20-13, on Oct. 17 in Buffalo.\nThe trade of Manning for Rivers, of course, changed the course of NFL history and occurred \u2014 when else \u2014 not on the 23rd or 25th but the 24th of April 2004. And the drama and theater that played out at The Theater at Madison Square Garden, not far from the bright lights of Broadway, was unforgettable and changed the courses of two franchises.\nGiants Insider: Marshall hasn't looked capable during 0-4 start \nIn 2004, Manning had told the Chargers he didn\u2019t want to play for them and would sit out the season if they picked him first overall. Chargers GM A.J. Smith drafted Manning anyway, already aware the Giants wanted Manning, having discussed a possible trade with Giants GM Ernie Accorsi the night before. And the Chargers liked the idea of drafting and dealing Manning because they didn\u2019t want him falling to the rival Raiders.\nAccorsi knew the Chargers liked Rivers, but he still entered draft day convinced he wasn\u2019t getting Manning because on Friday night, when he offered the Chargers a No. 1 pick swap and the Giants\u2019 No. 3 in 2004 No. 2 in 2005, Smith responded with demands that Accorsi called \u201cway too steep\u201d: the Giants\u2019 No. 1, 2 and 3 picks that Saturday, plus their No. 1 the following year and defensive end Osi Umenyiora.\nEli Manning holds a San Diego Chargers jersey after they selected him No. 1 overall in the 2004 NFL draft. (John Marshall Mantel/AP) A game of high-stakes chicken followed over the next 18 hours.\nAccorsi wouldn\u2019t call Smith back on the unreasonable counter-offer and didn\u2019t get a call from Smith until the Giants were on the clock fourth overall, after Manning (Chargers), Iowa tackle Robert Gallery (Raiders) and Larry Fitzgerald (Cardinals) came off the board.\nGiants coach Ben McAdoo says team \u2018can\u2019t go numb' \nWhen the Chargers took Manning, he still walked on stage, shook hands with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue and held up a blue Chargers No. 1 jersey. Two minutes later Manning was saying he wanted the Chargers to trade him, only to find out from a random kid in a hallway that the Giants had traded for him shortly after.\nManning was a San Diego Charger for one hour and thankful for the trade to New York.\n\u201cI am happy,\u201d Manning said of joining the Giants. \u201cI never expected it to happen.\u201d\nThe Giants ended up getting Manning for Rivers, their No. 3 pick that year and their No. 1 and 5 picks in 2005. They protected Umenyiora and their 2004 second-round pick that became guard Chris Snee.\nGiants need to fire GM Jerry Reese \nThey also had entertained an offer from the Browns, however, looking to move up from No. 7. Cleveland later gave up a second-rounder to the Lions to move up one spot and take tight end Kellen Winslow.\nThe Giants would have moved down and taken Miami (Ohio) QB Ben Roethlisberger at No. 7. But they liked Roethlisberger and they loved Manning. And the rest is history.\nEli Manning: The many faces of the Giants quarterback Manning took the Giants\u2019 reins in Week 11 of his 2004 rookie year and has started every game since. That includes an NFL-high 203 consecutive regular season starts among active players. He is even closing in on his older brother Peyton (208 straight for the Colts, 1998-2010), while Brett Favre\u2019s 287-game streak for the Packers, Jets and Vikings (1992-2010) remains the gold standard.\nIt took Rivers until his third NFL season of 2006 \u2014 after Brees\u2019 signing with New Orleans in free agency \u2014 to assume the starter\u2019s role. But since, Rivers also has been the example of durability, making 180 consecutive regular season starts for the Chargers.\nThere\u2019s plenty of blame to go around for Giants\u2019 0-4 start \nManning, who turns 37 in January, has thrown for 49,327 career yards, 326 TDs and 219 INTs with a career 83.9 QB rating. Rivers, who turns 36 in December, has thrown for 46,940 career yards, 320 TDs and 160 INTs with a career 94.6 QB rating.\nManning is winless against the Chargers in his three career meetings with the franchise that once drafted him first overall despite a respectable 96.7 passer rating, with 69 completions on 106 attempts (65% completion), five TD passes, two interceptions against them. He was of course booed lustily in his first trip to San Diego on Sept. 25, 2005, when he threw for 352 yards, two TDs and no INTs but the Giants were thumped, 45-23.\nEli Manning holds up his new Giants jersey as he poses with then-coach Tom Coughlin and then-GM Ernie Accorsi. (BILL KOSTROUN/AP) Rivers and Manning have met head-to-head only twice, though, with Rivers an undefeated 2-0, because Brees was still the Chargers\u2019 quarterback for that 2005 meeting.\nOn Nov. 8, 2009, Rivers (24-of-36, 209 yards, 3 TDs, 2 INTs) threw a game-winning TD pass to Vincent Jackson with 21 seconds remaining to beat Manning (25-of-33, 215 yards, 2 TD) and the host Giants, 21-20. On Dec. 8, 2013, Rivers (21-of-28, 249 yards, 3 TDs) and the host Chargers beat Manning (20-of-32, 259 yards, 1 TD, 2 INT) and the Giants, 37-14.\nGiants' Olivier Vernon kneels during national anthem \nBut of course, Manning holds the two trump cards: He has brought the Giants two Super Bowls in 2007 and 2011, while the Chargers are still looking for one with Rivers.\nNow on Sunday, they will battle for a new Bowl: \u201cThe 0-4 Bowl\u201d at MetLife Stadium. And in what likely could be their final head-to-head meeting, neither Manning nor Rivers wants to make history this time around.\nTags: nfl new york giants eli manning los angeles chargers philip rivers nfl draft Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "manning", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "philip rivers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "larry fitzgerald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben mcadoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vincent jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert gallery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peyton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris snee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul tagliabue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rivers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brett favre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eli manning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kellen winslow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olivier vernon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vikings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roethlisberger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "a.j. smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ernie accorsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "accorsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom coughlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben roethlisberger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "giants", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chargers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "manning for rivers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego charger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osi umenyiora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raiders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "browns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rivers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a. chargers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "umenyiora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "packers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego chargers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elias sports bureau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metlife stadium", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "madison square garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the theater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broadway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new orleans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffalo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T22:56:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e598ed9309f132c0f31b9cbace832287d6b60d0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jnpli2Ekx2TDQxncVUY67vIxMZufadneNH7YIYRhuVa4VuL_yKLYD3w7czI3xRASSziittInAx.5P4e3Aa4nGIbGf8UBlOpo0g8fZGOTm_q_0lhQ_lM5g6B1ETl0sfZJNML7FyzvWmOukl6HA7oAdHEUnwx.WHIoH9kEy3_rYexJSvTda..Z.zbbD24RWZuG3svX4CXpFW_R9Bjukj35XBaMd21OhcdpeMkB2LrXlTM4-", "site_full": "www.nydailynews.com", "site": "nydailynews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.nydailynews.com/nydnrss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top News", "title": "New Yorkers pay the second highest ATM fees in the country", "title_full": "New Yorkers pay the second highest ATM fees in the country -

(Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Tuesday, October 3, 2017, 1:49 PM \nThe oral herpes virus (HSV-1) was passed onto humans from the ancient chimpanzees we evolved from when our lineage split, and we possibly would have missed out on genital herpes (HSV-2) if it wasn't for an encounter between our ancient ancestors. \nBetween 1.4 million and 3 million years ago in Africa, ancient chimpanzees, Homo erectus and an early human species of evolution between the two, Paranthropus boisei, all lived at the same time, according to a new study published in the journal Virus Evolution . \nThe transfer of the dreaded virus had to happen through a one-off, chance exchange of fluids, the study said, \u2014 first, through bites or scratches from the original culprit, the chimpanzee, then by sexual intercourse between the two human species, Homo erectus eating boisei, or both. \n\"We can 'blame' our ancestors for eating other hominins/great apes, this has been the source of other primate-to-human infections such as HIV,\" the study's senior author Charlotte Houldcroft told CNN . \"Eating other species closely related to oneself has risks, because pathogens adapted to species genetically similar to us will find it easier to jump the species barrier.\" \nJim Carrey says ex used bad wax job to blame him for herpes \nData of ancient climates, fossils and herpes DNA were studied by a team of virologists, engineers and human evolution researchers to create a model \u2014 called a Bayesian network \u2014 that determines the likelihood of HSV-2's transmission from apes to humans. The transfer of the dreaded virus had to happen through a one-off, chance exchange of fluids, the study said, - first, through bites or scratches from the original culprit, the chimpanzee, then by sexual intercourse between the two human species, Homo erectus eating boisei, or both. (BSIP/UIG via Getty Images) \n\"We can use data from diseases to reconstruct events that are completely invisible to the archaeological and fossil records,\" Houldcroft told the news site . \"The signals in the HSV-2 virus are records of direct contact between the ancestors of us and chimps that we can tangibly now 'see' and gives us direct insight into the daily lives of our ancestors.\" \nToday, the World Health Organization estimates that about two-thirds or adults under 50-years-old are infected with oral herpes and one in six have the genital strain. There are more than 100 different kinds of herpes and eight of them can infect humans and cause diseases like chickenpox and mononucleosis, but the oral and genital types are incurable and almost always sexually transmitted. \nGenetically, the most diverse strains of genital herpes comes out of Africa, so the researchers said that a migration out of the continent is responsible for the world-wide effect the virus has on our current population. \nUsher accuser responds to claim she 'assumed the risk of harm' \n\"Essentially, when humans migrated out of Africa, they already carried HSV-2, and wherever humans went, their viruses went too,\" Houldcroft said. \"HSV-2 infects for life and can be passed from mother to baby or between sexual partners, which made sure it successfully spread wherever humans did.\" \n\"They're writing the history,\" infectious disease expert and evolutionary biologist Joel Wertheim told the Washington Post . \"Understanding where these ancient pathogens came from and how they got into humans can help us understand where our future pandemics will likely arise.\" Tags:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim carrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houldcroft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel wertheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte houldcroft", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T22:56:54.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9ee7bb0df6cfc043a0dd35283eefcb93d8387a5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jnpli2Ekx2TARKcqRsC8gZhKNDatiO_suHn2ymRbKVAWL5JANvA_r5ic22qzh_yvSvHuWwnAbt4.dAgj7JgQWDRjggFDpuBBEglCEV8GORq.UtphSBF0_I1cRnpV.LBx2y.evAgoe07FvKz4lt1XrGQxS9TU_9NewHAdEGwlc7o8aI5QJT6T.ewFpPClTvdBse1w.VcXZo1apIaj_hJmydCiaXUjrZ_XVCLXlItWqW_c-", "site_full": "www.nydailynews.com", "site": "nydailynews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.nydailynews.com/nydnrss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top News", "title": "This restaurant serves up boxes for your phone while you eat", "title_full": "This restaurant serves up boxes for your phone while you eat - NY Daily News", "published": "2017-10-03T20:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3538719.1507049588!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/624530698.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 811, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4085a761cc319203fd737c144edfb600f91efb9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jnpli2Ekx2TARKcqRsC8gZhKNDatiO_suHn2ymRbKVAWL5JANvA_r5ic22qzh_yvSvHuWwnAbt4.dAgj7JgQWDbRmhf9Ck8jg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ariel Scotti", "published": "2017-10-03T20:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "This restaurant serves up boxes for your phone while you eat", "text": "This restaurant serves up boxes to deposit your phone while you eat This restaurant serves up boxes for your phone while you eat \"If there's one time in the 24 hours in your day that's a time to engage with the person you're with, it makes sense to me that it's around the dinner table,\" the chef said.

The boxes are the restaurant's James Beard award-winning chef's, Marco Canora, solution to modern technology's disruption of the dining experience. \n\"If there's one time in the 24 hours in your day that's a time to engage with the person you're with, it makes sense to me that it's around the dinner table,\" Canora told Eater. \nCanora told the foodie site that he, personally, doesn't mind if people pull out their devices while eating at his restaurant but after tracking his own usage via an app, he was alarmed by how many hours he spent staring at a screen and decided to offer his customers a way to unplug. Unlike other eateries that have established phone bans or offer discounts to voluntary cord-cutters, Hearth's phone boxes are merely a suggestion. \n\"The hope is that you sit down, you get your menus, and then you're like, 'What is this box?'\" Canora said . \"And then you open the box and there's this very simple note. If you want to do it you can do it, if you don't want to do it, don't. It's just a box on the table that's there if you want it.\" \nAnd the note reads, \"We'd like to invite you to unplug during your meal here at Hearth. Feel free to use this box, put your phone away, and connect with your fellow diners.\" \nCanora said that his staff mentioned that if people didn't have their phones in-hand then they were less likely to post social media snaps of their meals, negating that source of free advertising that has become so important to restaurants. A post shared by LP (@laupicarde) on Aug 26, 2017 at 7:56pm PDT \n\"We are all willing to sacrifice that,\" he said . \"I feel that this is remarkable, and they'll hopefully talk about the box and talk about their food post meal.\" \nBut, the chef also said that since the addition of the phone boxes, he's noticed that \"six out of 10 times,\" people are utilizing the boxes. \"I think people are digging it,\" he said. \n\"We've been here for 13 years.

(Brian Blanco/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:  01 PM \nGiants co-owner John Mara attended a second NFL meeting in two weeks related to player \"activism\" on Tuesday, this time with NFL Players' Association leaders and Giants linebacker Mark Herzlich in attendance. \nMara and linebacker Jonathan Casillas had attended a meeting last Tuesday night at NFL headquarters between 10 owners, eight players from five teams and executive league personnel to discuss the recent national anthem protests and reactions to the social media ambush from President Donald Trump. \nTuesday, a joint NFL/NFLPA statement said commissioner Roger Goodell, NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith, NFLPA president Eric Winston, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Steelers owner Art Rooney, Mara and \"other player leaders engaged in a productive conversation.\" \nESPN reported that Herzlich, Washington QB Kirk Cousins and Jets LB Demario Davis were among the players at the meeting. Most NFL teams have off on Tuesdays but the Giants do not under head coach Ben McAdoo, so Casillas wasn't available to go. But Herzlich is on injured reserve and also on the NFLPA executive committee. \n\"We are all committed to an ongoing dialogue,\" the joint statement read. THE MAGIC MAN \nEli Manning said his message to his 0-4 Giants includes a reminder \"there's not a magic trick to get a win.\" \n\"We have to play the next game,\" Manning said Tuesday. \"That's all we can do. There's not going to be \u2014 there's not a magic trick to get a win. There's not any outside help. It's you keep working hard, you keep preparing and you go out there and you make plays on Sunday that will give (us) a chance to win.\" UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY \nCorner Eli Apple said he only has been on a winless team once in his life: in Pee-Wee. \n\"My first year playing football,\" Apple said Tuesday of his running back days in South Jersey. \"0-8. GVA Vikings 105.\" \nRookie tight end Evan Engram, a two-time captain at Ole Miss, more recently was on a disappointing 5-7 Rebels 2016 team that failed to meet high expectations, but he said the Giants' character is strong. \n\"I don't think that team was as resilient as we are and we're gonna be,\" Engram said. ROSAS ARE BLUE \nRookie kicker Aldrick Rosas missed a 43-yard field goal way wide right early in Sunday's fourth quarter that would have extended the Giants' one-point lead to 20-16. \n\"It's my job to extend the lead when we get the chance to,\" Rosas said. \nRosas is 6-of-6 in extra points and that was his first miss in five field goal tries, but it was a big one. The Giants lost by two, 25-23, when the Bucs offense only needed a field goal on the game-winning drive. \n\"Great snap, great hold, great protection, I just pushed it,\" Rosas said. WHEELS UP \nUndrafted rookie Chad Wheeler jumped in for two snaps at right tackle on Sunday when Justin Pugh had the wind knocked out of him and hurt his back, and Wheeler acquitted himself well. The USC product picked up a stunt to set up an 11-yard Manning completion to Brandon Marshall and then powered his man backward on a Shane Vereen run, though pressure from the opposite side stopped the play and forced a Rosas field goal. Pugh returned to the game on the next drive.

Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) argued that silencers would have had minimal or no effect on the Las Vegas shooting, since gunman Stephen Paddock stockpiled nearly 20 weapons and appeared to have acquired some of them illegally.

A silencer would have likely made it even harder for patrons and law enforcement to trace the location of the rounds. \nPolice have not revealed whether Paddock owned or at any point used a silencer. \nThe SHARE Act would take away the waiting period and registration requirements for buying silencers and also refunded the $200 transfer tax on silencers to anyone who bought one since October 2015. Duncan argued that silencers were essential for hunters and recreational shooters to avoid hearing loss. \nThe act would also weaken restrictions on transportation firearms across state lines and stop some types of ammunition from being classified as \u201carmor-piercing,\u201d which would spare them from closer federal regulation.

Enter promocode nydailynews at checkout for a special discount. \nThis article appears courtesy of RotoExperts.com. \nAs mentioned last week, Fantasy Football Week 5 waiver wire pickups are going to be more quick-hitting to get you in, our and on the way to your waivers. \nQuick note: I'm moving to dollars out of a 100-dollar budget going forward. \nPercentages at this time of the year are tougher given you're estimating remaining budgets. Additionally, you know your league best. If it's an aggressive league, you may have to spend more or vice versa, and we're going to use $5 increments (mostly); you can tweak from there. Week 5 Waiver Wire Pickups: QBs \u2014 Quarterback Streamers \nCarson Palmer, ARI (63%) - Even after getting picked off three times in Week 1, Palmer still has at least 17 points in each game with 21-plus in the last three. Palmer has thrown for at least 325 yards in those three games and faces the woeful Eagles pass defense. \nEli Manning, NYG (59%) - Since switching things up after Week 2, Manning had 47 and 49 attempts the last two weeks with 654 yards, five touchdowns and 30.3/30.6 Fantasy points. The Chargers are a bit tougher matchup wise, but Manning should have a good week. Giants quarterback Eli Manning. (Joe Robbins/Getty Images) \nAndy Dalton, CIN (46%) - Continuing with the adjustment theme, since Bill Lazor became the offensive coordinator, Dalton has 498 yards, six touchdowns and 51.6 Fantasy points in two games. The Bengals host the Bills this week. \nDeshaun Watson, HOU (34%) - Watson isn't going to be Top 5 quarterback all year, but the rushing potential is up there with Tyrod Taylor, and he's clicked in the passing game the past two weeks with 584 yards and six touchdowns. \nTyrod Taylor, BUF (45%) - Taylor has been up-and-down this year, and heading to Cincinnati isn't easy. DON'T: \nBrian Hoyer, SF (8%) - Sure, he's facing the Colts pass defense, but Hoyer isn't working with much and has only thrown for touchdowns in one game. There's potential, sure, but you have to be desperate. Week 5 Waiver Wire Pickups: RBs \nLAST CHANCE: Wendell Smallwood, PHI; D'Onta Foreman, HOU (59%, 28%) - Sure, LeGarrette Blount came up huge, but this is the same running back that ticked you off by literally doing nothing in Week 2. \nSmallwood fills the Darren Sproles roll and more, and is the running back I trust more. Foreman isn't going to hit 60 percent for a while, but Foreman needs to be owned everywhere given his ability and better production in tough-yardage situations. \nFAB Dollars: $30 \nLatavius Murray, Jerick McKinnon, MIN (17%, 3%) - The Dalvin Cook injury is a team-killer both for the Vikings and Fantasy owners. It's painful to see especially for Cook with how good he is and was playing. Nevertheless, we need to consider the backup options, although, neither is overly exciting. Murray's value hinged on the power of the Raiders offense and the high number of scoring opportunities. McKinnon hasn't done much with his increased touches in the past besides show that he can be an explosive complement option. Murray is the better option and will be the lead running back, but McKinnon has some PPR appeal and caught 35-of-39 targets over the final eight games last year (Pat Shurmur took over after their seventh game). \nFAB Dollars: $30 Murray, $20 McKinnon \nAlvin Kamara, NO (46%) - It took the Saints a few years, but they finally found their new Sproles. Until Adrian Peterson retires, gets traded or is released, the only trustworthy option (even in Non-PPR) is Kamara, who's on pace for 80 receptions. \nFAB Dollars: $10-15 \nThomas Rawls, Eddie Lacy, SEA (29%, 19%) - With Chris Carson out for the season (broken ankle), we're back to Rawls and Lacy. My advice? Avoid this backfield altogether. Pete Carroll hinted at Rawls being the option, but Lacy saw the work in Week 4 with Rawls inactive. Don't forget that C.J. Prosise likely returns this week too. Oh, and then there is J.D. McKissic\u2026 more on him soon. \nFAB Dollars: $5-10, Rawls first\u2026 maybe \nAaron Jones, Jamaal Williams, GB (11%, 10%) - Don't go overboard here for two reasons. First, Ty Montgomery might be ready for Week 5. Yea, I'm surprised too. Out for 4-6 weeks, out for 2-4 weeks, week-to-week, possibly ready for Week 5\u2026 okay? Second, Williams isn't officially out either. If he is, Jones is a decent pickup, especially if Montgomery can't return. However, take note that he was fourth on the depth chart and isn't built to be a workhorse/lead option. Jones is explosive but better in the change of pace role. \nFAB Dollars: $10-15 on Jones if Montgomery and Williams are out, $5-10 if not. Same on Williams if Montgomery out and he's okay for Week 5. \nAlex Collins, BAL (10%) - Javorius Allen isn't going anywhere as the pass-catching back, but Collins is now the lead option, which also makes Terrance West expendable. Collins is running better than when he was in Seattle, and while it's possible that it's more to do with the offensive line, he's worth an add. \nFAB Dollars: $5 \nAndre Ellington, ARI (23%) - Ellington simply looks like the best option for the Cardinals, and that might just be because we're comparing him to Chris Johnson\u2026 who's toast. \nEither way, Ellington has 27 targets and 17 receptions in the three games since losing David Johnson. \nFAB Dollars: $5 in PPR \nWayne Gallman, NYG (3%) - Due to an injury to Paul Perkins, the Giants finally started using their best running back. \nFAB Dollars: $5 \nElijah McGuire, NYJ (2%) - Bilal Powell is the top option, and Matt Forte may return and muddy this up, but as mentioned in previous \"For the Future\" portions, McGuire is explosive and similar to Tarik Cohen. \nFAB Dollars: $2-5 \nFOR THE FUTURE: Matt Breida, SF (12%); James Conner, PIT (7%); Chris Ivory, JAX (3%); Austin Ekeler, LAC (0%) - Breida can technically fit in the \"Last Chance\" portion because I can't keep warning Carlos Hyde owners every week. It's also that time of year to start thinking about your backup plans for the lead options to these running backs. DON'T: \nJ.D. McKissic, SEA (3%) - Rawls, Lacy and Prosise. That's all I need to say. Sure, McKissic went off Sunday night, but this backfield is a mess and then some. Week 5 Waiver Wire Pickups: WRs \nLAST CHANCE: Devin Funchess, CAR (25%) - So, Funchess is simply WR17 on the year with 68, 58 and 70 yards in the past three games. You don't want him? Fine, leave him for me everywhere\u2026 although, I already picked him up two weeks ago. \nFAB Dollars: $20 \nWill Fuller, HOU (32%) - Like McGuire, if you paid attention to the \"For the Future\" portion, Fuller is already on your team. Nice return game, huh? Of course, Fuller isn't going to do that every week, and he's still wildly inconsistent, even with his hands. However, he's the No. 2 receiver for the Texans and emerging Watson. \nFAB Dollars: $10 \nTyler Lockett, SEA (42%) - Lockett is flashing the potential that had everyone over-hyping him last year. While Paul Richardson is going to create inconsistency between the two, Lockett's ceiling is higher and better pickup. Seahawks' Tyler Lockett. (L.G. Patterson/AP) \nFAB Dollars: $10 \nJohn Brown, ARI (39%) - This is simple. Brown is the best receiver for the Cardinals at this point of Larry Fitzgerald's career\u2026 if he could stay healthy. \nFAB Dollars: $5 \nCooper Kupp, LAR (44%) - It's going to be hard to trust any receiver for the Rams, even Sammy Watkins, but Kupp could end up being the most consistent as Jared Goff's most sure-handed option. \nFAB Dollars: $5 \nZay Jones, BUF (15%) - With Jordan Matthews out, Jones is the top option for the Bills. Well, that might actually be Charles Clay, but Jones can be similar to Kupp now. \nFAB Dollars: $5 \nGeronimo Allison, GB (13%) - If Davante Adams misses time, double Allison's FAB amount. Even if Adams returns this week, Allison is a wide receiver handcuff of sorts with WR4 value and a ceiling for more any time Jordy Nelson, Adams or Randall Cobb misses time. He actually fills the Adams role better than Cobb's. \nFAB Dollars: $5 \nTaylor Gabriel, ATL (22%) - The Falcons have their bye at an opportune time with Julio Jones and Mohamed Sanu injured. It appears Jones should return after the bye, but Sanu will miss 2-4 weeks. Gabriel gets a value and consistency boost with either receiver out. \nFAB Dollars: $5 \nRicardo Louis, CLE (0%) - We had to take that chance on Rishard Higgins, and unfortunately, not every waiver wire pickup pans out. Louis has 15 targets in the last two games, and Higgins didn't have a single one last week despite being on the field more than Kenny Britt. Hue Jackson also said Britt would have been benched if not for injuries at the position. \nFAB Dollars: $2-3 \nFOR THE FUTURE: John Ross, CIN (6%) - Ross could return in Week 5 and finally get on track, and we shouldn't forget about his potential and ability. Giovani Bernard is the Bengals second leading receiver with Tyler Kroft jumping all the way to third after basically one big game. The Bengals need Ross. DON'T: \nAdam Humphries, TB (6%) - We've seen this before, and at best, Humphries is the fourth option behind Mike Evans, DeSean Jackson and Cameron Brate. Week 5 Waiver Wire Pickups: TEs \nLAST CHANCE: Jared Cook, OAK (55%) - I'm so happy I don't have to write about Cook anymore, although I'm conflicted by the pain of having to recommend him once again. Hey, I've railed against him in the past for showing up 3-4 times a season and getting owners excited for nothing. Starting Cook is just an accident waiting to happen. \nBut alas, 25 targets in four games is hard to ignore\u2026 although, EJ Manuel adds a level of uncertainty. \nFAB Dollars: $5 \nEvan Engram, NYG (46%) - I'd grab Engram over Cook, as I'll echo my pre-draft assessment: he's a wide receiver masquerading as a tight end. Engram has at least 40 yards in each game with 30 targets and 19 receptions already. \nFAB Dollars: $5-10 \nAustin Seferian-Jenkins, NYJ (7%) - The Jets - surprisingly not tanking for 0-16 - need weapons, and Seferian-Jenkins is showing everyone the ability he has. That ability has never been a question, just his inability to avoid off-field issues. Jets tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins. (Al Bello/Getty Images) \nFAB Dollars: $2-5 \nBen Watson, BAL (24%) - Just call him \"Ravens tight end.\" The Ravens tight end is always Fantasy worthy. \nFAB Dollars: $2-5 \nCameron Brate, TB (50%) - O.J. Howard is the tight end of the future, but for now, Brate is still the lead option between the two. \nFAB Dollars: $2-3 Week 5 Buy Low and Sell High \nQuick note: Splitting the Buy Low into two sections Buy Low \nMatt Ryan - We knew about the regression; he's still better than this \nMarcus Mariota - He's a QB1 \nJay Ajayi - Could qualify for both categories with that knee, but talent hasn't left him \nJoe Mixon - Needs to read the field better and can develop with continued work \nDeMarco Murray - More inconsistent than last year but more touchdowns are coming \nChristian McCaffrey - The Panthers have to be smarter than this and get him more touches, plus\u2026 Jonathan Stewart (below) \nDemaryius Thomas - Too talented to not turn it around \nAmari Cooper - Despite my disdain for the hype he receives, still much better than this \nGolden Tate - Remember how slow he started last year or what he did in Week 1? \nJimmy Graham - If healthy, easily Top 10 tight end \nBuy Low - Could be a Bust this Year, but Potential Reward \nBen Roethlisberger - Still avoid on road and wait until Week 7, if possible \nMelvin Gordon - Like Ajayi with the knee but even more concern with YPT and touchdown dependent \nMarshawn Lynch - Latavius Murray didn't need 200 carries or 800 rushing yards to score 12 times and near RB1 status last year \nIsaiah Crowell - DeShone Kizer is killing the offense (yes, I'm doing a told-ya-so) but if a change comes \nMark Ingram - Maybe the Saints move on from Peterson, or he does from them \nMartavis Bryant - See: Roethlisberger \nJamison Crowder - Was Kirk Cousins' boy last year. Maybe they can rekindle the romance? \nEric Ebron - Might remember what those things at the end of his arms are for Sell High \nCam Newton - He doesn't face the Patriots again \nLeGarrette Blount - See: Smallwood \nJonathan Stewart - Injury prone, really that simple \nAmeer Abdullah - Only if someone thinking Top 15-ish happening - getting no use inside the 10 \nChris Hogan - Fifteen receptions, four touchdowns - I know it's the Patriots, but\u2026 \nLarry Fitzgerald - Love him, but fades in the second half, Brown is back (for now) and volume dependent \nSammy Watkins - If even can after last week, but schedule gets brutal after the Cowboys \nCoby Fleener - Already quieted down, and now Willie Snead returns Tags:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

warming New York, divest from fossil fuel companies NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, October 3, 2017, 4:19 PM \nForget the bizarre tweets and insults from the White House, or the images of the President touring San Juan: What\u2019s happened in Puerto Rico will change life there for many years after all the news has faded from your feed. \nEarly estimates put the economic damage from Hurricane Maria at $30 billion, a third of the island\u2019s annual economic output. Eighty percent of its crops have been destroyed \u2014 \u201cthere is no agriculture on Puerto Rico, and there won\u2019t be for at least another year,\u201d said one official. It may be a year before power returns, and even that won\u2019t solve the deeper problems. As one official said, the devastation had set back the island \u201c20 or 30 years\u201d \u2014 that is, an entire human generation\u2019s worth of progress lost in a few hours. \nThe response from New Yorkers has been generous, which makes sense because of the close ties between these two parts of our nation. Gov. Cuomo set up a statewide collection program for aid, gathering the donations in the Javits Center, where Jet Blue has offered to fly them to San Juan. Two members of Congress \u2014 Nydia Velasquez and Jose Serrano \u2014 were in the first Congressional delegation ashore on Puerto Rico. Mayor De Blasio immediately ordered the public schools to prepare for an influx of students coming from the island. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the sheer breadth and magnitude of this that\u2019s so shocking,\u201d Hizzoner insisted. \u201cI mean its just total. Our folks have said, very clearly, there\u2019s endless need.\u201d \nBut there is one curious missing piece: as New York scrambles to help, it continues to invest billions of dollars in the fossil fuel companies that caused \u2014 and may have covered up \u2014 the global warming that makes such events more devastating. \nMake no mistake, Maria is precisely what climate change looks like. September 2017 saw more hurricane activity in the Atlantic than in any month since record-keeping began in 1851. Of all the Category 5 storms to hit U.S. territory, a quarter have come this year. \nThe deluges in the Puerto Rican mountains may have set new global records for most rain in an hour; when they finally cleared, Puerto Ricans without air-conditioning or even fans faced a record-breaking heat wave. The island has spent the last year trying to deal with an outbreak of Zika virus, a classic climate-change disease. Imagine what the mosquitoes are like today. \nThese are precisely the kind of effects climate scientists have predicted. Warm air holds more water vapor than cold; hence, bigger rains. Hurricanes draw their strength from the ocean\u2019s heat; hence, higher winds. As we learned during Sandy, the higher ocean can surge farther inland. \nAnd we are learning more every day about how the oil companies knew all this was coming. Great investigative reporting from places like the Columbia Journalism School have shown that, for instance, Exxon knew everything there was to know about climate change 40 years ago. But instead of telling the rest of us, they spent a fortune covering it up, purchasing the politicians who would make sure change came slowly if at all. \nNew York\u2019s courageous attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, has been in the forefront of chasing Exxon and its ilk, uncovering many of the documents that make clear their complicity. And some municipalities have risen to the challenge: San Francisco and Oakland announced last month that they were suing oil companies for the damages caused by ongoing climate havoc. \nBut not New York City. So far, the Big Apple is content to keep investing its money in these companies. Its pension funds have billions sunk in the stock of the corporations who\u2019ve done, and keep doing, the damage. This is not only maddening in any moral sense, it\u2019s crazy economically: These sectors have been among the weakest parts of the economy for years, underperforming other investments. If New York had divested when campaigners started asking after Sandy, its retirees would be on much more solid financial ground. \nBut better late than never. On Oct. 28, thousands of New Yorkers will march across the Brooklyn Bridge into the parts of the Lower East Side still rebuilding from Sandy. They\u2019re demanding the city commit to 100% renewables, and get people back in their homes who are still adrift long after the storm. \nBut the #Sandy5 effort also demands divestment, and it knows who is accountable. New York\u2019s elected officials \u2014 the borough presidents, the public advocate, the comptroller and the mayor \u2014 along with city unions all have a say in where pension money gets invested. They should speak with conviction and force. It\u2019s one more way to express our solidarity with people in Puerto Rico. We can\u2019t take back Maria, but we can make sure we\u2019re not funding the next one. \nMcKibben is the founder of the global grassroots climate campaign 350.org and author of the forthcoming book \u201cRadio Free Vermont.\u201d Join the Conversation:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hizzoner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose serrano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuomo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mckibben", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de blasio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric schneiderman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nydia velasquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zika", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jet blue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exxon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york daily news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia journalism school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "big apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn bridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lower east side", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new yorkers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javits center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:03:40.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13eb57add956798996c53846df6ec7550f78471f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jnpli2Ekx2TBBBi.q4JzWsSNDdCr3vV1Rxsa6TIFYOAwPGhcGywv_ZoFF7NFI.7KAHPcxdGmXHZXAyHZjzM_7s7vdtsBXW4Rc", "site_full": "www.nydailynews.com", "site": "nydailynews.com", "site_section": "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/devils/index_rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYDN Rss Article only", "title": "SEE IT: Boy can't stop squeaking after swallowing pet toy", "title_full": "SEE IT: Boy can't stop squeaking after swallowing pet toy", "published": "2017-10-03T23:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3539132.1507061578!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/squeak4f-1-web.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 811, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 49, "comments": 0, "shares": 49}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13eb57add956798996c53846df6ec7550f78471f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jnpli2Ekx2TBBBi.q4JzWsSNDdCr3vV1Rxsa6TIFYOAwPGhcGywv_ZoFF7NFI.7KAHPcxdGmXHZXAyHZjzM_7s7vdtsBXW4Rc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ARIEL SCOTTI", "published": "2017-10-03T23:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "SEE IT: Boy can't stop squeaking after swallowing pet toy", "text": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, October 3, 2017, 4:15 PM \nAn unidentified boy in Tucuman, Argentina, accidentally swallowed a piece of a pet toy and then couldn't stop making squeaking sounds. \nIn a video recorded by his emergency room doctor, Dr. Santiago Gomez Zuviria, the unnamed 8-year-old child opens his mouth and begins to squeak nonstop.

Lysozyme, a special protein that generates electricity when pressure is applied, can be used as a new source of fuel for bodily implanted devices, like the kind that administer medications, according to new research published in the journal Applied Physics Letters .\nIt's found in tears, saliva, milk, mucus, and egg whites and in its crystalized form, can produce an electrical charge, researchers from the University of Limerick in Ireland found. When the protein was pressed between two thin glass slides, it produced piezoelectricity, a form of energy that occurs as a product of stress and pressure.\n\"While piezoelectricity is used all around us, the capacity to generate electricity from this particular protein had not been explored,\" researcher Aimee Stapleton told the journal . \"However, because it is a biological material, it is non-toxic so it could have many innovative applications such as electroactive anti-microbial coatings for medical implants.\"\nOnline friendships matter as much as in-person for teens: study \nThe discovery opens the door for potential devices to be at least partially created out of something the body is already familiar with. These implantable piezoelectric devices will be controlled and powered by lysozyme sensors in the body. They'll more flexible and biodegradable, too.\n\"This is a new approach,\" lead researcher Tofail Syed said. \"We also imagine that lysozyme may be employed as an antimicrobial additive/coating to implants,\" the team explained. \nTags: health studies featured lifestyle Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tofail syed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aimee stapleton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of limerick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "applied physics letters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:03:54.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3210c51cc5ba4c05b6b28ceb73bab0d06b1800ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jmHAS0QL2agFsGf_rONw7g8.WD0067nr5mditD4B5Monxv.xjJvS47snnIRwuuc49PvCeK_oDeeEBX3YEAn6RUi6DBIlvi1z6N_LrryNt7cN3hn_c.P9JSs_fqNp9Vjhw", "site_full": "www.nydailynews.com", "site": "nydailynews.com", "site_section": "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/devils/index_rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYDN Rss Article only", "title": "Man accused of killing girlfriend demonstrates shooting in court", "title_full": "Man accused of killing girlfriend demonstrates shooting in court", "published": "2017-10-03T23:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3539090.1507060735!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/gebo4n-4-web.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 811, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3210c51cc5ba4c05b6b28ceb73bab0d06b1800ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jmHAS0QL2agFsGf_rONw7g8.WD0067nr5mditD4B5Monxv.xjJvS47snnIRwuuc49PvCeK_oDeeEBX3YEAn6RUi6DBIlvi1z6N_LrryNt7cN3hn_c.P9JSs_fqNp9Vjhw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DAVID BOROFF", "published": "2017-10-03T23:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Man accused of killing girlfriend demonstrates shooting in court", "text": "Man accused of killing girlfriend uses prop gun to demonstrate fatal shooting in court Man accused of killing girlfriend demonstrates shooting in court NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, October 3, 2017, 4:01 PM \nA Maine man accused of killing his ex-girlfriend before leading police on the longest manhunt in state history used a prop gun in court to demonstrate how she died. \nRobert Burton testified during in his Bangor trial on Tuesday that he fatally shot 37-year-old Stephanie Gebo in self-defense in June of 2015 after he was shot in the shoulder with the same gun. \n\"She put the gun underneath my chin so hard that I saw stars,\" Burton said as he stood next to a mattress while holding the toy gun, according to the Bangor Daily News . \"She told me she was going to kill me and get away with it.\" \nBurton said he put his hand on the gun and tried to keep her from shooting him. He claims she lost her balance and the gun went behind her back. He said the gun went off twice as she fell toward him, according to the Bangor Daily News. \nA medical examiner says Ginn Gebo was shot in the back, and prosecutors argue that Burton acted out of jealousy. They had broken up in May of 2015, but got back together the following month, Burton testified earlier this week. \nThe gun has not been recovered. Robert Burton (c.) appears in court during his murder trial in Maine. (WCSH6) \nBurton said he heard about possible relationships Gebo may have had with other men. \n\"I got more and more agitated during the day,\u201d Burton testified, according to the newspaper . \u201cI decided I\u2019d bind her wrists and ankles with duct tape and make her tell the truth about other men.\" \nKim Wall stabbed 15 times after boarding submarine for interview \nHowever, Burton said he was calmer by the time he went to her house and \"forgot the duct tape was there.\" \nBurton had led police on a 68-day manhunt after Gebo had been found dead.

and soon Parents need school safety information, and soon NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  15 PM \nNo textbook instructs a mayor or schools chancellor on what to do when teenage bullying bursts beyond controllable bounds into the kind of violence that left one Bronx teen dead and another jailed facing murder charges. \nMayor de Blasio and Chancellor Carmen Fari\u00f1a acted on the right impulse, promptly holding a \u201ccommunity conversation on school safety\u201d Monday and inviting parent leaders from across the city to weigh in. \nBut that one smart first move doesn\u2019t make up for their reticence until now to keep parents informed about what goes on behind school walls, or damaging ripple effects of that cone of silence. \nAt the Monday town hall, for more than an hour, de Blasio and Fari\u00f1a took questions from moms and dads by turns anxious, aggrieved and unassured that the public schools their children attend have the means or methods to keep bullying or violence out of classrooms, lunchrooms and halls. \nDe Blasio drove down his habitual crisis-moment rut, deflecting responsibility while promising progress: \u201cLast year was the safest on record, but we have more to do and we have to do it together.\u201d \nSafest by the city\u2019s own tally of assaults, arrests and summonses, yes \u2014 but the state\u2019s inventory of violent incidents shows an increase, possibly due to increasingly consistent reporting by schools to the state. \nTroublingly, bullying and harassment were also reported more frequently in the 2015-16 school year than the one before. \nFari\u00f1a recapped measures that her school principals, deans and counselors are taking toward constructive measures to preempt bullying and disturbances, like restorative justice circles where kids can make amends with one another and defuse beefs, quiet spots where stressed-out students can throw themselves on cushions, and workshops teaching young people responsibility for their actions. \nOf such emotional lessons emerge mature and thoughtful young people. One day, should her successors continue the work now begun and invest in the sheer number of counselors necessary to do the painstaking anti-conflict work child by child, this city may well look back on the achievement as Fari\u00f1a\u2019s signature legacy. \nBut not if she can\u2019t convince parents here and now that schools are on the right path to safety and order. \nThe confidence problem goes deeper than Fari\u00f1a\u2019s off-kilter assurance during the town hall meeting that what looks like a wild classroom can in fact be a place where \u201cinteractive learning\u201d goes on. \nDeepening the disconnect, the mayor and chancellor are asking parents to choose their children\u2019s schools, and choose to keep them there, with next to no substantive information about those schools\u2019 safety records. That\u2019s too much to expect, in an era when constituents rightly expect real-time information a la the NYPD\u2019s Compstat. \nFew parents know they can go to the state Education Department\u2019s website to look up reports on violent and disruptive incidents, as well as instances of cyber-bullying or harassment, and fewer still have the time for a deep dive through the spreadsheets \u2014 which in any case lag by two years. \nSimilarly, families have to hunt in the recesses of the city Department of Education\u2019s website for School Safety Agent Excel files listing NYPD arrests and summonses, and get no clue on such crucial stats as 911 calls made or weapons confiscated. \nInstead, DOE serves up subjective school-climate survey results from students, teachers and parents to tell the story on each school\u2019s safety, alongside detailed stats on test scores, attendance, demographics and other vital signs on academic performance. \nTo judge from the unaddressed downward spiral of safety-survey results at Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation, the scene of the deadly attack \u2014 and to judge again from Fari\u00f1a\u2019s new directive to her superintendents to review their schools\u2019 own survey results and address trouble spots \u2014 the officials in charge haven\u2019t been taking the survey results on violence, bullying and disorder seriously enough. \nAnd why would they? The forces that should be holding principals and saccountable can\u2019t. For starters, there\u2019s no way for parents to compare survey results between schools to see how they stack up against one another. Armed with knowledge, parents can demand change. \nDe Blasio, a former school board member, understands this. He acknowledged to a mom Monday that the schools need to get better information to parents, faster. As the mayor put it: \u201cWe have to make sure the accountability mechanism is working.\u201d \nFor that accounting to actually result in safer schools where learning thrives, de Blasio and Fari\u00f1a must err on the side of delivering more information to parents, not less \u2014 with all due consideration to student-privacy laws and the integrity of criminal proceedings. \nIf they\u2019re worried parents will pull kids from unsafe schools en masse, as a school safety official at the forum suggested could ensue: That\u2019s a risk they will have to take. \nNo matter how many programs and comfy cushions Fari\u00f1a puts in place, the measure of her anti-violence efforts\u2019 success will be consistent and detailed safety stats that every family can readily see on schools\u2019 DOE profile page as they shop around \u2014 moving in an indisputably positive direction. \nakatz@nydailynews.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mayor de blasio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de blasio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de blasio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fari\u00f1a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmen fari\u00f1a", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "urban assembly school for wildlife conservation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state education department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of education", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fari\u00f1a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bronx", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:32:53.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78628affce47fb0d9298a9438d6d7001115d0d63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jnpli2Ekx2TBxbz6tD5gcX0jrql1yNaQ6Kh7HBHJ9TPDlNjXws_fFzgND1qpPa25POBcgOBV9i_AzU2fWujjxkynhie68j7YH", "site_full": "www.nydailynews.com", "site": "nydailynews.com", "site_section": "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/nets/index_rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NYDN Rss Article only", "title": "Most moisturizers are lying about being allergen-free", "title_full": "Most moisturizers are lying about being allergen-free", "published": "2017-10-04T00:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3539253.1507065012!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/153825223.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 811, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78628affce47fb0d9298a9438d6d7001115d0d63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_n42yrPlAWr_sehLuz397jnpli2Ekx2TBxbz6tD5gcX0jrql1yNaQ6Kh7HBHJ9TPDlNjXws_fFzgND1qpPa25POBcgOBV9i_AzU2fWujjxkynhie68j7YH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CONSTANCE GIBBS", "published": "2017-10-04T00:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Most moisturizers are lying about being allergen-free", "text": "Many moisturizers are greasing your palms \u2014 most products that claim to be fragrance-free and hypoallergenic fail to live up to the claim.\nResearchers at Northwestern University analyzed the top-selling moisturizers sold by Target, Amazon and Walmart and found that 45% of products that claimed to be \u201cfragrance-free\u201d contained fragrance and 83% of products that were supposed to be \u201chypoallergenic\u201d contained a potential allergen.\nThe study analyzed 174 lotions, creams, oils, butter and ointments to determine if what the label says matched the actual product.
