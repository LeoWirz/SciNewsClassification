We\u2019re into the Falcons\u2019 bye week and you\u2019ve got questions. Just remember that all opinions you see in this space are mine, unless otherwise noted. \nAnd we\u2019re off. \nLarry from Hampton, GA \nIf you had success running the football and it's fourth-and-1, isn't it a no-brainer to run the football and get the first down? You say that you have to rely or trust the coach\u2019s decision. As you see it didn't work out in the Super Bowl as well as this game. Still trusting the coach\u2019s decision? \nMatt: Yes, I am, Larry. You can\u2019t judge a coach on one play. \nJulian from Los Angeles, CA \nHey Matt, love your column and your insights. Thanks for doing this. I do have a question, but first I have a comment. I knew someone was going to come on here on Monday and talk about Julio Jones always being hurt. My Steelers fan friends tell me that's why Antonio Brown is better than Julio Jones, but he's not. No. 11 is the best WR in the NFL. Injuries, especially to wide receivers, happen. The Falcons didn't lose that game because 11 got hurt. Which leads me to my question. Besides turnovers, what else do you think the Falcons need to do better when they come back after their bye to get better? A 3-1 record is good but they could easily be 1-3 or 2-2 right now. They have to start playing better. \nMatt: Julian, they have to get healthy. By the end of Sunday\u2019s game, a total of eight players were out because of various injuries. Aside from turning the ball over and creating more turnovers, the Falcons need to start tackling better, too. There were a lot of missed tackles. You might as well throw in catching the ball, too. For whatever reasons, there have been a lot of tipped and deflected balls by the receivers \u2013 and some of those have led to turnovers. The good news is that everything I just mentioned is correctable. And the bye week could not be coming at a better time. \nJerry from Cuthbert, GA \nDuke Riley is looking confused and missing a lot of tackles? Looks like he's in over his head. Thanks for the ear. \nMatt: Hey, Jerry. You\u2019ve got to remember Duke Riley is a first-year player and every game is on-the-job training for him. The good news is that he has lots of speed, plays fast and puts himself in position to make plays more times than not. Yes, he\u2019s missed some tackles, but like I noted above, that\u2019s correctable \u2013 and he\u2019ll only get better in time. \nHayse from Nashville, TN \nHey Beek, I\u2019ve been a fan all my life and a season ticket holder since Vick\u2019s rookie year. I drive down from Nashville for the games and, for years, I flew in from Utah. I say this to establish some fan credibility before I ask this question. So, my question is, what do we have to do to A) Get our fans to the games? B) Get to their seats on time? I\u2019ve never consistently seen so many empty seats over the years and it seems like it takes an NFC championship to get the house packed. It\u2019s just frustrating to me to see the support that Atlanta United is getting and the Falcons (and Braves) games barely seem half full. It\u2019s embarrassing and needs to stop! \nMatt: Thanks for the question and the Falcons are lucky to have to loyal fans like you. I\u2019ll be very honest here \u2013 I have no idea what\u2019s going on with the fans \u2013 and I find it surprising, especially coming into Sunday\u2019s game with a 3-0 mark. But one reader (below) offers at least one reason why, Hayse. \nRob from Canton, GA \nI have been following the Falcons for many years, watching players such as Jeff Van Note, Steve Bartkowski, etc., In watching the Falcons I have never noticed a killer instinct with them, like other teams. For example, the Super Bowl last year, it looked like the team and coaches thought to themselves that we had it wrapped up. New England wanted it worse than us. What is it going to take to get this Falcons team with a never-let-down attitude? Also, I can give you one reason why the seats are empty. People like me who had season tickets for over 50 years never saw our Falcons win a Super Bowl, and I will not get season tickets again until they really want to play and never quit, for both the team and coaches. They all need to look at themselves and ask the simple question, am I really playing or coaching to the best of my ability? Just an old man venting! \nMatt: Thanks for reading and thank for your comment, Rob. I will add that this team really cares about each other, plays hard and wants to win \u2013 I don\u2019t see any quit in them. And I don\u2019t think they let up at the end of games, like many have suggested here. They do have to solve the turnovers issue \u2013 and soon. \nStan from Las Vegas, NV \nAfter what happened in Las Vegas on Sunday night, it is hard to be upset with my Falcons over a loss. Here is my question do you feel the turf area at Mercedes-Benz Stadium is too hard or so different than the Georgia Dome as to cause all the sudden rash of injuries. I know they are a part of the sport, but we have played two games and have seven players injured, this just seems above the normal amount. Thanks for all you do keep up the good work. \nMatt: Amen to that, Stan. Thanks for your perspective here. To your question, I honestly don\u2019t think it\u2019s the surface. If you look around the league, players are injured in every single game. The Falcons are fortunate that no one has suffered any season-ending injuries. Let\u2019s see how this plays out before we start drawing those types of conclusions. \nAaron from Americus, GA", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "duke riley", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "julio jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bartkowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuthbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ga  duke riley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff van note", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julian", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "falcons", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "braves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tn  hey beek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta united", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "georgia dome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "americus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nashville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hampton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:55:54.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a66bf2c4ae171ff222797e4ac9ab5149835422c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOqEoTbP6E1EchhfzIGsUuPIiKfQxKzMc.J3vKTmJcqna..iz4p6apPmGjp4XpibpRwQKMuVwQs3oMksCHy6Ud7ekzA_7SlxXPHSVQtP2ISCd3iROfPCzL.d5S1NqA5c4JbQtvRN6mhg3bxEZvA3i1c4BhP1902exu0UxwVM8OkGi87K6_Oeuk5t", "site_full": "sports.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "NFL on Yahoo!

This week's Redskins Drive of the Game, presented by Ford, was a three-play, 75-yard scoring drive finished off by a Ryan Grant three-yard touchdown catch that gave the Redskins the lead. \nAfter a 10-play, 79-yard scoring drive by the Kansas City Chiefs to open up the second half, one that would put them ahead for the first time of the night, the Redskins responded rapidly with a big pass play. \nStarting from their own 25-yard line, the Redskins helped quiet a crowd that had gained momentum with the help of tight end , who caught a 69-yard pass that came about largely because of his speed and patience. \nQuarterback Kirk Cousins threw a perfect pass to Davis open down the right seam, and then the tight end began using his vision, waiting for blocks ahead of him to scamper around, cutting to his left and running down to the Kansas City six-yard line. \nThe pass play put Davis in 10th all-time in receiving yards among tight ends in NFL history. \n\u201cWe call him el caballo because he\u2019s like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field,\u201d Cousins said of Davis. \u201cWe always talk about his hamstrings and how they\u2019re like the hamstrings of a 19 year old.

The department's deputy director-general (operations division) Datuk Soiman Jahid said this was the outcome of the department\u2019s first week of nationwide inspections of the schools, which began on Sept 25. In the first week of inspection, conducted by the special task force on tahfiz schools, a total of 400 officers inspected 228 schools. From the total, 152 schools had adhered to the safety regulations while the rest failed to meet the requirements. The lack of safety measures mostly involve failure to provide enough fire exits, as well as overcrowding. Another safety issue in the affected schools was having cooking facilities situated near the living quarters. \u201cThe operators of the 76 schools were issued notices to meet the safety requirements as soon as possible, before the full report on the inspections is submitted to the Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Ministry on Oct 19,\u201d said Soiman. He was speaking to reporters after attending a fire safety campaign at the Dewan Jubli Perak Sultan Ismail Petra near Panji here today. More than 700 tahfiz school operators attended the programme. Soiman said the inspections involved both registered and unregistered schools. He said the department expects to inspect between 1,000 or 1,500 tahfiz schools in total before the deadline. The issue of fire safety in tahfiz schools came to the fore recently following a fire at a Keramat religious school, which killed 23 people, 21 of whom were students. The authorities had raised questions on the alleged lack of safety measures in place at the Pusat Tahfiz Darul Quran Ittifaqiyah. \u00a9 New Straits Times Press (M) Bhd Reblog ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sharifah mahsinah abdul", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fathil asri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soiman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "datuk soiman jahid", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rescue department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "housing and local government ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new straits times press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dewan jubli perak sultan ismail petra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pusat tahfiz darul quran ittifaqiyah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:59:18.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8846a7b9a60b65daa67f3eef7dcab690cdb5371d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTueMYICVUfckKKsNVV9UO3w1Lwk9Dc7mLnVUnFPlIdibsuEmb1V2dTQTMsgi3_HXk4WKPH796YPTbU58XSJDYs", "site_full": "answers.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://answers.yahoo.com/dir/index?link=over&sid=396545517&more=1&s=date", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Puerto Rico | Yahoo Answers", "title": "is puerto rico being neglected by the U.S?", "title_full": "is puerto rico being neglected by the U.S? | Yahoo Answers", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "/static/images/answers-icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7875556d7bcf06285e19898fab6fb9cc20b0ae37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTueMYICVUfckKKsNVV9UO3w1Lwk9Dc7mLnVUnFPlIdibsuEmb1V2dTQTMsgi3_HXk4WKPH796YPUJ9nr0EWGs.PdCAFtmnqr0-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "Alex", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "Actually, it's being neglected by the Trump administration.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:59:53.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3227bd6a5487485af8b62fb120d3ee6da50c56db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYAL0cN0EkN2Y.3ZOZVLqF45vR20QOZyRd1y2HG31fIXEozUWOojMoAMEEeqn6lbq1vc_IN84jrGKiE4ogTAQYTHKMUBY_qSQ_MWau84Ghpdw6HSE0B..8R6GY9h3yYxUZ5pQoQjNkhw--", "site_full": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Just one hour of exercise per week can beat depression, study finds", "title_full": "Just one hour of exercise per week can beat depression, study finds", "published": "2017-10-03T12:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.165, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5UKImOIgC8NXqi38QVZMrQ--~B/aD0zNDcxO3c9NTA4MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/29b9d87d45e888f2697abb404f865006", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 66, "comments": 0, "shares": 66}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3227bd6a5487485af8b62fb120d3ee6da50c56db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYAL0cN0EkN2Y.3ZOZVLqF45vR20QOZyRd1y2HG31fIXEozUWOojMoAMEEeqn6lbq1vc_IN84jrGKiE4ogTAQYTHKMUBY_qSQ_MWau84Ghpdw6HSE0B..8R6GY9h3yYxUZ5pQoQjNkhw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T12:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Just one hour of exercise per week can beat depression, study finds", "text": "Exercise Rex More Just one hour of exercise a week can be enough to prevent depression, a study found. That much activity would be enough to prevent depression in 12% of cases, according to a large-scale study of Norwegian adults. Scientists monitored levels of exercise and symptoms of depression and anxiety in almost 34,000 Norwegian adults over 11 years. Results showed that people who reported doing no exercise at all at the start of the study were 44% more likely to develop depression than those exercising one to two hours per week. Six reasons that sex is good for your health Lead researcher Dr Samuel Harvey, from the Black Dog Institute at the University of New South Wales, Australia, said: \u2018We\u2019ve known for some time that exercise has a role to play in treating symptoms of depression, but this is the first time we have been able to quantify the preventative potential of physical activity in terms of reducing future levels of depression. \u2018These findings are exciting because they show that even relatively small amounts of exercise \u2013 from one hour per week \u2013 can deliver significant protection against depression. \u2018We are still trying to determine exactly why exercise can have this protective effect, but we believe it is from the combined impact of the various physical and social benefits of physical activity.

The documents submitted to investigators show associates of Trump\u2019s company were in contact with, or being contacted by, Russian officials in 2016, The Washington Post reported Monday, citing sources familiar with the issue.\nThe two previously unreported contacts include discussions between Trump\u2019s personal attorney Michael Cohen and a business associate of his, Russian-born real estate developer Felix Sater, about whether Cohen would travel to Russia to attend an economic conference which would also be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin .\nTrending: Late-Night TV on Las Vegas Shooting: Stephen Colbert Begs Trump for Gun Laws, Trevor Noah Blasts Trump for Reaction to Vegas Versus Puerto Rico\nSater, who had previously worked with Cohen and Trump on an intended deal to build a Trump tower in Moscow, suggested Cohen should attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum and suggested if he did, he could meet Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and, potentially, Putin.\nCohen did not attend the conference, which he was emailing Sater about several weeks prior to the Republican National Convention, where Trump sealed the GOP presidential candidate.\n\u201cI did not accept this invitation,\u201d Cohen told The Post. \u201cI have never been to Russia.\u201d\nDon't miss: Democrats Demand GOP Pull Gun Silencer Bill After Las Vegas Mass Shooting\nThe other contact between Trump\u2019s business and Russia pertained to another email exchange including Cohen, who was sent an email from a company founded by a Russia billionaire about a building project in Moscow that Cohen also rejected.\n\u201cLike any other international real estate brand, it is not uncommon for third party developers to submit proposals for potential real estate projects all over the world,\u201d Cohen told The Post, explaining that only s \u201cvery small percentage of these proposals are ever pursued.\u201d\nBoth exchanges have been turned over to congressional investigators looking into Russia\u2019s alleged attempt to interfere with the U.S. presidential election, and do show that some of Trump\u2019s business associates received contact from Russian figures into 2016.\nMost popular: Monday Night Football: Are Unbeaten Chiefs Roger Goodell\u2019s Perfect NFL Team?\nThe documents were turned over to investigators by the Trump Organization in August, according to The Post\u2019s report, with Cohen also stating to the newspaper that he was prepared to fully cooperate with the authorities. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is also looking at the papers.\nThe documents also shed new light on President Trump's campaign boast that \"I have ZERO investments in Russia,\" as he tweeted in July, 2016. At a minimum, the papers reveal that such investments were at least being discussed with Russian officials \u2014 whom federal authorities have said meddled in the 2016 election on the side of Trump .\nMore from Newsweek\nRussia Attacks CIA for 'Discover Truth' About Kremlin Job Offer Facebook Delivering Thousands of Russia-Linked Ads to Congressional Russia Investigations In Catalonia, Is Russia Trying to Influence Another Vote?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.newsweek.com/late-night-tv-las-vegas-shooting-stephen-colbert-begs-trump-gun-laws-trevor-676392&quot;", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-company-had-more-contact-with-russia-during-campaign-according-to-documents-turned-over-to-investigators/2017/10/02/2091fe5e-a6c0-11e7-850e-2bdd1236be5d_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-low_trumprussia-317pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.e3adc5cf3864", "http://www.newsweek.com/kansas-city-chiefs-monday-night-football-washington-redskins-nfl-sport-676347&quot;", "http://www.newsweek.com/facebook-delivering-thousands-russia-linked-ads-russia-investigations-675235?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=yahoo_news&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.newsweek.com/russia-attacks-cia-job-offer-discover-truth-about-kremlin-675802?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=yahoo_news&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-company-had-more-contact-with-russia-during-campaign-according-to-documents-turned-over-to-investigators/2017/10/02/2091fe5e-a6c0-11e7-850e-2bdd1236be5d_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-low_trumprussia-317pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.e3adc5cf3864&quot;", "http://www.newsweek.com/trump-putin-russia-interfered-presidential-election-541302", "http://www.newsweek.com/can-video-bloggers-defeat-putins-propaganda-television-675098&quot;", "http://www.newsweek.com/trump-putin-russia-interfered-presidential-election-541302&quot;", "http://www.newsweek.com/late-night-tv-las-vegas-shooting-stephen-colbert-begs-trump-gun-laws-trevor-676392", "http://www.newsweek.com/catalan-referendum-russia-media-kremlin-674911?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=yahoo_news&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.newsweek.com/can-video-bloggers-defeat-putins-propaganda-television-675098", "http://www.newsweek.com/facebook-adding-employees-review-ads-russia-675967", "http://www.newsweek.com/kansas-city-chiefs-monday-night-football-washington-redskins-nfl-sport-676347", "http://www.newsweek.com/las-vegas-mass-shooting-has-democrats-demanding-gop-pull-gun-silencer-bill-676339", "http://www.newsweek.com/las-vegas-mass-shooting-has-democrats-demanding-gop-pull-gun-silencer-bill-676339&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen colbert begs trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felix sater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rico sater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry medvedev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger goodell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor noah blasts trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump organization", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump's company", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsweek russia attacks cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg international economic forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:33:04.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "afb57d8a0777ad56465934fa52175deaac46e0a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJDiUSVUw4.zII7M0H_gzxMyDGcMX9A5Qx4NOVxJCaeix1Ky13tMrqtsSyxd6m7mMIqTvB_QW3BsM-", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News &amp;

He was 66. Petty died Monday night at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles a day after he suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Malibu, California, spokeswoman Carla Sacks said.\nPetty and his longtime band the Heartbreakers had recently completed a 40th anniversary tour, one he hinted would be their last.\n\"I'm thinking it may be the last trip around the country,\" Petty told Rolling Stone last year. \"We're all on the backside of our 60s. I have a granddaughter now I'd like to see as much as I can. I don't want to spend my life on the road. This tour will take me away for four months. With a little kid, that's a lot of time.\"\nUsually backed by the Heartbreakers, Petty broke through in the 1970s and went on to sell more than 80 million records. The Gainesville, Florida, native with the shaggy blond hair and gaunt features was loved for his melodic hard rock, nasally vocals and down-to-earth style. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted Petty and the Heartbreakers in 2002, praised them as \"durable, resourceful, hard-working, likeable and unpretentious.\"\n\"I'm shocked and saddened by the news of Tom's passing, he's such a huge part of our musical history, there'll never be another like him.\" Eric Clapton wrote in a statement.\nPetty's albums included \"Damn the Torpedoes,\" ''Hard Promises\" and \"Full Moon Fever,\" although his first No. 1 did not come until 2014 and \"Hypnotic Eye.\" As a songwriter, he focused often on daily struggles and the will to overcome them, most memorably on \"Refugee,\" ''Even the Losers\" and \"I Won't Back Down.\"\n\"It's sort of the classic theme of a lot of the work I've done,\" he told The Associated Press in 1989. \"I think faith is very important just to get through life. I think it's really important that you believe in yourself, first of all. It's a very hard to thing to come by. But when you get it, it's invaluable.\"\nPetty didn't just sing about not backing down, he lived it. In 1979, he was enraged when his record label was sold and his contract transferred. Stating that he would not be \"bought and sold like a piece of meat,\" he self-financed what became \"Damn the Torpedoes\" and declared bankruptcy rather than allowing his label, MCA, to release it. He eventually reached a new deal with MCA, for better terms. In the early 1980s, he was again at war with MCA, this time over the label's plans to charge extra money, a dollar higher than the standard $8.98, for his album \"Hard Promises.\" He again prevailed.\nPetty was both a musician and obsessive fan, one who met his childhood heroes and lived out the fantasies of countless young rock lovers. He befriended Byrds leader Roger McGuinn and became close to George Harrison, who performed on \"I Won't Back Down\" and joined Petty, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne in the impromptu super group the Traveling Wilburys. Petty inducted Harrison into the Rock Hall in 2004; two years earlier Dylan's son Jakob inducted Petty. In the 1980s, Petty and the Heartbreakers supported Bob Dylan on a nationwide tour.\nHe would speak of being consumed by rock music since childhood, to the point where his father, whom Petty would later say beat him savagely, thought he was \"mental.\" Awed by the chiming guitars of the Byrds, the melodic genius of the Beatles and the snarling lyrics of Dylan, he was amazed to find that other kids were feeling the same way.\n\"You'd go and see some other kid whose hair was long, this was around '65, and go, 'Wow, there's one like me,'\" he told The Associated Press in 1989. \"You'd go over and talk and he'd say, 'I've got a drum set.' 'You do? Great!' That was my whole life.\"\nBy his early 20s, Petty had formed the group Mudcrutch with fellow Gainesville natives and future Heartbreakers (guitarist) Mike Campbell and (keyboardist) Benmont Tench. They soon broke up, but reunited in Los Angeles as the Heartbreakers, joined by bassist Ron Blair and drummer Stan Lynch. Their eponymous debut album came out in 1976 and they soon built a wide following, fitting easily into the New Wave sounds of the time.\nThe world changed more than Petty did over the past few decades. In 2014, around the time he received an ASCAP Founders Award, he told The Associated Press that he thought of himself as \"kind of a music historian.\"\n\"I'm always interested in the older music, and I'm still always discovering things that I didn't know about,\" he said. \"To be honest, I really probably spend more time listening to the old stuff than I do the new stuff.\"\n___\nAssociated Press Writer Andrew Dalton and AP Entertainment Writer Sandy Cohen contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "george harrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stan lynch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff lynne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy orbison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakob", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benmont tench", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric clapton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy cohen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger mcguinn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron blair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carla sacks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew dalton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ucla medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rolling stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roll hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gainesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rock hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malibu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:34:20.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05a1935f5eaa027ace0c4deeb8e783cf392c5524", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJiFIWh0YhEcv92hsy6xG7g77KvPWlIdsbwdk28JOLxWBFSeUoH1fQQdvgo9m5sdosiU79eVgzayiAuAOEkRPQHsNQ7XfW1nbe", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "How the Las Vegas gunman's hotel neighbor fled massacre", "title_full": "How the Las Vegas gunman's hotel neighbor fled massacre", "published": "2017-10-03T04:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lIKeE9pZiQgy8cysh_uLtg--/aD03Mjc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/e90dcc2ffa645a9b615ad7fc206f9b30076aca66.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05a1935f5eaa027ace0c4deeb8e783cf392c5524", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJiFIWh0YhEcv92hsy6xG7g77KvPWlIdsbwdk28JOLxWBFSeUoH1fQQdvgo9m5sdosiU79eVgzayiAuAOEkRPQHsNQ7XfW1nbe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Frankie TAGGART", "published": "2017-10-03T04:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "How the Las Vegas gunman's hotel neighbor fled massacre", "text": "Las Vegas (AFP) - After fleeing in terror from a massacre of music fans, Ralph Rodriguez returned to his hotel room to discover that America's deadliest shooting had been carried out under his feet. After a weekend at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay hotel, Rodriguez had been enjoying a Sunday night concert by country music star Jason Aldean when gunfire began crackling around the open-air venue.\nIn an interview with AFP, Rodriguez recounted the terrifying moment the crowd realized they were being raked with bullets by a gunman stationed on the 32nd floor of his hotel.\nRodgriguez, an IT consultant, was staying in the room directly above the shooter Stephen Paddock who murdered at least 58 people before turning a weapon upon himself.\n\"He (Aldean) had only done two or three songs when we heard what we thought were firecrackers, to the right of the stage. But then it started and it just didn't stop,\" said Rodriguez, who is from the Pomona Valley, near Los Angeles.\n\"We saw the lights go out on the stage and the band run off. Just then, all the people that had been standing in the festival area came running, crushing towards us.\n\"People started grabbing their loved-ones and just strangers, and trying to help them get out of the way.\n\"It was a horrible experience, but everybody was helping somebody.\n\"I saw people picking up kids that weren't theirs, I saw people pushing wheelchairs for some people they didn't know. They did whatever they could to get those people out of there,\" he said.\n- 'Incredibly chaotic' -\n\"Our problem was we didn't know we know where the shots were coming from, so we were running but we didn't know where we were running. It was incredibly chaotic,\" Rodriguez said.\n\"Then finally, officers started telling us to keep running towards the exit which was pretty far away.\n\"Some issues were happening there so we had to give that up, and we ended up at the other corner and had to climb a 10-foot fence,\" he said.\n\"We used the guard rails as a ladder and we just started throwing people over and catching them on the other side.\n\"We saw bodies down. We didn't know if they had fallen or had been shot. Some people we grabbed and they were bleeding,\" he said.\n\"We didn't know why -- we didn't have time to ask. We said: 'If you can hold it, hold it' and we'd just keep moving.\"\nEventually Rodriguez managed to make his back to the hotel -- a massive casino-resort complex -- where he made the grim discovery that Paddock had been staying immediately below him.\nPolice have now sealed off the room, easily indentifiable from outside as Paddock smashed a window in order to take aim at the crowds below with his arsenal of weapons.\n\"He's on the 32nd floor, room 134, and I'm on the 33rd floor room 134,\" Rodriguez said in an interview in the hotel lobby.\n\"And so today, when the wind blows, his drapes come up and hit my window.

Aisyah and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, accused of fatally poisoning Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half brother of North Korea's ruler pleaded not guilty as their trial began Monday in Malaysia's High Court, nearly eight months after the brazen airport assassination that sparked a diplomatic standoff. (AP Photo/Daniel Chan) More SHAH ALAM, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 Witnesses recounted the last moments of the estranged half brother of North Korea's leader as the trial began Monday in Malaysia of two women accused of assassinating him by smearing an exotic poison on his face. Siti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam are charged in the Feb. 13 murder of Kim Jong Nam using banned VX nerve agent at a crowded airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur. The women, who pleaded innocent at Malaysia's High Court, have said they thought they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show and had been hoodwinked by men suspected of being North Korean agents. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is believed to have considered his older sibling a potential rival for power. Monday's court session was primarily a reconstruction of Kim Jong Nam's final moments at the airport. AIRPORT INFORMATION COUNTER STAFF JULIANA IDRIS Juliana, the first person Kim went to after being attacked, told the court \"his hands were shaking a bit\" but she didn't know why. She said Kim told her \"he was attacked from behind by two women,\" with one of them wiping something over his eyes. She said that at Kim's request she took him to file a report with a police officer before going to a clinic. POLICE OFFICER MOHD ZULKARNAIN SANUDIN Zulkarnain testified that Kim's eyes were red and he could see some liquid on his face, but he could not tell if it was sweat or something else. He said he had mistakenly reported that Kim was South Korean because he had misidentified his passport, issued under North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The passport used Kim's pseudonym, Kim Chol. AIRPORT CLINIC NURSE RABIATUL ADAWIYAH MOHAMAD SOFI Rabiatul said that before Kim had a seizure, she used facial tissue to wipe liquid off his face, but he appeared to still be sweating. She said Kim appeared to be in pain and told her someone sprayed liquid on his face. AIRPORT CLINIC DOCTOR NIK MOHD ADZRUL ARIFF RAJA AZLAN Nik said Kim was unable to respond when he was asked what had happened. \"When I saw him, his hands were clutching his head. He was closing his eyes tightly and his face was very red. He was sweating profusely,\" Nik testified. He said Kim had extremely high blood pressure and rapid pulse and started to display seizure symptoms, with his jaw and teeth clenched and eyes rolling upward. Kim then fell unconscious and his blood pressure plunged, and his pulse gave out, Nik said.

But to migrating birds, they're a potentially fatal attraction, according to a scientific study published Monday. During the seven-year study at National September 11 Memorial and Museum, researchers noticed thousands of birds were drawn to the annual light display, causing them to waste precious energy circling and calling and risking collisions with buildings or capture by predators.\nIn 2015, for example, the count of birds within a half-kilometer (0.3 miles) of the tribute sight went from 500 to 15,700 within a half hour of the lights coming on. And when the lights were turned off, the birds went on their way within minutes.\n\"Migrating is already hard enough for birds without this added danger from artificial light at night,\" said Susan Elbin, of New York City Audubon, co-author with researchers from Oxford University and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.\nTheir study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, estimates that the light beams influenced more than a million birds \u2014 including warblers, thrushes and sparrows \u2014over seven years of the one-night tributes.\nResearchers said they could not get an accurate count of how many birds actually died since some of them fell onto scaffolding, were snatched by scavengers or disposed of by maintenance workers.\nMost bird migration occurs at night, and billions of birds move through increasingly light-polluted skies. The authors recommend bright lights around homes, stadiums, offshore oil rigs and construction sites be turned off as much as possible during migration season, especially from midnight to dawn.\nUnder a protocol established in 2002 to prevent harm to migrating birds, the tribute lights representing the fallen Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are turned off for 20 minutes whenever more than 1,000 birds are seen circling or flying dangerously low with frequent calling. The interludes of darkness allowed scientists to quantify changes in bird behavior.\nThe birds were counted by more than 20 volunteers. Data from National Weather Service radar helped document the density and movements of birds, and acoustic monitors recorded vocalizations.\nWhile researchers have known for more than 60 years that that powerful lights pointed at the sky attract birds, this study is useful for quantifying how far away birds are being attracted, said Travis Longcore, assistant professor of architecture, spatial sciences and biological sciences at the University of Southern California\n\"When you put up a tall tower or a tall building or lights that you shine straight up in the sky, you're not just affecting the birds that might fly over just that spot anyway. ...

The Swedish Academy likes to stun the world with its pick, but, wary of its reputation, it is seen going with a more traditional choice this year. The overall buzz, from literary circles to fortune tellers, is that the 18 Academy members in Stockholm will pick a laureate most people agree is Nobel-worthy.\n\"The Academy is actually a very discreet society and we shouldn't expect anything sensational\" this year, Clemens Poellinger, literary critic for Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, told AFP.\nAfter Gao Xingjian won in 2000 and Mo Yan in 2012, another Chinese-language author is seen as a strong contender: Yan Lianke.\nHe won the 2014 Franz Kafka Prize -- just like Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek and others often mentioned as potential winners, such as Philip Roth, Amos Oz, Haruki Murakami and Claudio Magris.\nNames that repeatedly appear in the Nobel speculation and are mentioned this year as well are Kenya's Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Syrian poet Adonis, Israel's Amos Oz and Don DeLillo of the United States.\nThe Swedish Academy will end the suspense and announce its pick on Thursday at 1:00 pm (1100 GMT).\n- Cloak-and-dagger secrecy -\nLast year's choice of US singer songwriter Bob Dylan -- who didn't comment on his win until weeks later and who snubbed the formal prize ceremony in Stockholm -- created such a stir that the Academy is likely to choose a more orthodox laureate, suggested Bjorn Wiman, cultural editor at Swedish paper of reference Dagens Nyheter.\n\"What happened last year was really unusual. This year I think it'll be a male novelist or essayist with roots in Europe. I think it's going to be the exact opposite of Bob Dylan,\" Wiman said.\nHe thinks Antonio Lobo Antunes of Portugal and Albania's Ismail Kadare have a good chance. \"Everyone will think 'Ah, of course they deserve the prize', and there'll be no objection.\"\nThe prestigious distinction could also be bestowed upon Canada's Margaret Atwood, whose novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" was recently made into a well-received television series, or Ngugi wa Thiong'o, a favourite of online betting sites.\nOr it could go to a complete unknown.\nEach February, the Academy makes a list of all the nominations it has received by those eligible to do so -- including former laureates and university professors -- before reducing it to five names in May. The members then spend the summer reading those writers, before making their choice in October.\nThe Academy is known for its cloak-and-dagger methods to prevent any leaks, resorting to code names for authors and fake book covers when reading in public.\nStockholm's literary circles therefore try to dissect the Academy members' latest interests to guess the winner -- sometimes with success but usually not.\nIn line with the last will and testament of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite who used his vast fortune to create the prizes, \"it has to be someone who deals with universal questions, someone who makes us reflect about all of us,\" explained publisher Elisabeth Grate.\n- Only 14 women -\nAnother aspect not to be overlooked is gender. Of the 113 laureates honoured since Frenchman Sully Prudhomme won in 1901, only 14 have been women.\nWiman is however not convinced that has any bearing on the Academy, recalling its claim that it does not take gender or nationality into consideration.\n\"I think it will be a man in his 70s or 80s who has written heavy novels,\" predicts Clemens Poellinger.\nAt the Hedengrens bookstore in central Stockholm, owner Nicklas Bjorkholm has already set up a wall with books by possible winners, including Spain's Javier Marias, Americans Joan Didion and Don DeLillo, Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and David Grossmann of Israel.\nHis personal favourite for the prize is Korean poet Ko Un because, he insists, \"the time has come for a non-anglophone and an Asian.\"\nEach critic may have their favourite, but they're usually off the mark.\nSo why not see what's written in the cards?\nZanna, a Tarot card reader consulted by AFP, seems to think it's Yan Lianke's year.\n\"So many pieces come together.

Because I guess Congress is thinking gun violence is out of control: 'How can we make it quieter?'\" Noah said.\n\"To the people of Las Vegas, I cannot give you thoughts and prayers. I can only say I'm sorry that we live in a world where people would put a gun before your lives,\" he said.\nCBS' James Corden, a native of England, issued his own polite call for gun control.\n\"Forgive me, because I'm just a foreigner here and some of you may feel I have no place to say this, but how does every other developed country do a better job at preventing these attacks?\" he asked.\nStephen Colbert, who regularly targets President Donald Trump, took a different approach Monday.\nAgreeing with Trump's labeling of the Las Vegas shooting as an act of \"pure evil,\" Colbert added, \"So then, what are we willing to do to combat pure evil? The answer can't be nothing.\"\nThe CBS host challenged Trump to go his own way on gun control without heeding his political party's stance.\n\"You want to make America great again? Do something the last two presidents haven't been able to do. Pass any kind of common-sense gun control legislation, that the vast majority of Americans want,\" Colbert said.\nOn TBS, Conan O'Brien said that when he started in late-night more than two decades ago it was \"practically unheard of\" for hosts to need to address a mass shooting. But things have changed, he said, a point that was driven home when his head writer presented O'Brien's previous remarks on other recent mass shootings to consider for Monday's remarks on Las Vegas.\n\"When did this become a ritual? And what does it say about us that it has?\" O'Brien said.\nAcknowledging that he's \"not the most political of our comics,\" O'Brien said he felt compelled to repeat what he said about the 2016 nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, in which 49 victims died.\n\"I don't think it should be so easy for one demented person to kill so many people so quickly. The sounds of those automatic weapons last night are grotesquely out of place in a civilized society,\" he said.\nNBC's Jimmy Fallon told viewers that in the face \"of tragedies and acts of terror, we need to remember that good still exists in this world. We're here to entertain you tonight.\" He then introduced Miley Cyrus and Adam Sandler, who performed Dido's \"No Freedom\" in honor of the shooting victims.\n___\nLynn Elber can be reached at lelber@ap.org and on Twitter at http://twitter.com/lynnelber.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/lynnelber."], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jimmy fallon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miley cyrus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "noah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen colbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy kimmel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conan o'brien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam sandler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kimmel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke combs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james corden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o'brien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor noah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lynn elber", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:49:18.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f84ae8e69f1d7ed3cb276fa18846191935525a70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJrR6Zzs8m1VMGEDOZJJKGDtBwJcZjgE46MTFgAD72NbzwIR0kEx4EKXxeNOlcpelSnpDaaeARlUDL2jFreT.qRHrabtx7IEF0", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "World | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "Post-mortem: VX poison killed brother of North Korean leader", "title_full": "Post-mortem: VX poison killed brother of North Korean leader", "published": "2017-10-03T19:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OKdzVr6FxqIjqZFmBeVgtQ--/aD0yOTk5O3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/3268015f53b047f794bab96f4f50b05e.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f84ae8e69f1d7ed3cb276fa18846191935525a70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJrR6Zzs8m1VMGEDOZJJKGDtBwJcZjgE46MTFgAD72NbzwIR0kEx4EKXxeNOlcpelSnpDaaeARlUDL2jFreT.qRHrabtx7IEF0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EILEEN NG", "published": "2017-10-03T19:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Post-mortem: VX poison killed brother of North Korean leader", "text": "SHAH ALAM, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 A Malaysian government pathologist testified Tuesday at the trial of two women accused of killing the estranged half brother of North Korea's leader that the banned VX nerve agent caused his death. His report, submitted as evidence at the trial in Malaysia's High Court, stated that VX was found not just on Kim Jong Nam's face and eyes but also in his blood, urine, clothing and bag. The 11-page report said an examination of Kim's body showed damage to his organs, including part of the brain, both lungs, his liver and spleen.\nSiti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam pleaded not guilty on Monday, the trial's first day, to killing Kim on Feb. 13 at a crowded Kuala Lumpur airport terminal. They are accused of wiping VX on Kim's face in an assassination widely thought to have been orchestrated by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nThe women have said they thought they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show and were tricked by men suspected of being North Korean agents.\nMohamad Shah Mahmood, one of two pathologists who examined Kim's body, told the court that \"the cause of death is acute VX nerve agent poisoning,\" and that there were no other contributing factors.\nThe post-mortem report said toxicology tests found traces of drugs in Kim's body used to treat diabetes, hypertension and gout. The report gave Kim's age as 46 and his name as Kim Chol, the pseudonym he used in the North Korean passport he carried at the time of his death.\nKim weighed 96 kilograms (211 pounds) and had tattoos on his chest, arms and back, including a colored dragon head breathing fire and a man with two fish-like figures, the report said.\nNorth Korea has a history of ordering killings of people it views as threats to its regime and its chemical weapons arsenal is believed to include VX. Its government has denied any role in the killing and hasn't even acknowledged the dead man was Kim Jong Nam.\nThe post-mortem report concurred with the testimony of a Malaysian government pathologist, who said Kim had extremely low levels of an enzyme vital for nervous system function in his body due to poisoning.\nChemical pathologist Nur Ashikin Othman told the court Tuesday that tests on Kim's blood showed a very low level of 344 units per liter of cholinesterase enzyme, which breaks down neurotransmitters in the body that send signals to the brain and control the muscles. The normal level is above 5,300 units per liter, she said.\nThe low level of the enzyme \"could be caused by poison such as pesticide or nerve agent,\" she said, explaining that a poison such as VX will inhibit the enzyme level, cause heart and lung problems and symptoms such as profuse sweating and vomiting.\nNur Ashikin also testified that blood tests on the two murder suspects found they had normal enzyme levels, but this may not conclusively show they were not exposed to VX because the women may have been in contact with the nerve agent at a low concentration or may have decontaminated themselves by washing their hands with soap or taken an antidote.\nGooi Soon Seng, the lawyer for Siti Aisyah, told reporters the normal enzyme levels supported their assertion that the two women were not exposed to VX.\nKim, the eldest son of the family that has ruled North Korea since its founding, had been living abroad for years. He reportedly fell out of favor with North Korea's rulers in in 2001 when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shah alam", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nur ashikin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nur ashikin othman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gooi soon seng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siti aisyah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doan thi huong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamad shah mahmood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim chol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong nam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo disneyland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:50:57.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "989012a4f2a69221a4a3203d5269eac9a30a6f13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJOuycG1PJ3o0HvTYJUjvPsecbzjM.MN0z7ED.NjTACdqvgxngVT_vEl21pm12CNuCX.KHq_2PNj5Qo04ctUfn1Wl5ewJNeXdY", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "World | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "New US ambassador to Russia meets Putin in Kremlin visit", "title_full": "New US ambassador to Russia meets Putin in Kremlin visit", "published": "2017-10-03T19:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Es4AUOcuH9WaDIf4u8V3YQ--/aD0zNTI1O3c9NTMxNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/ad138475a9a045608b7ca4ced88aa27f.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "989012a4f2a69221a4a3203d5269eac9a30a6f13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJOuycG1PJ3o0HvTYJUjvPsecbzjM.MN0z7ED.NjTACdqvgxngVT_vEl21pm12CNuCX.KHq_2PNj5Qo04ctUfn1Wl5ewJNeXdY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NATALIYA VASILYEVA", "published": "2017-10-03T19:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "New US ambassador to Russia meets Putin in Kremlin visit", "text": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 The new U.S. ambassador to Russia presented his diplomatic credentials to President Vladimir Putin at a ceremony Tuesday in the Kremlin, a move that marks the formal start of Jon Huntsman's work in Russia. Huntsman, who has twice served as a U.S. ambassador, arrived in Moscow on Monday to take over from John Tefft, who left after serving in Russia for three years, a period that was marred by a deep and rapid deterioration of ties, unseen since the end of the Cold War. The U.S.-Russia relationship has soured even further in recent months following a series of expulsions of diplomats and closures of diplomatic missions.\nIn his address to Huntsman, Putin offered Russia's condolences over Monday's deadly shooting attack in Las Vegas and expressed hope for better ties with the U.S.\n\"The current level of the ties cannot satisfy us,\" Putin said. \"We stand for constructive, predictable and mutually beneficial cooperation.\"\nPutin also said both the U.S. and Russia should not meddle in each other's \"domestic affairs.\"\nHuntsman, the former Utah governor who once called for Donald Trump to drop out of the presidential race, won easy confirmation as U.S. ambassador last week. He was the nation's top diplomat to Singapore under President George H.W. Bush and ambassador to China under President Barack Obama before returning to the U.S. to run for president in 2012.\nHuntsman had an up-and-down relationship with Trump during last year's campaign. The former governor was slow to endorse any candidate for the Republican nomination, though he did back Trump once he became the presumptive nominee. But Huntsman then called for Trump to drop out of the presidential race after the release of a 2005 audio in which Trump was captured on a microphone making lewd comments about women.\nAlthough Trump has called Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election a hoax pushed by Democrats to sully his victory at the polls, Huntsman said at his confirmation hearing last week that \"there is no question, underline, no question\" that Moscow interfered. He also said he would not hesitate to remind Russian officials that they are accountable for their actions.\nThe ambassador said in a statement released after the ceremony that he \"looks forward to working to rebuild trust between our two countries and to strengthening the bilateral relationship based on cooperation on common.\"\nHuntsman comes into office with a drastically reduced staff after the Russian Foreign Ministry ordered the U.S. to cut its embassy and consulate staff in Russia by 755 people, or by two-thirds, heightening tensions between Washington and Moscow after U.S. Congress approved sanctions against Russia.\nIn response, the U.S. suspended issuing nonimmigrant visas in Moscow for a week in August and stopped issuing visas at its consulates elsewhere in Russia.\nRelations between Russia and the United States cooled following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, where fighting since 2014 has left 10,000 people dead. Reports of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election put a further damper on hopes for better ties that the Kremlin had pinned on Trump's presidency.\nIn August, the U.S. adopted a new package of stiff financial sanctions against Russia, aimed at punishing Moscow for interfering in the U.S. election and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria, where the Kremlin has backed President Bashar Assad.\n___\nThis story corrects the day of Huntsman's arrival to Monday.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "putin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntsman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bashar assad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john tefft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon huntsman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george h.w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreign ministry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crimea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:50:58.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fcfdef8d726a35d9fbb34871eb9ecd1658a16a1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJhAc7Ezj52E0Z7X12slCjiP76bVdLgGcNuIvEvdJqiR.QYgt17FRJGdkw9gWHIOq9CCMlj.Tpl6qv3LlQZv4tjoIqc0aT1DkF", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "section_title": "World | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "Dutch prosecutors seek ban on Bandidos motorcycle club", "title_full": "Dutch prosecutors seek ban on Bandidos motorcycle club", "published": "2017-10-03T19:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fcfdef8d726a35d9fbb34871eb9ecd1658a16a1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJhAc7Ezj52E0Z7X12slCjiP76bVdLgGcNuIvEvdJqiR.QYgt17FRJGdkw9gWHIOq9CCMlj.Tpl6qv3LlQZv4tjoIqc0aT1DkF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dutch prosecutors seek ban on Bandidos motorcycle club", "text": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) \u2014 Dutch prosecutors are asking a court to outlaw the Bandidos motorcycle club and its Dutch arm, saying it's responsible for \"a culture of lawlessness\" among its members.

He is a former commander in the Khmer Rouge who later defected from the group whose genocide devastated Cambodia in the 1970s.\nStrong gains by the CNRP at local council elections in June had pointed to a tough battle for Hun Sen in next year's general election. Despite years of annual economic growth of around 7 percent, popular anger has grown over inequality and accusations of cronyism.\nIn his first comments since his arrest, Kem Sokha said in a Facebook posting on Monday that he was seeking positive change in Cambodia through the ballot box and not through revolution as charged.

Einstein did not believe they could ever be measured.\nWeiss also said that the win affirmed the importance of the scientific process at a worrying time \"when rational reasoning associated with evidence isn't universally accepted.\"\n___\n1:30 p.m.\nKip Thorne, one of three scientists sharing this year's Nobel Physics Prize for their discovery in gravitational waves, says the award is \"a win for the human race as a whole.\"\n\"These gravitational waves will be powerful ways for the human race to explore the universe - not for the next few years or decades but for the next few centuries,\" Thorne, of the California Institute of Technology, told The Associated Press.\nThorne shared the award with Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Barry Barish, also of Caltech, for their observation of faint ripples flying through the universe called gravitational waves. The waves were first predicted by Albert Einstein a century ago, but Einstein was convinced they could never be measured.\nThorne said he was a \"little disappointed\" that thousands other scientists who have worked on the project did not get to share the prize, adding: \"Nevertheless I'm tremendously pleased to accept this\" on their behalf.\n___\n1:20 p.m.\nClifford Will, a gravitational-wave expert at the University of Florida, says it was \"fabulous\" that the Nobel Physics Prize went to three scientists for their discovery in gravitational waves.\nObserving gravitational waves is important because they offer a new way to observe the universe, beyond light and particles, Will said. When two black holes merge, for example, they don't give off observable light. But with gravitational waves, \"you can see these events.\" Or rather, hear them, since they are detected as if they were chirping sounds.\nWill said that in the merger of the two black holes that triggered the prize-winning detection, the event gave off more energy in the last two-tenths of a second than all the stars in the visible universe combined emitted during the same period. But on Earth, that was \"very difficult to detect\" and required extremely precise instrumentation, he said.\n\"There's a very loud future for gravitational waves,\" he said. The next detections might come from the merger of two ultra-dense neutron stars, or a neutron star colliding with a black hole, he said.\n___\n1 p.m.\nBarry Barish, one of the scientists sharing this year's Nobel Physics Prize, said he had set an alarm in anticipation of a call from the Nobel team \u2014 though when it did come it beat his alarm.\nBarish, speaking by phone from Santa Monica, California, said he and his colleagues knew there was a good chance they would get recognized by the Nobel team. The call came at 2:41 a.m., beating his own alarm by 4 minutes.\n\"There was some anticipation. But, the Swedish Academy is so secretive,\" he told The Associated Press.\nHe added Tuesday's announcement was \"a win for Einstein, and a very big one.\"\nBarish shared the award with Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology for their discoveries in faint ripples flying through the universe called gravitational waves. The waves were first predicted by Albert Einstein a century ago, but Einstein was convinced they could never be measured.\n___\n11:55 a.m.\nThe Nobel Physics Prize 2017 has been awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in gravitational waves.\nThe three are Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Barry Barish and Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology.\nThe German-born Weiss was awarded half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize amount and Thorne and Barish will split the other half.\n___\n7:10 a.m.\nThe Nobel Physics Prize honors big discoveries involving materials often too small to be seen by the naked eye.\nThe 2017 prize being announced Tuesday by Sweden's Royal Academy of Sciences comes with 9 million kronor ($1.1 million). For the past 25 years, the prize has been shared among multiple winners.\nThe 2016 prize went to three British-born researchers who applied the mathematical discipline of topology to help understand the workings of exotic matter such as superconductors and superfluids. In 2014, a Japanese and a Canadian shared the physics prize for studies that proved that the elementary particles called neutrinos have mass.\nThis year's Nobel medicine prize went Monday to three Americans studying circadian rhythms \u2014 better known as body clocks: Jeffrey C.

Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13.\nThe women have pleaded not guilty, saying they thought they were involved in some sort of prank for a reality TV show. They face the death penalty if convicted.\nNor'ashikin Othman, a chemical pathologist with Kuala Lumpur Hospital, told the court outside Kuala Lumpur blood samples taken from the victim showed low levels of cholinesterase - an enzyme needed in muscle control - which \"could be caused by exposure to poison such as insecticide or a nerve agent\" such as VX or Sarin.\nBut she agreed with the defense that low enzyme levels could also have been due to other causes such as liver disease or the taking of female hormones by a man.\n\"Yes, the enzyme levels could be slightly lower by the taking of hormone pills by a man,\" she said.\nIn response to a question, Nor'ashikin also said it was possible the accused had had no contact with VX whatsoever as their blood samples yielded normal levels of cholinesterase.\nBut they could have also been exposed to a low dose of the poison, washed their hands with soap and water or ingested an antidote, she said.\nSiti and Huong are accused of smearing the deadly nerve agent on the victim's face and eyes. The trial has so far referred to the victim as Kim Chol, the name on the passport used by Kim Jong Nam.\nThe post mortem report, made available to the media, said that VX was detected on swabs of Kim Jong Nam's eyes and face, in the blood, plasma and urine.\nThe report described the victim's body as covered with tattoos. These include a large black tattoo on the chest of a man with two fish-like fingers, and one of \"abstract-like motifs\" on his upper right arm that extends to his upper back.\nPolice have also named four North Koreans as suspects in the case and an Interpol red notice, an international alert just short of an arrest warrant, has been issued for the four, who remain at large.\nThe trial continues on Wednesday.\n(Reporting by Rozanna Latiff, Writing by Joseph Sipalan; Editing by Nick Macfie)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph sipalan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick macfie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "othman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siti aisyah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doan thi huong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim chol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong nam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rozanna latiff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interpol", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:51:53.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "375032b12ea1851bd54d00c0b84319ac89f77480", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTueMYICVUfckKKsNVV9UO3w1Lwk9Dc7mLnVUnFPlIdibsuEmb1V2dTVHrgTVxSuYJkrfXAhlq36T2_gDedMsnU", "site_full": "answers.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://answers.yahoo.com/dir/index?link=over&sid=2115500189&more=1&s=date", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Technology | Yahoo Answers", "title": "What is the most \"robot proof\" job?", "title_full": "What is the most \"robot proof\" job? | Yahoo Answers", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "/static/images/answers-icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "946b82ea0a7f9ac2d099ca89b82978c3caf8c3f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTueMYICVUfckKKsNVV9UO3w1Lwk9Dc7mLnVUnFPlIdibsuEmb1V2dTVHrgTVxSuYJkrfXAhlq36SUl.K8LRrqzInvVakhbwt4-", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "Nathan", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "nurse and doctor.

The comments drew an angry condemnation from the Palestinians and created a new test for the Trump administration, which has been working for over eight months to restart peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.\nBenjamin Netanyahu said during a visit to Maaleh Adumim that he was announcing a period of \"enhanced development.\"\n\"We will build thousands of housing units here,\" he said. \"We will add the industrial zone needed and the expansion needed to allow for the advanced development of this place.\"\n\"This place will be part of the state of Israel,\" he added.\nNetanyahu gave no specifics or timetable, suggesting that his comments may have been playing to his nationalistic base.\nFacing a series of corruption investigations, Netanyahu has stepped up his hard-line rhetoric in recent weeks with attacks on the media and appeals to his core supporters. This has included two other speeches in West Bank settlements where he vowed never to uproot any of them.\nThe Palestinians seek the West Bank, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as part of a future independent state and consider all of Israel's settlements to be illegal \u2014 a position that is widely shared by the international community. Israel says the settlements' fate should be resolved through negotiations.\nMaaleh Adumim is a settlement of roughly 40,000 people just east of Jerusalem. It is considered strategic because it lies in the center of the West Bank, and making it part of Israel could greatly hinder Palestinian statehood aspirations.\nNabil Shaath, a senior adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called Netanyahu's comments \"totally unacceptable.\"\n\"This is an attempt by Netanyahu to destroy the two-state solution and a clear refusal of any attempt to revive the peace process, especially by the United States,\" he said.\nPresident Donald Trump has taken a softer line toward the settlements than his predecessors, and his key advisers, including son-in-law Jared Kushner and ambassador to Israel David Friedman, have longstanding ties to the settlement movement. Even so, Trump has still asked Israel to show restraint.\nEarly this year, Israel shelved a proposal to annex Maaleh Adumim under apparent pressure from the White House.

The extremist group is trying to rally supporters after months of battlefield setbacks in Syria and Iraq, including the loss of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in July.\nThe U.S.-led coalition and allied Syrian forces say they are in the final stages of driving IS from Raqqa, once the de facto capital of the group's self-styled caliphate. On Tuesday, Syrian activists said airstrikes hit the last water wells operating in the city, killing over a dozen civilians.\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 18 civilians were killed, while Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, another activist-run group, put the death toll at 21. There was no immediate comment from the coalition.\nIn the IS video, circulated on social media, one of the prisoners identifies himself and says he and his colleague, who appears badly beaten, were captured near al-Shula during an IS counteroffensive. The speaker does not say when they were captured.\nRussia's Defense Ministry says no Russian servicemen have been captured in Syria. It was not possible to verify the authenticity of the video or confirm the identities of the individuals shown in it.\nRussia is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose troops have been advancing in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour, where al-Shula is located, against IS under the cover of Russian airstrikes since early September.\nThe jihadists launched a fierce attack on al-Shula last week, briefly cutting off a major highway and sparking a two-day battle. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, said the fighting killed 120 Syrian troops, Hezbollah fighters and other pro-government gunmen.\nIn Monday's attack in the Syrian capital, two men stormed a police station in the al-Midan neighborhood before one of them blew himself up, according to Syria's interior minister, Lt. Gen. Mohammad al-Shaar. He said the other bomber made it inside the compound, where police killed him, causing his bomb to explode.\nThe IS-run Aamaq news agency said the militant group carried out the attack, without providing further details.\nThe Syrian government is at war with the IS group as well as a local al-Qaida affiliate and an array of rebel groups trying to oust Assad. The military has been steadily claiming territory from IS in central and eastern Syria recently.\nRussia's Defense Ministry said in a statement early Tuesday that its airstrikes just outside Deir el-Zour city killed more than 300 IS fighters and wounded more than 200 on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River.
