Erin Finan and wife Leah Finan were certainly partial to a freebie or two, the only problem being they were obtaining them via fraudulent means. \nThe Indianapolis couple this week formally admitted to stealing $1.2 million worth of items from online retail giant Amazon in a crime that could land them with lengthy spells in prison when they\u2019re sentenced in November. Oh, and they have to pay back the money, too. \nThe Finans, both 37, were charged with the crime earlier this year after it was discovered they\u2019d defrauded Amazon out of a huge range of goods that included GoPro cameras , Microsoft Xboxes, Samsung smartwatches , and Microsoft Surface tablets. \nCourt documents showed that the pair took possession of the delivered goods by falsely claiming they were damaged or not working. They would then request and sometimes receive a replacement at no charge, the United States attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of Indiana explained in a release . \n\u201cAmazon\u2019s customer service policy allows, under certain circumstances, customers to receive a replacement before they return a broken item,\u201d the release said, suggesting the originally received item was never returned. For Amazon, it\u2019s sometimes more cost-effective to replace items following such claims, rather than investigate them. The company has safeguards in place to flag up potential violators of the system, but the Finans reportedly got around this by creating \u201chundreds\u201d of false identities. \nAnd the story doesn\u2019t end there. \nReceiving more goods than they knew what to do with, the couple passed some of the stolen items to an alleged accomplice in New York named Danijel Glumac, who earlier this year was charged with interstate transportation of stolen property and money laundering. \n\u201cThe Finans allegedly sold the stolen electronics out of their van to Glumac at a price substantially below their retail value,\u201d the release said. \u201cGlumac then marked them up and sold and shipped them to the New York entity, which in turn sold them to the public. Glumac also allegedly advised the Finans on how to evade detection by Amazon,\u201d the U.S. attorney\u2019s office said. \nIt reported that in total, Glumac allegedly made more than $1.2 million via sales of the goods, paying around $725,000 to the Finans. \nThe couple recently pleaded guilty to mail fraud and money laundering in a U.S. District Court in Indianapolis, with sentencing hearings set for November 9. \nBoth charges carry a maximum jail time of 20 years. Under the terms of a plea agreement, the Finans will be ordered to pay Amazon the total value of the goods \u2014 $1,218,504 \u2014 making the \u201cfreebies\u201d possibly the most expensive ever received.

The Nuraphone headphones are engineered to account for this, making sure you're getting the best possible sound. \nNo matter how good a pair of headphones is, and no matter how much care goes into the engineering and design, the simple truth is your own hearing capabilities play a huge role in your experience with them. Nura\u2019s newly launched Nuraphone headphones have been crafted with the aim of adapting audio playback to your own hearing, incorporating novel technology and a hybrid in-ear-meets-over-ear design for better sound. \nThe big draw here is the ability to adjust the sound equalization to your hearing. Nura says the Nuraphone uses otoacoustics emissions (OAE) \u2014 a phenomenon produced within the cochlea, the organ located in the inner ear that changes waves entering the ear into the signals sent to the brain \u2014 to \u201clearn\u201d and adjust to your hearing ability. The brand claims the headphones then sonically \u201cmolds\u201d the sound signature for the best possible sound quality. \nThe process is interesting; the Nuraphone\u2019s drivers play a range of different tones, sending sound to the cochlea, wherein three tiny bones vibrate and convert the sound into signals that are sent to the brain. But the vibration also reverberates back through the ear canal to the eardrum, which acts as a \u201cspeaker,\u201d emitting those tiny OAEs. The Nuraphones pick up those OAEs, and then an app adjusts the playback EQ (the app will be available for both iOS and Android devices). This information is then saved on the app, which can store up to three separate profiles. Once that data is stored, the headphones are said to able to automatically recognize who is wearing the headphones. \nBest of all, the entire process is automatic, and completes within 60 seconds. It\u2019s an exciting feature if it works as advertised, and there\u2019s more to these headphones than EQ adjustment technology as well. The Nuraphone headphones are designed as a hybrid between in-ear and over-ear headphones. According to Nura, this design allows the melodic channels to be directed to the inner-ear portion of the headphones, while the over-ear section delivers bass via physical vibration through your skin, which the company says prevents any one part of the mix overpowering another, and allows users to adjust the sound isolation through the app. \nThe Nuraphone can handle both wired and wireless connections, supporting Bluetooth with AptX and AptX HD for Android users, and features a 20-hour battery life when used wirelessly. Wired connectivity includes standard 3.5mm connection as well as Apple Lightning, USB-A, USB-C, and micro-USB connection. A USB-A cord is included in the retail package, while other cables can be purchased optionally. In addition to the Nuraphone and USB-A cable, the Nuraphone will also ship with a magnetically sealed carrying case. \nThe Nuraphone are available now for $400. You can learn more about them on Nura\u2019s official website.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nuraphon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nuraphone", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "oae", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nuraphone", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:17:35.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2842ce6c1e132958e830f9da2d6fa61396a3eb3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBLBiC2Od_jZJiCosMjwWdxmiPfuDtUF4g8AuPE.kLHrQjQMzvvdcBzxj1R7CnV5s3tkzqud.U8k9KqC1RQu0p7pwrzA6wLZIc", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bowers and Wilkins PX Headphones Hands-on Review | Digital Trends", "title_full": "Bowers and Wilkins PX Headphones Hands-on Review | Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-03T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.176, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/bowers-and-wilkins-px-feat-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2842ce6c1e132958e830f9da2d6fa61396a3eb3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBLBiC2Od_jZJiCosMjwWdxmiPfuDtUF4g8AuPE.kLHrQjQMzvvdcBzxj1R7CnV5s3tkzqud.U8k9KqC1RQu0p7pwrzA6wLZIc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andy Boxall", "published": "2017-10-03T07:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bowers and Wilkins PX Headphones Hands-on Review | Digital Trends", "text": "Bowers and Wilkins PX Bowers and Wilkins has launched its first pair of noise canceling Bluetooth headphones, the PX, and they have been a long time in the making. This is due to waiting for Bluetooth audio quality to meet its standards, and with the AptX HD codec, it has. Bowers and Wilkins has used last year\u2019s P9 Signature high-end headphones for inspiration, bringing some of the special design aspects and technology seen in them over to the PX. Despite this, they are considerably more affordable. However, it\u2019s the new noise-canceling technology that will define them, and in our Bowers and Wilkins PX hands-on review, we find out how they perform. Inside the Bowers and Wilkins PX \nThe PX draws on the acoustic design in the P9 Signature. For example, the drive unit sits in an angled plate, so the driver \u2014 which is also closely related to the one inside the P9 Signature \u2014 naturally points towards the center of your ear for an improved soundstage. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends \nIt also brings other advantages, such as having more material to stiffen the structure of the cup itself The cups have a stiff and light composite structure, and the driver is designed to retain its shape, yet still have plenty of movement for extra bass. All this lets Bowers and Wilkins carefully tune the final sound of the headphones. \nThe noise canceling technology is Bowers and Wilkins\u2019 own, and it\u2019s the result of several years development, as the company wanted to avoid the drawback of losing the life, verve, and spaciousness often associated with noise-canceled music. There are three modes: Office, City, and Flight. Office provides the minimal noise cancellation, and Flight the most. \nWith the transparency mode turned up, we could very clearly the voice of someone facing and speaking to us \nThere\u2019s also a transparency mode specifically turned to let voices through. This feature is directional, and by using the microphone array inside the headphones, prioritizes voices from people facing the wearer. This means you won\u2019t hear people nearby, but will hear someone addressing you directly. \nSensors inside the headphones give the PX\u2019s a smart control system. When you put them on, they restart your music from where you paused previously. If you lift an ear cup or hang them around your neck, they automatically pause. If you take them off and place them down on a table, the headphones slowly power down into a deep sleep mode, extending the battery life for many hours. \nUsed continuously, the PX headphones should return 22 hours before needing a recharge, but under normal use conditions where they\u2019re paused and removed repeatedly, this should extend to 50 hours. This places the PX among the best-performing noise-canceling headphones we\u2019ve ever tested. How do they sound? \nOur initial hands-on/ears-on took place in an already quiet room, but conversation was instantly removed from the headphones using the noise-canceling Flight mode, and moderately audible using Office. However, turn the transparency mode up, and when facing someone speaking to us, the voice came through very clearly. \nNoise cancellation modes are changed through an app or by using a physical button on the side of the headphone cup. There are no capacitive touch-based controls here like there are on the Sony MDR-1000X . \nWhile there was a slight difference in the sound signature with noise cancellation switched on, it was minimal, showing what a great job Bowers and Wilkins have done with the technology. With noise canceling switched off, the headphones have a rich, subtle sound to them. \nAndy Boxall/Digital Trends \nAudio was demonstrated using an iPhone 7. The mid-range response is prominent, and the soundstage very wide and airy. Subtleties in the music aren\u2019t lost when noise cancellation is switched on, with the strumming and slapping of strings in an acoustic guitar-heavy piece sounding very realistic. \nBowers and Wilkins has used the AptX HD codec inside the PX, which it considers the best possible wireless sound format available. The Bluetooth technology also gives Bowers and Wilkins complete control over all the audio elements inside the PX, and because it doesn\u2019t have to deal with different amplifiers, DACs, and other in-device components that influence wired headphones, it can make sure the sound produced by the PX headphones meets its expectations. \nWhile AptX HD is excellent, it\u2019s also limited in its availability. The format is currently supported by very few smartphones \u2014 the LG G6 , LG V3 0, and OnePlus 5 \u2014 and music players including several from Astell & Kern .

The experiment that proved its viability utilized a Chinese satellite specifically launched for conducting quantum physics experiments. \nEncryption became a major talking point in the wake of the 2013 Edward Snowden revelations and has continued through this day as people search for ever greater security for their personal communications. Services like WhatsApp utilize end-to-end encryption, but as secure as that is, quantum encryption is far, far more complicated and effectively impossible to crack. \nDue to the nature of quantum mechanics, if the quantum key that is generated to obfuscate a message \u2014 in this case a video call \u2014 were viewed by an outside party, its content would change, thereby rendering it useless. That would, in turn, inform those who sent and received the message that it was potentially intercepted, too. \nTo generate such a key, researchers at the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences , sent \u201cphotons\u201d from the Chinese Micius satellite to ground stations on the Earth. \n\u201cThe single photons with their various polarizations were [\u2026] transmitted as a sequence of ones and zeros to the ground station near the Austrian city of Graz,\u201d explained researchers . \u201cThere, the polarization states were measured and compared randomly with the sequence sent by the satellite.\u201d \nThe same procedure was then repeated on the ground, effectively creating two quantum keys. These were stored on the satellite, combined during orbit and then retransmitted to Earth. With a copy of the combined key at both ends of the eventual call, the researchers were able to verify the communication was legitimate. \nWhen the video call between Vienna and Beijing took place, the researchers had no problem encrypting and decrypting the information both ways.

Android rooting opens up a world of possibility, but it can also void your warranty, leave you with a broken smartphone, or worse. It isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. \nManufacturers and carriers have a vested interest in dissuading you from rooting \u2014 if done incorrectly, it can irreparably damage your phone. Even so, the potential benefits are well worth it. With a rooted phone, you can remove bloatware, speed up your processor, and customize every element of your phone software\u2019s appearance. \nThis guide on how to root Android devices will walk you through the necessary steps to root your phone. Some devices can be rooted in minutes. Others take a little research. But one thing is clear: Rooting your phone is one of the best ways to tap into your Android device\u2019s true potential. What is rooting ? \nRooting an Android phone or tablet is akin to jailbreaking an iPhone \u2014 basically, it allows you to dive deeper into a phone\u2019s sub-system. It will allow you to access the entirety of the operating system to customize just about anything on your Android device. With root access, you can also get around any restrictions that your manufacturer or carrier may have applied. \nRooting is best undertaken with caution. You will want to back up your phone\u2019s software before you install \u2014 or \u201cflash,\u201d in rooting terms \u2014 a custom ROM (modified version of Android). Why would you root? \nOne of the biggest incentives to root your Android device is to rid yourself of bloatware that\u2019s impossible to uninstall otherwise (although you can sometimes disable it \u2014 check out our guide on disabling bloatware ). On some devices, rooting will enable previously disabled settings, like wireless tethering. Additional benefits include the ability to install specialized tools and flash custom ROMs, each of which can add extra features and improve your phone or tablet\u2019s performance. \nThere are not an overabundance of must-have root apps, but there are enough to make it worthwhile. Some apps, for example, let you to automatically back up all of your apps and data to the cloud, block web and in-app advertisements, create secure tunnels to the internet, overclock your processor, and make your device a wireless hot spot. Here is a list of some of the best apps for rooted devices . Why wouldn\u2019t you root? \nThere are essentially four potential cons to rooting your Android. Voiding your warranty: Some manufacturers or carriers will void your warranty if you root your device, so it is worth keeping in mind that you can always unroot. If you need to send the device back for repair, simply flash the software backup you made and it\u2019ll be good as new. Bricking your phone: If something goes wrong during the rooting process, you run the risk of bricking \u2014 i.e., corrupting \u2014 your device. The easiest way to prevent that from happening is to follow the instructions carefully. Make sure the guide you are following is up to date and that the custom ROM you flash is specifically for it. If you do your research, you won\u2019t have to worry about bricking your smartphone. Security risks: Rooting introduces some security risks. Depending on what services or apps you use on your device, it could create a security vulnerability. And certain malware takes advantage of rooted status to steal data, install additional malware, or target other devices with harmful web traffic. Disabled apps: Some security-conscious apps and services do not work on rooted devices \u2014 financial platforms like Google\u2019s Android Pay and Barclays Mobile Banking do not support them. Apps that serve copyrighted TV shows and movies, like Sky Go and Virgin TV Anywhere, will not start on rooted devices, either.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barclays mobile banking", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:31:30.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74b346e4831f69518d52a55ad2964b4a80a82496", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXAE_7DCaJzQ1VNE2pnMZXnLsQf69CkW2Dk.wJCMwNYUDM_shZuLbhIE", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Mobile\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Are you ready for a browser cleanup?

The HTC Vive and Oculus Rift need to be connected to a computer to work. All provide great VR experiences, but where is the in-between? What is the VR solution for someone who doesn\u2019t have the requisite phone, or a high-powered computer? Newcomer Oqtagon hopes it has the answer with its Razergon VR headset, a wireless standalone VR system launched on Kickstarter . \nOqtagon\u2019s quest with the Razergon headset is to make a affordable headset that\u2019s easy to use, provides a great VR experience, and doesn\u2019t require specific hardware to work. The result is a headset that operates like a Gear VR or Daydream VR, but with the phone, or brains, permanently fixed inside. In front of your eyes are lenses providing a 2,560 x 1,440 pixel resolution image, which is the same provided by a Samsung Galaxy S8 or Pixel XL , only here it\u2019s LCD rather than OLED. The field of view is listed as 90 degrees, slightly lower than Samsung\u2019s Gear VR. \nThe device is made from ABS plastic to keep the weight down, and covered in a metallic paint finish. An unnamed quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM power the Razergon VR \u2014 remember, the chip isn\u2019t doing anything else other than running the headset, so power shouldn\u2019t be a problem \u2014 and it has a Mali 764 graphics processor alongside. The headset has 6GB of internal storage, a MicroSD card slot, a headphone jack, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, an HDMI-out, and its own battery charged with a Micro USB cable. The specification list could easily be taken from a smartphone. Software and controls \nA custom version of Android operates the Razergon VR headset, with access to Google Play, and a separate controller is used to navigate the operating system, and to play games. It has buttons, a trigger, and motion sensors, similar to the Google Daydream controller. Like Gear VR, there is a capacitive touchpad on the side of the headset itself. The internal battery is expected to last for four hours before needing a recharge. The headset can be tethered to your phone, but as yet there are no apps taking advantage of that feature, while the Bluetooth connection will link headphones, keyboards, and mice to the headset. \nThat covers the technical side of the headset, but the success of any VR headset comes down to the software, apps, and experiences available for it. Digital Trends asked Oqtagon co-founder Galen Law-Kun what we could expect to play and watch on the headset. He told us, \u201cThe headset is compatible with Cardboard VR Apps, we\u2019re still working on integrating Daydream applications. The whole operating system will take some time to mature and we\u2019re slowly adding new features as we get user feedback.\u201d \nThe cheapest Razergon VR headset is $220 if you\u2019re quick to back the Kickstarter campaign. The limited software support is a concern, but the headset isn\u2019t expected to ship until February next year, so there is time for it to be improved before then. It needs Daydream VR support at a minimum, in our opinion, but the LCD screen inside the headset may cause problems with this, as Daydream\u2019s minimum phone specification requires OLED.

T-Mobile has been called out for some questionable messaging around being the fastest network available. As such, the National Advertising Division (NAD) , an arm of the Advertising Self-Regulatory Council (ASRC), an advertising industry trade association, \u201crecommended that T-Mobile discontinue certain advertising claims\u201d around the Uncarrier\u2019s 4G LTE network. \nAs a T-Mobile spokesperson told Digital Trends, NAD recommended that the company refrain from claiming network superiority over Verizon based on the data it initially submitted. In previous advertisements, T-Mobile used crowdsourced data from Ookla and Open Signal to claim that it had the \u201cFastest 4G LTE network.\u201d However, Verizon pointed out that the folks who use these apps are a \u201csubset of all smartphone users,\u201d and that the data was likely skewed. \nAll the same, T-Mobile is holding strong to its claim of having a faster network, telling us, \u201cWe took [NAD\u2019s] recommendation into account, looked at the newest third-party data, and found that it still shows T-Mobile has the fastest network. We will continue to make this claim.\u201d \nIn general, NAD noted in its announcement that advertisers ought to \u201cregularly monitor and reexamine their advertising claims to make certain that the underlying data upon which they are based is current so that their advertising claims are truthful, and recognizes that changes to a network or network service conditions will impact whether a service provider\u2019s comparative claims are supported.\u201d \nThe advertising watchdog often hands down decisions that can be used in lieu of a courtroom drama \u2014 after all, Verizon decided to take its case to NAD rather than suing its competitor over erroneous claims. That said, NAD points out that its recommendations do not constitute a \u201cfinding of wrongdoing,\u201d and further noted that \u201can advertiser\u2019s voluntary discontinuance or modification of claims should not be construed as an admission of impropriety.\u201d \nAll the same, Verizon can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that T-Mobile is no longer at its throat regarding network speed and newness.

The rumored U11 Life may bring some of the U11's best features to a phone that better fits in your hand. \nHTC won plenty of new fans with the HTC U11 , a capable smartphone with unusual squeezable bezels. But the Taiwan-based company isn\u2019t finished yet. If rumors are to be believed, it\u2019ll release a new phone before 2018 that\u2019s similar to the U11: U11 Life. It\u2019s not expected to be especially groundbreaking, but it\u2019ll likely bring many of the features that make the U11 desirable to a reasonably priced, smaller form factor. \nHere\u2019s what we think we know about it. Design \nThe HTC U11 looks stunning from the back, thanks to the eye-catching 3D liquid glass finish. We don\u2019t know if the U11 Life will have the same color-shifting design, as the only leaked image of the phone so far shows it from the front. But there\u2019s a definite family resemblance between it and the U11. \nA physical home button in the lower bezel doubles as a fingerprint sensor. The U11 Life\u2019s screen itself is expected to measure 5.2-inches and have a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution, according to Android Authority . And it might be quite durable too \u2014 it\u2019s rumored to have a IP67 water and dust resistance rating, matching that of the HTC U11 and the Apple iPhone 7 . Specs \nThe U11 Life might not measure up to the U11 in raw power, but many of the U11\u2019s best hardware features are reportedly present and accounted for. \nIn early October, Twitter user LlabTooFer published the U11\u2019s preliminary specifications. According to the list, HTC\u2019s budget smartphone has a midrange Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 paired with 3GB or 4GB of RAM, depending on the model; a 2,600mAh battery; and 32GB or 64GB of internal storage.

Luckily, Lystr is here to help us all. \nWith all of the other lists you\u2019re creating and keeping tabs on in your head, the last thing you need is a complicated grocery list, too. Luckily, there\u2019s a new app that wants to take all the thinking out of shopping \u2014 for food, that is. Meet Lystr , a new Internet of Things product that just made its Kickstarter debut , and aims to take the hassle out of your grocery shopping. \nAnytime you realize you\u2019re running low on an essential kitchen supply like milk, olive oil, or eggs, simply tell your new connected device something like, \u201cHey Lystr, add milk.\u201d If you want to remember an exact brand of a product, you can use Lystr\u2019s sensor to scan the item\u2019s bar code. No matter which method you opt for, the item will automatically be added to your shopping list so the next time you make a trip to the store, you won\u2019t be wracking your brain trying to remember what you forgot. \nThe companion Lystr smartphone app contains the entirety of your grocery list, and you can share the contents of said list with any of your contacts, or email it to your personal assistant (if you\u2019re lucky enough to have one). \nLystr founder Kara Scanlin sees the product as the equivalent of Amazon Alexa or Dash . Rather than talking to an Amazon Echo, you\u2019ll be talking to a discreet device that plugs into any outlet in your kitchen, and can be taken just about anywhere you go. \n\u201cWe put an insane attention to detail in designing the product,\u201d Scanlin noted of the design process. \u201cI\u2019m picky, and I know my customer is picky about what they put in their kitchen, so we had to make it beautiful.\u201d \nAnd it\u2019s certainly pretty sleek. The small disk blends in easily with just about any kitchen decor, but its functionality is certainly something you won\u2019t want to miss out on. You can now pre-order a Lystr from Kickstarter for the early-bird price of $79, with an estimated shipment date of November 2017.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lystr", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kara scanlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scanlin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon echo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon alexa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kickstarter", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:02:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d2a14a9acc1dd6879e2598caf4f7e4630436a38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBvcBE7gfhNaScX8a.TAgx4.vGUr9lp07gdpkUlZ8_njS20AIjvlLDdBoSsvQx2F.A756GdCflN7Pp8SC28EzI5Q--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "https://news.google.com/news/feeds?pz=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&topic=tc&output=rss", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Technology - Google News", "title": "10 million saw Facebook political ads posted from Russia-linked fake accounts - Digital Trends", "title_full": "10 million saw Facebook political ads posted from Russia-linked fake accounts - Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-03T20:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/47157990_ml-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 55, "comments": 0, "shares": 55}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d2a14a9acc1dd6879e2598caf4f7e4630436a38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBvcBE7gfhNaScX8a.TAgx4.vGUr9lp07gdpkUlZ8_njS20AIjvlLDdBoSsvQx2F.A756GdCflN7Pp8SC28EzI5Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T20:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "10 million saw Facebook political ads posted from Russia-linked fake accounts - Digital Trends", "text": "Home > Social Media > 10 million saw Facebook political ads posted from\u2026 10 million saw Facebook political ads posted from Russia-linked fake accounts   Why it matters to you Around 10 million people saw at least one of the ads that came from inauthentic accounts, so Facebook is developing new plans to curb future abuse. \nOn Monday, October 2, Facebook shared data with Congress on over 3,000 Facebook political ads that came from fake Russian accounts during and after the 2016 presidential election. Now, the social media platform is sharing that data with users , along with what steps the company is taking next to curb similar attempts in the future. \nFacebook says that it found over 3,000 ads that came from inauthentic accounts linked to a Russian group called the Internet Research Agency that operated between 2015 and 2017. Some 10 million people in the U.S. viewed at least one of those ads, with around 44 percent of those views happening before the Nov. 8, 2016 election. The ads, as well as the spread of fake news during the election , have brought the social media platform under scrutiny. \n\u201cThe 2016 US election was the first where evidence has been widely reported that foreign actors sought to exploit the internet to influence voter behavior,\u201d wrote Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy and communications. \u201cWe understand more about how our service was abused and we will continue to investigate to learn all we can. We know that our experience is only a small piece of a much larger puzzle.\u201d \nFacebook says its advertising guidelines are designed to prevent abuse without inhibiting free speech \u2014 for example, preventing advertisers from advertising globally to other countries would prevent organizations like UNICEF and Oxfam from communicating with global audiences. All of the ads in question violated policy because they came from inauthentic accounts, but Facebook says the content inside some of them would have been approved if the information had come from an authentic account. \n\u201cWe strongly believe free speech and free elections depend upon each other,\u201d Schrage wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re fast developing both standards and greater safeguards against malicious and illegal interference on our platform. We\u2019re strengthening our advertising policies to minimize and even eliminate abuse. Why? Because we are mindful of the importance and special place political speech occupies in protecting both democracy and civil society. We are dedicated to being an open platform for all ideas \u2014 and that may sometimes mean allowing people to express views we \u2014 or others \u2014 find objectionable. This has been the longstanding challenge for all democracies: how to foster honest and authentic political speech while protecting civic discourse from manipulation and abuse.\u201d \nWith the data, Facebook also shared a list of next steps the platform is taking to catch ads like those from the so-called Internet Research Agency \u2014 which violated Facebook policy but ran anyway \u2014 in the future. Facebook will be adding 1,000 people to its staff to manually review more ads, looking at content as well as context and targeted demographics. Ads that target certain demographics will automatically be flagged for manual review, Facebook says, after both the election ads and the inappropriate user-typed demographics that snuck into the system . The platform currently uses both algorithms and human reviewers, reviewing millions of ads every week. \nThe platform is also taking steps to help users better determine where an ad came from. In the name of transparency, users will soon be able to click on an ad targeted to them and also view ads targeted toward other demographics, a feature that Facebook is currently building. Expanded advertising policies are also coming. For Pages that want to run ads related to U.S. federal elections, Facebook will be requiring more documentation confirming the business or organization. The social media giant is also reaching out to industry leaders and other governments to establish industry standards, continuing efforts like the partnership with Twitter, Microsoft, and YouTube designed to fight extremist content. \nSince the U.S. election, the platform has also taken steps to curb fake news in elections in Germany and the U.K.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "schrage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elliot schrage", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxfam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "internet research agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unicef", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:30:58.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "907a7a7e6df62074802f8eeaa0e1912402e0566a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeMbyaeUFZ4bCj6L_oz1ht8z3GfHVQrEwOA--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Mobile\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "8 Infamous tech flops that were way ahead of their time", "title_full": "8 Infamous tech flops that were way ahead of their time", "published": "2017-10-03T21:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/power_glove_us-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 294, "comments": 5, "shares": 294}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 6}, "linkedin": {"shares": 96}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "907a7a7e6df62074802f8eeaa0e1912402e0566a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeMbyaeUFZ4bCj6L_oz1ht8z3GfHVQrEwOA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Luke Dormehl", "published": "2017-10-03T21:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "8 Infamous tech flops that were way ahead of their time", "text": "Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you These ideas may have flopped on first release, but in retrospect they turned out to be right on the money. Despite losing a bunch of it at the time. \nNot every tech product can be a winner in the marketplace, but some failures don\u2019t deserve to be thought of as disasters. Whether it\u2019s a good idea executed badly, a great product that was too expensive, or simply a futuristic idea which was way ahead of its time; here are eight tech flops which were later revisited more successfully. \nNoble failures of tech, we salute you! Apple\u2019s Newton MessagePad (1993) \nA line of personal data assistants (PDAs), the portable Newton MessagePad was supposed to be Apple\u2019s next big hit after the Macintosh. Arriving in 1993, the $699 first-gen device offered handwriting recognition able to recognize 10,000 words right out of the box, some impressive AI abilities for scheduling meetings, infrared technology for \u201cbeaming\u201d data to other devices, and a whole lot more. \nUnfortunately, it never really caught on. Despite Apple launching a number of new models which got progressively better, a combination of early negative press and lack of easy internet connectivity meant the MessagePad is considered one of the biggest flops in Apple history. \nAfter all, a pricey mobile device built by Apple ? What kind of a nut would think that could be a hit? LaserDisc (1978) \nAnyone who thinks that DVD was the first disc-based home video format needs to think again! Launched all the way back in 1978, LaserDiscs offered far superior image and sound quality to VHS tapes, and pioneered the kind of movie \u201cextras\u201d which later became a key part of DVD and BluRay presentations. \nUnfortunately, the discs themselves were easy to damage, the expensive LaserDisc players could be excessively loud, and there was no way to record TV shows with them. They eventually sputtered out in the 1990s. Sony Glasstron (1996) \nCosting $900 ($1,350 today), the Sony Glasstron was a head-mounted display which promised to replicate \u201cthe viewing experience of a 52-inch TV at 6.5 feet.\u201d Inside were twin 0.55-inch LCD screens, each one boasting a resolution of 180,000 pixels. \nSlap on a pair of stereo speaker earbuds, chow down on some popcorn, and \u2014 from your perspective \u2014 it was like you were sitting in a real movie theater. From else\u2019s perspective, you looked like a bit of a dork. Oh, and it probably made you feel a bit nauseous, too. \nRegardless, it\u2019s the ancestor of today\u2019s more successful generation of VR headsets . Polaroid Polavision (1977) \nImagine being able to take the instant approach to photography pioneered by Polaroid, and apply it to moving pictures. That doesn\u2019t sound too spectacular in an age in which entire movies have been shot on smartphones, but it certainly sounded pretty impressive back in 1977. \nPolavision included a camera, film, and movie viewer that let you rapidly develop your motion picture and screen it. The problem was that the movies included no sound, ran just 2.5 minutes each, and required incredibly bright light to film, due to the slow film speed. Most people went with Super 8 cameras in the short term \u2014 even though this required sending your films off to be developed. Later on, both were replaced by VHS tapes and the arrival of the camcorder. WebTV and MSN TV (1996) \nFrom the nostalgic sounds of the dial-up tone to Usenet newsgroups to the fact that we ever thought looping MIDI themes were a good quality for a website to possess, there\u2019s plenty about the early days of the internet that we look back on with rose-tinted glasses. Something that nobody remembers fondly? Attempts to use televisions as makeshift monitors for accessing the web. \nWhile it sounded cool and high tech, clumsy controls interfaces and the generally horrible resolution of 1990s TV sets meant that this was more an exercise in frustration than anything else. The most notable attempt at a web-connected set-top box was WebTV , which offered TV-based e-mail and internet browsing via a wireless keyboards. \nIt was later rebranded as MSN TV by Microsoft, but failed to catch on under any name with customers. Today, of course, smart TVs are pretty much everywhere . AT&T Picturephone (1970) \nThere was once a time when the idea of a videophone seemed every bit as futuristic and impossible as teleportation and flying cars. One of the companies that tried to change that? AT&T with its Picturephone service, launched commercially way back on June 30, 1970. \nFor the bargain price of just $160 a month (around $1,000 in today\u2019s prices), plus 25 cents per minute after a \u201cfree\u201d half hour, users could call one of the other hundred or Picturephones scattered around the U.S. It didn\u2019t exactly take off, although services like Skype and FaceTime show that AT&T was definitely thinking along the right lines. Sega Dreamcast (1998) \nIt still physically pains us that the Dreamcast is not only considered a commercial flop, but that it brought an end to the videogame glory days in which Sega was a maker of brilliant hardware, instead of a publisher churning out terrible Sonic the Hedgehog games. \nThe Dreamcast may have represented the end of an era in some ways, but it was incredibly forward-looking in other regards. The biggest one: including a modem in every console to allow gamers from around the world to play against each other, participate in leaderboards, chat, or download content. And all back in the heady days of 1998! Power Glove (1989) \nIt seems unimaginable that a product called the \u201cPower Glove\u201d could have ever been a commercial failure, but somehow it was. Launched by Mattel as a NES accessory in 1989, it offered users a new way of interacting with Nintendo games by way of various gestures. \nAlthough it became a cult hit, it failed to sell at the time \u2014 and, as with several of the technologies on this list, didn\u2019t work quite as well as advertised. Nonetheless, it\u2019s pretty clear that this is the same concept that would later be more successfully adopted for technologies like the Wiimote , the PS move, and motion controllers for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "newton messagepad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "msn tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "polaroid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mattel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "polaroid polavision", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "webtv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sony glasstron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "at&t picturephone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "at&t", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facetime", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:38:28.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a5667b717f15a4e66415aec3464dfd812980f9e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeGy.U8DwrascW6kCAd7.MG4-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Mobile\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "These goofy-looking earbuds are actually real-time in-ear translators", "title_full": "These goofy-looking earbuds are actually real-time in-ear translators", "published": "2017-10-03T20:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/wt2-real-time-earphone-translator-in-use-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 41, "comments": 0, "shares": 41}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 28}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a5667b717f15a4e66415aec3464dfd812980f9e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeGy.U8DwrascW6kCAd7.MG4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lulu Chang", "published": "2017-10-03T20:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "These goofy-looking earbuds are actually real-time in-ear translators", "text": "Home > Emerging Tech > These goofy-looking earbuds are actually real-time\u2026 These goofy-looking earbuds are actually real-time in-ear translators Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Travelers and others seeking to overcome a language barrier may welcome a translation device that does just that. \nBreaking down those communication barriers may be a much quicker process than previously anticipated if Timekettle\u2019s WT2 prove to be everything we hope they are. These earbuds aren\u2019t meant for playing music or podcasts, but rather for communicating with people who speak a foreign language. Because not being a polyglot shouldn\u2019t stop you from having a conversation with just about anyone in the world. \nRather than talking past one another in your respective languages, the WT2 claims to allow for real-time translation . That means that you can speak face-to-face with your fellow human, and immediately decipher his or her message without the need for a mediator. Promising natural, hands-free communication, the WT2 seeks to enable conversations in two different languages via two earphone translators and one app. Simply don one of the earphones, speak in your language, and your interlocutor will hear in theirs. \nUsing the WT2 looks to be pretty simple. Simply pull them out of their charging case when you\u2019re meeting with someone who doesn\u2019t speak the same language, and give one to your new friend. The earbuds will automatically pair with an iOS app, and begin listening for your communication. If you\u2019re speaking in Spanish to an English speaker, your friend will hear your Spanish words in their native tongue after a short delay. And when your friend replies in English, you\u2019ll hear said response in Spanish. \nThis simple and straightforward approach to real-time translation allows for more natural interactions. You\u2019ll still be able to maintain eye contact, gesture, and use other non-verbal cues, all while understanding one another in your respective languages. \nThe device is actually said to work quite well. While there is a latency issue (which could make for some awkward staring), it seems as though the actual translation portion is functional. Be warned, however, that you\u2019ll need a strong Wi-Fi connection for the WT2 to work. So if you\u2019re climbing K2 and need to communicate with your sherpa, you might be out of luck. \nCurrently, the WT2 supports six languages: Mandarin Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish; but more are said to be on the way. You can pre-order a WT2 now for $149, and expect shipment in January 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "timekettle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:38:30.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d45778bca67ea005d69445fac8dfb7400829ca0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBfonDkzjCvQm7aLjgR6_5dfgKwYN1Kmzj73geqNlK71kQpWWsgs7MjSS3l1sK4a0wlgCqnigfWhk-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Mobile\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Astell & Kern AK70 Mk II hands-on review", "title_full": "Astell & Kern AK70 Mk II hands-on review", "published": "2017-10-03T19:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/astell-kern-ak70mk2-review-in-hand-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 55, "comments": 0, "shares": 55}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d45778bca67ea005d69445fac8dfb7400829ca0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBfonDkzjCvQm7aLjgR6_5dfgKwYN1Kmzj73geqNlK71kQpWWsgs7MjSS3l1sK4a0wlgCqnigfWhk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andy Boxall", "published": "2017-10-03T19:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Astell & Kern AK70 Mk II hands-on review", "text": "Samsung Yepp YP-55V \nOtherwise, the buttons are all easy to reach, and it\u2019s obvious what they do. We\u2019re less likely to constantly interact with the AK70 Mk II than we are a phone, so the minor interface sluggishness will be just that \u2014 minor. Vocal superiority \nWe only had a small selection of demo tracks to try after plugging in our headphones \u2014 for our demo, we used our trusty pair of B&O Play H2 on-ears \u2014 but there was enough variety to give us a strong impression. It\u2019s instantly obvious just how much the AK70 Mk II loves to sing. Vocal tracks soar and beguile, demonstrating the AK70 Mk II\u2019s rich tuning. Rebecca Pidgeon\u2019s Spanish Harlem was utterly involving, and wonderfully intimate. \nDoubling the DAC chipsets means double the audio pleasure. \nThe strummed bass line never overpowered the singer\u2019s sweet voice, and it made us smile all the way through \u2014 which ultimately, is what quality sound should do. It\u2019s very easy to fall for the AK70 Mk II when it facilitates these emotions. This isn\u2019t to say non-vocal tracks suffer. Duke Ellington\u2019s In A Mellow Tone was detailed and lively, while the stereo separation at the start of David Bowie\u2019s Starman was precise and fun. \nListening to music on a device dedicated to doing so is an eye-opening experience. Smartphones can sound great \u2014 the LG G6 and LG V30 spring to mind \u2014 but can\u2019t deliver the same power, versatility, or musical energy as the AK70 Mk II. It plays most major file types, from MP3 to FLAC, and in 24bit/192KHz resolution, while DSD files will be converted to PCM. The player offers 64GB of storage, with 256GB more available via an SD slot. Upgraded circuitry means improved signal-to-noise ratio, crosstalk, and reduced jitter over the AK70 Mk 1. Onboard Wi-Fi lets you connect to streaming music services, and the good news is the player has AptX HD support through the Bluetooth connection. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends \nThe AK70 Mk II also has a larger battery than the original, though Astell & Kern tells us this mostly gets eaten up by the second DAC chipset, making the upgrade a wash. Battery playback is estimated between 6-8 hours per charge. In addition to the regular 3.5mm headphone jack, a more powerful 2.5mm balanced output \u2014 almost doubling the Mk I player\u2019s 2.3Vrms output to 4.0Vrms \u2014 is alongside it, ready to drive more capable, demanding headphones. We didn\u2019t get the chance to try this out in our quick demo. Finally, we like the way the AK70 Mk II can be plugged into your computer to act as a dedicated headphone DAC, letting you enjoy improved sound quality at home too. \nDoubling the technology hasn\u2019t given Astell & Kern reason to double the price. The AK70 Mk II is $700, up $100 from the AK70 Mk 1 , which although pricey when your smartphone will play at least some of the music files with moderate results, is excellent value when you consider this is the first A&K music player to include dual-DACs below the $1,000 price point. \nWhether it\u2019s worth that level of financial investment will come down to your love of music and depth of wallet. However, as storage space and battery life on smartphones becomes more of a concern, and availability of high quality music becomes greater, owning a dedicated music player is making more sense every day. We\u2019d recommend testing the versatile, great sounding, and eye-catchingly styled Astell & Kern AK70 Mk II if this predicament sounds familiar.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:38:31.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b685096be179b4a3a2863da901d127c97cc36986", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXDk4vOq8wMr3.e94gtKEkRhe7f94IpN5SnCtpiSmuTUqA--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Mobile\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Which Verizon plan is best for you?

If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll need to add these amounts back in to get your price before taxes and fees. \nYou\u2019ll pay $20 per person plus the amount of your data package and the cost of any phones you buy on Verizon\u2019s installment plans. Only the cost of talk, text, and data are listed in the chart above \u2014 we\u2019ll get into phone payments in a later section. \nYou can share a plan between up to 10 smartphones and devices. Tablet lines cost $20 to connect, hotspot lines cost $10 (for 600kbps speeds on Go Unlimited and 15GB of 4G LTE speeds on Beyond Unlimited), and wearables cost $5 to connect. \nUnlimited Go and Unlimited Beyond \nWith everyone going to unlimited data, Verizon\u2019s plans, while attractive, are on the expensive side. They\u2019re also a little constrictive. \nStarting August 2017 , Verizon instituted a cap on all new and existing unlimited plan customers. On the carrier\u2019s $85-a-month Beyond Unlimited plan, videos streamed over the network are automatically throttled to 720p resolution (1,280 x 720 pixels) on phones and 1080p (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) on tablets and mobile hotspot devices. It\u2019s technically a bandwidth limit: Verizon says the maximum speed for video applications tops out at 10Mbps. \nVerizon\u2019s cheaper, $75-per-month unlimited plan has even more strings attached. On it, videos are down-scaled to \u201cDVD-quality streaming\u201d 480p (640 x 480 pixels) resolution on smartphones and 720p resolution on tablets. \nAnd there\u2019s a hard usage cap on Verizon\u2019s unlimited plan data plans. If you exceed 22GB in a billing cycle, you\u2019re subject to having your download speeds reduced until the end of the month. \nThe bottom line with Verizon is that it isn\u2019t perfect. But if you need reliable service just about anywhere, Verizon\u2019s premium to Sprint and T-Mobile might be worth it. In some areas, Verizon is one of the only carriers with decent service (if any), so in some cases you might not have much of a choice. \nRecommendations: Stay away from the 2GB plan unless you\u2019re sure you won\u2019t use much data. App-heavy users will exceed this allotment quite easily. Families should really consider the 8GB or Unlimited plans, with our preference being the Beyond Unlimited plan. \nThe perks of the Verizon Plan : Strong service in rural areas A big phone selection \nThe downsides of the Verizon Plan : Verizon charges overages when you exceed your data limit, unless you have data limit or overage protection, which costs $5 a month A hard cap and down-scaled video on all unlimited data plans Pricier plans than T-Mobile or Sprint International service costs more Verizon\u2019s prepaid plan \nVerizon also offers a prepaid plan for those of you who want to save some money. Its prepaid plans are a bit pricier than the competition, but if you want Verizon service, they tend to be a bit cheaper. \nVerizon\u2019s multi-line option, Prepaid Family Account, lets you add up to four lines to a single account. Subscribers get a discount on each additional line (up to $20 a line) and have control each line\u2019s data allotment. \nSo how does it work? If you buy four Verizon prepaid lines at 10GB per line, you\u2019ll pay $60 for the first line and $20 less for each subsequent line (up to a maximum of five lines). The total price for four lines, then, is $180 a month without a contract. \nHere\u2019s a chart that better explains it: People", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "verizon", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "t-mobile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sprint international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sprint", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:38:32.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da9281ae84745751e5508bd1512f7e7d23d97e77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBqxphyEqQLpAO_8wa8xc9fAcjt8FAMY5x82udmCFyBdo7UTXQFZXJJ1iFMiMZqgbAtMxiwTATTxhB05aeSn3.Bg--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Cars\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Turn your ride into a Google Street View with the Insta360 Pro", "title_full": "Turn your ride into a Google Street View with the Insta360 Pro", "published": "2017-10-03T21:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/insta360-pro-3-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg?ver=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 9, "comments": 0, "shares": 9}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 6}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da9281ae84745751e5508bd1512f7e7d23d97e77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBqxphyEqQLpAO_8wa8xc9fAcjt8FAMY5x82udmCFyBdo7UTXQFZXJJ1iFMiMZqgbAtMxiwTATTxhB05aeSn3.Bg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hillary Grigonis", "published": "2017-10-03T21:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Turn your ride into a Google Street View with the Insta360 Pro", "text": "Home > Photography > Turn your ride into a Google Street View with the\u2026 Turn your ride into a Google Street View with the Insta360 Pro Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you want to shoot Street View photos from your car, the Insta360 Pro is the first available camera to earn Google's approval for car-mounted shots. \nEver want to drive one of those camera-clad Google Street View cars ? Well, now you can make your own ride a Street View car. This week, the Insta360 Pro camera became the first available Street View Ready camera that\u2019s compatible with a top-of-the-car mount. \nGoogle\u2019s Street View Ready designation is designed to help consumers find a camera compatible with the Street View platform. While other cameras have earned the designations, the Insta360 Pro is the first that earns the recommendation for the auto category, or the kind designed for shooting as Google does with a camera mounted on top of a car. Cameras from Sphericam, Z Cam and NCTech Ltd. are also in the process of earning the designation for the auto category, but have not yet launched. \nFor shooting Street View via car, Google says, the camera needs to be able to capture images at high speeds, which means shooting at least five frames per second. That feature is being added to the camera through a firmware update. Additional qualifications include an accelerometer and GPS to help Google map out the location where the images were shot \u2014 Insta360 is adding GPS to the Pro with an accessory to meet the qualifications. \nThe Insta360 Pro fits the bill for those still photo requirements along with boasting 8K video at 30 fps or 4K at 100 fps. A built-in stabilization system should also help the camera perform while car-mounted. \nDesign-wise, the Insta360 might make your ride look almost as odd as the Street View Cars. The spherical, basketball-sized camera uses six lenses. \nBesides earning Google\u2019s stamp of approval, the Street View Ready classification also means that the Street View app can control the camera. As with other Street View cameras, Google also has a few to loan out for organizations and even individuals that can\u2019t cough up the $3,500 list price for the camera. \nWhile the Insta360 Pro is the first to earn the classification for a car-mounted camera, a number of other 360 cameras have already earned the certification for different applications, including mobile, virtual reality, and a category for software and multi-camera systems.

Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Electric technology is advancing so fast that a zero-emissions hot hatch could soon go from concept to reality. \nThe all-electric Nissan Leaf isn\u2019t the model that typically comes to mind when the conversation turns to hot hatches. That could change later this month, however, when a new concept named Nissan Leaf Nismo breaks cover at the biennial Tokyo Auto Show. \nThe Nismo stands out from the garden-variety Leaf with a much sportier design; it\u2019s like an electric car in track shoes. It receives a concept-specific body kit with red accents, a deeper front bumper that mimics air dams without incorporating them because they\u2019re not needed, and a black stripe on the hood that matches the roof panel. Walk to the back of the car and you\u2019ll find a roof-mounted spoiler, plus an air diffuser integrated into the rear bumper. Multi-spoke alloy wheels add a finishing touch to the design. \nThe visual upgrades continue inside, where Nissan has added sport seats for the front passengers, a flat-bottom steering wheel with a 12 o\u2019clock mark, and more red accents for good measure. \nIt\u2019s not all about looks, though; Nissan promises the Leaf Nismo is \u201ctruly exciting to drive.\u201d The list of handling-enhancing modifications includes a sport-tuned suspension which lowers the ride height, high-performance tires, and a re-programmed ECU that helps the electric motor deliver instant acceleration at all speeds. More specific performance details haven\u2019t been published, so we don\u2019t know what else Nissan has up its sleeve, or what effect the body kit has on range. \nThe brand-new second-generation Leaf uses an electric motor rated at 147 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque. Those are generous increases of 40 horses and 49 pound-feet over the outgoing model, but there is still room for improvement \u2014 especially since the Leaf gained 100 pounds in its transition from a first- to a second-generation model. A car the size and weight of the Leaf would need at least 250 horsepower to be considered a true hot hatch. Let\u2019s hope Nissan\u2019s Nismo team hasn\u2019t forgotten about that aspect of building a sports car.

That\u2019s about to change. \nGM will launch 20 new all-electric models by 2023, CEO Mary Barra announced yesterday. That includes two new models that will appear in the next 18 months, and will be \u201cbased off learnings from the Chevrolet Bolt EV ,\u201d according to a GM press release. \nThe initiative will put GM well ahead of rival Ford when it comes to electric cars. Ford announced its own electrification effort earlier this year, but it focuses primarily on hybrids, with just one all-electric model confirmed for the future. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) continues to largely ignore all-electric cars, with CEO Sergio Marchionne continually harping on how the company loses money on its sole all-electric model, the Fiat 500e. \nBut overall, announcements of large fleets of new electric cars and hybrids are becoming common in the auto industry. \nBy the end of the decade, both Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover plan to sell only mild hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and battery-electric cars. Mercedes-Benz says it will offer a hybrid or all-electric version of virtually everything it makes by 2022. BMW will launch new 12 all-electric models by 2025. The Volkswagen Group wants to offer an all-electric or hybrid version of every model in its sprawling lineup, which spans everything the main VW brand to Bugatti and Lamborghini, by 2030. \nThe majority of the new GM vehicles will almost certainly be battery-electric cars like the Bolt EV, but GM isn\u2019t ruling out hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. Meeting customers\u2019 needs while reducing emissions will require a \u201ctwo-pronged approach\u201d encompassing both batteries and fuel cells, the company said. GM has been testing fuel-cell vehicles for years, has a partnership with Honda to further their development, and even built a prototype fuel-cell pickup truck for the Army. \nA large number of electric cars (and maybe fuel-cell cars) will likely be required to meet stricter emissions standards. Even with the current administration\u2019s focus on reducing regulations, automakers will likely have to prepare for tougher emissions targets in the U.S. Meanwhile, China, the world\u2019s largest car market, plans to institute sales quotas for electric cars and plug-in hybrids in 2019.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T22:04:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5bffd197d6b9c048d6d2b5b8cda3889a830fa9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeMGkui2DTCL1.5s.9GuRF7bek_pglxhZ6g--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://heresalink.com/rss", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "(no title)", "title": "Scientists just encoded \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSmoke on the Water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 onto a strand of DNA", "title_full": "Scientists just encoded \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSmoke on the Water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 onto a strand of DNA", "published": "2017-10-03T22:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/deep-purple-dna-data-storage-twist-bioscience-final-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 112, "comments": 4, "shares": 112}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 32}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5bffd197d6b9c048d6d2b5b8cda3889a830fa9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeMGkui2DTCL1.5s.9GuRF7bek_pglxhZ6g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T22:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scientists just encoded \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSmoke on the Water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 onto a strand of DNA", "text": "Home > Emerging Tech > Scientists just encoded \u2018Smoke on the\u2026 Scientists just encoded \u2018Smoke on the Water\u2019 onto a strand of DNA Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Successful demo highlights how the very fabric of life itself may be our best available storage option. \nRemember when the original iPod wowed us with its claims of letting you carry around 100 songs in your pocket? Well, U.S. biotech company Twist Bioscience , working in conjunction with Microsoft Research and the University of Washington, has just gone several orders of magnitude smaller \u2014 by encoding music tracks onto individual strands of DNA . The songs chosen for the remarkable demonstration include \u201cTutu\u201d by Miles Davis, and a jazz cover of \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d by Deep Purple. \n\u201cThis is the first time DNA has been used as a long-term archival-quality storage medium,\u201d Angela Bitting, a spokesperson for Twist Bioscience, told Digital Trends. \u201cThis is an incredible proof-of-concept project that demonstrates what could happen in a commercial setting, as the price of DNA writing comes down. In addition, it\u2019s a large project \u2014 140MB encoded for just two songs \u2014 [which] are very large files compared to encoding done in the past.\u201d \nTwist isn\u2019t the only organization doing interesting things with the storage capabilities of DNA. Earlier this year, researchers at Harvard University successfully demonstrated how E. coli bacteria can be modified to store images and movies in its DNA . The idea may sound crazy at first but, as Bitting notes, it could well turn out to be the future of storage . Each cell in the human body contains approximately three billion base pairs of DNA. With 75 trillion cells per person, that\u2019s the equivalent of 150 zettabytes of information within each body. \n\u201cThere are many real-world applications of the technology,\u201d she noted. \u201cWe believe the initial commercial applications would be things like medical records for hospitals, financial records for banks and financial institutions, records for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that need to keep a lot of regulatory and clinical documentation, intelligence and defense information, media and entertainment companies, libraries and museums and many others.\u201d \nIn addition to the small physical size needed for storage centers, DNA can also last a whole lot longer than storage types such as magnetic tape, which audio masters are frequently kept on. \u201cThe next steps for this research are to focus on ways to reduce the cost of DNA synthesis specifically for DNA digital data storage to make this a viable commercial opportunity,\u201d Bitting said.

Blizzard told Digital Trends that Overwatch Halloween Terror 2017 will run through November 2, giving players more than three weeks to enjoy the festivities. The nights grow cold \n&mdash; Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) October 3, 2017 \nThe return of the spooky event surfaced as a rumor on Reddit a few days ago after a promotional balance card image detailing the event\u2019s now-confirmed start date was shared. \nWe don\u2019t know all of what\u2019s up for grabs or what the event will entail this year, but judging by the teaser featuring Dr. Junkenstein, we expect the player-versus-environment (PvE) cooperative game mode called Junkenstein\u2019s Revenge to rejoin the fray throughout the event window. It\u2019s unclear if the venue will still be the Adlersbrunn map, or if Blizzard has plans to switch it up. \nWe also see McCree and Reaper squaring off in some new guises. McCree\u2019s skin looks ripped from Van Helsing, while the Reaper is notably without the pumpkin head he had during last year\u2019s Halloween event, where 12 heroes had new skins on the line. Halloween-themed emotes, sprays, and victory poses were also up for grabs during the inaugural event. Last year\u2019s loot boxes were also replaced with jack-o\u2019-lanterns filled with candy throughout the event. \nFollowing the initial reveal, several other new skins leaked out, compiled by Reddit user Mnemosynaut . These include Zenyatta as Cthulhu, Symmetra as a demon, and Mei as a jiangshi (a vampire from Chinese folklore, perhaps familiar to gamers through Hsien-Ko in the Darkstalkers 2D fighting franchise). It also included another look at Reaper\u2019s vampire/Phantom of the Opera get-up. \nOverwatch has received six seasonal events since it launched in May 2016. Halloween Terror 2017 joins the Summer Games as the only event to occur twice thus far. If the Summer Games were any indication, the second year of Halloween Terror could feature more content than the first. During Summer Games year two , all of the skins available last year were available, along with seven new skins. \nAlong with our hopes for both old skins and new skins, we\u2019re interested t0 see if a standard map will be decorated with Halloween fixtures. Last year, the Hollywood map had a lavish makeover to celebrate the event. \nHopefully, everyone who is excited to take part in the event will be able to. Blizzard recently clamped down on the growing toxicity problem among its player base, handing out bans for those who violate the terms of service. Sadly, as these things sometimes go, innocent players found themselves banned inadvertently from competitive play. Blizzard reportedly identified the bug and has been working to reinstate wrongfully banned players. \nUpdate: Added information to reflect Halloween Terror is now live.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "junkenstein", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "van helsing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccree", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "digital trends", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:46:39.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "436dd70db0db7372892719803be5a6931c530e06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBTgmo8Y5p_1N67LOkbK87V9rB72rX7TJEPN0raZQd5Ush0be4VVzxs4HgOHNRFvra", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "All users can grab firmware update 5.0 for the PlayStation 4 right now", "title_full": "All users can grab firmware update 5.0 for the PlayStation 4 right now", "published": "2017-10-03T17:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/sony-playstation-4-pro-0010-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg?ver=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 6}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "436dd70db0db7372892719803be5a6931c530e06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBTgmo8Y5p_1N67LOkbK87V9rB72rX7TJEPN0raZQd5Ush0be4VVzxs4HgOHNRFvra", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brad Jones", "published": "2017-10-03T17:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "All users can grab firmware update 5.0 for the PlayStation 4 right now", "text": "Home > Gaming > All users can grab firmware update 5.0 for the\u2026 All users can grab firmware update 5.0 for the PlayStation 4 right now Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you While Update 5.0 might not bring about any huge changes to the PlayStation 4, it is packed with smart tweaks that will improve the user experience. \nAfter more than a month of availability to beta program users , Sony have released PlayStation 4 firmware 5.0 to all users. Code-named Nobunaga, this patch introduces a host of tweaks and new features, including smart improvements to the Quick Menu and the system\u2019s media viewing capabilities. \nThe update allows users to disable pop-up notifications while the console is playing a movie or a television show, eliminating any potential distractions at a crucial moment. There is also a new option to turn off message previews in favor of a generic new message notification, as well as a choice between light and dark color schemes for the actual notification pop-up. \nThe Quick Menu has been outfitted with a couple of helpful additions, like a small system clock readout and the option to leave the current party. The notifications section of the menu now gives an at-a-glance readout of download progress and party invites, too. \nThe Friends List is also being adjusted, with the Favorite Groups tab being replaced by Custom Lists, allowing players to give themselves easy access to players they often call upon to play specific games. Fireware 5.0 also provides a quick way of exiting several different messaging groups at once and introduces the option to share music via the system\u2019s messaging app. \nThe PlayStation 4\u2019s broadcasting capabilities has received some attention too as 1080p, 60fps Twitch streaming is now supported on the Pro model. Additionally, communities can now be bound to a broadcast, adding a link to the community page from the spectator screen and there is a new option to view spectator comments while broadcasting while wearing a virtual reality helmet . \nSony is also making some big changes to the way master and sub-accounts work, streamlining this functionality under PSN Family. Multiple adult users can be part of the same family and now there is more granular control over what kind of parental controls are set for each member of the family, which is handy if children are at different ages and need to be able to access different content. \nFinally, there is a new tournament bracket viewer and Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Romanian, Thai, and Vietnamese have all been added as system language options. \nTo download the latest PlayStation 4 firmware, just turn on your console and you should receive the update before you\u2019re able to log into PSN. \nUpdate: Revised to reflect that the firmware is now available to all users.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nobunaga", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "custom lists", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:16:01.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "577329b2c7628485c43d4250063b2086063e5435", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzePIBHz.BRVmnytC9GPnbs5EMaCKKjS9oYw--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Emerging Tech\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Smart table figures out what you\u2019re drinking to select the right music", "title_full": "Smart table figures out what you\u2019re drinking to select the right music", "published": "2017-10-04T00:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/dsc_0811-edit-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 40, "comments": 0, "shares": 40}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 5}, "linkedin": {"shares": 24}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "577329b2c7628485c43d4250063b2086063e5435", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzePIBHz.BRVmnytC9GPnbs5EMaCKKjS9oYw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Luke Dormehl", "published": "2017-10-04T00:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Smart table figures out what you\u2019re drinking to select the right music", "text": "Home > Emerging Tech > The \u2018Classyfier\u2019 table figures out what\u2026 The \u2018Classyfier\u2019 table figures out what you\u2019re drinking, plays appropriate music   Why it matters to you Classyfier smart table is a fun demo of how machine learning can be used to improve the ambience in your home. \nThanks to the Internet of Things , breakthroughs in machine learning , and the plethora of cheap sensors that are readily available, virtually every \u201cdumb\u201d piece of household furniture now has a smart counterpart. The latest example of this? A table created by researchers at Denmark\u2019s Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design that is able to detect what beverages people are drinking around it and select the appropriate mood music. \n\u201cHave you been in situations where the mood dropped because someone took forever to decide which music to play?\u201d Kelvyn Marte , one of the three designers (along with Benedict Hubener and Stephanie Lee ) who created the table, told Digital Trends. \u201cThe Classyfier is a table that automatically chooses music to fits the current situation. It does that by picking up the characteristic sounds of beverages consumed around it, [such as] the clinking of wine glasses or the sound of opening a can of beer. It basically takes the role of the designated DJ so that people can focus on other things. We found it exciting to use sound as an input because it opened up a lot of new interactions that could be either very intentional or completely seamless to your normal behavior.\u201d \nIn terms of hardware, the table boasts a built-in microphone which picks up sounds. These sounds are then compared to a catalog of pre-trained examples.

Unfortunately, \u201cporch pirates\u201d are common enough that over 15 million people have a delivery stolen from their home each year, according to Package Guard . To protect deliveries when they arrive, the company has created a new product that serves to deter thieves. After a successful Kickstarter campaign, which raised over $45,000 from 381 backers, the Package Guard is now available for pre-order on its website. \nPackage Guard is a small alarm, about the size of a Frisbee , that can be placed outside your front door . The device clearly says, \u201cPlace Package Here,\u201d so that those delivering items know where to set the packages. Once a delivery has been set on the device, Package Guard\u2019s alarm is armed. If anyone tries to remove the package without entering the necessary passcode in the app, an alarm will sound, much like a car alarm. \nFor those who have home security cameras, Package Guard can be set to work in conjunction with the system. In this case, the alarm will also take a photograph of the person who snatched the package. The image can then be automatically shared with the police or on Facebook to warn neighbors. \nThe idea behind Package Guard comes from founder Michael Grabham, who was himself once the victim of a porch pirate. He had been expecting a delivery of coats to be distributed to the homeless over the holiday season, but the package was stolen from his front porch. \n\u201cWith an increasing number of people ordering items delivered to their homes, I wanted to create a simple solution that would solve the problem of protecting a delivery when no one is home,\u201d said Package Guard founder Michael Grabham in a press release. \nYou can now pre-order the Package Guard and keep your deliveries safe for $69. This represents $20 off the retail price of $89, so if you\u2019re interested in ensuring that your packages stay on your porch (and out of the hands of strangers), this may be a good investment to make. \nUpdate: The Package Guard is now available for pre-order on the company website.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael grabham", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "package guard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:37:57.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b9d0222c382c7268a87d361f8ccf4095214ea97c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeJzmF7hGqdsb.PFZ1aypUS5JshMKPlZ0tw--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Emerging Tech\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Go ahead, be a crybaby!

There\u2019s now a way to harvest energy from human tears Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you This discovery could turn out to be invaluable for the development of future biomedical devices, such as pacemakers. \nFrom solar power to hydroelectricity to evaporation , there are plenty of sustainable energy sources out there that are worth exploring. One that we have not personally come across before? Human tears. That\u2019s the basis for new research from scientists at the Bernal Institute at the University of Limerick in Ireland, who have found that a protein present in our tears \u2014 as well as saliva, milk, and bird egg whites \u2014 can be used to generate electricity when pressed. \n\u201cIn our research, we were looking at the property of piezoelectricity in a protein called lysozyme,\u201d Aimee Stapleton, one of the researchers on the project, told Digital Trends. \u201cPiezoelectricity is a property of some materials, whereby if you squeeze them, an electric charge, or electricity, is generated. We know a lot about how piezoelectricity works in standard piezoelectric materials like quartz, but know a less about how it works in biological materials. From the study of traditional piezoelectric materials, we know that having a certain type of crystal structure is important and we were interested to see if the same was true for proteins. So, we grew crystals of lysozyme and found that if we apply pressure to them they produce an electric charge.\u201d \nStapleton said that the team is currently looking for real-world applications for this research. One as-of-yet unexplored avenue might involve finding some specific use case for lysozyme\u2019s unique antibacterial and electricity-producing properties. For example, it may be useful as an energy harvester to support the functionality of biomedical devices such as pacemakers; especially since traditional piezoelectrics are often toxic \u2014 as is the case with lead. \nAnother possible use would involve the creation of a device able to control the release of drugs in the body by using lysozyme as a physiologically mediated pump which works by scavenging energy from its surroundings. Personally, we just like the idea of being able to squeeze out a few tears to recharge a smartphone which has died at an inopportune time!

It\u2019s bigger all around, more refined, and more expensive, but a high-end Model 3 falls in the same price bracket as a lightly used Model S. Tesla is well aware of this, so company boss Elon Musk has been trying to anti-sell the car in order to steer buyers toward a Model S. \nIf you\u2019re not sure whether to get a Tesla Model 3 or a Model S, read on to find out how they\u2019re alike and how they\u2019re different. Tech features \nTech is one of Tesla\u2019s most important selling points, and neither model disappoints. Both cars can be configured with the brand\u2019s Autopilot suite of electronic driving aids. It keeps the car in its lane, automatically changes lanes, navigates freeway on- and off-ramps, and even parks the car on its own. It\u2019s available as an extra-cost option on the 3 and the S. The Tesla sedans also benefit from an over-the-air software updating system, navigation, and keyless entry, among other features. Performance and range \nThe most basic version of the rear-wheel drive Model 3 (the one which corresponds to the often-advertised $35,000 base price) offers 220 miles of range from a 50-kilowatt-hour battery pack. It performs the benchmark 0-to-60-mph sprint in 5.6 seconds, and it goes up to a top speed of 130 mph if you give it enough tarmac. Don\u2019t look for horsepower and torque figures; Tesla won\u2019t release them for the time being. The company argues range is a much more important statistic. \nYou can get a 70-kWh battery pack and quicker charging if you\u2019ve got an extra $9,000 in your pocket. Range goes up to a more usable 310-mile range, though the 3\u2019s base price also goes up to true luxury car territory \u2013 and within a stone\u2019s throw of a used Model S . The bigger battery pack reduces the 3\u2019s 0-to-60-mph time to 5.1 seconds. \nPerformance and range for the Model S is all over the board. The most basic model is called 75D. Its 75-kWh battery pack provides 259 miles of range, and it helps propel the car from 0 to 60 mph in a brisk 4.2 seconds. Top speed is reached at 140 mph, though it\u2019s a figure very few owners will ever see. \nTesla Model S P100D \nThe next model up in the Model S hierarchy is called 100D. Built around a 100-kWh battery pack, it sees its range bumped up to 335 miles and its top speed bumped to 155 mph. It\u2019s a tenth of a second quicker to 60 mph. Finally, the P100D is a high-performance version of the 100D. Range goes down to 315 miles, but it posts a jaw-dropping 0-to-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds. That\u2019s about on par with the Bugatti Chiron , and it can fit the entire family plus gear. \nProduction of the all-wheel drive Model 3 hasn\u2019t started yet, so it\u2019s rear-wheel drive-only for the time being. Every Model S is equipped with Tesla\u2019s dual-motor all-wheel drive. \nAll Tesla owners can take advantage of the company\u2019s ever-growing network of Supercharger stations. Filling up the battery is free for Model S (and Model X ) owners, but Model 3 owners will need to pay every time they plug in. Rates haven\u2019t been announced yet. Interior and exterior design \nThe Model 3 takes interior design to the next level. Its most striking visual aspect is the dashboard , which is dominated by a horizontal screen you\u2019d expect to find in the television aisle at Best Buy. It replaces nearly every single button, switch, and gauge normally scattered across the cockpit. It\u2019s a unique solution that makes the Model 3 considerably easier to build. It\u2019s worth noting every part of the 3\u2019s interior was designed in-house by Tesla. \nThe Model S is futuristic, but it looks a lot more conventional inside than its smaller sibling. For starters, components like the massive vertical touch screen, the instrument cluster, and the air vents are exactly where you expect them to be. But since the Model S was Tesla\u2019s first mass-produced car, the company sourced components from other manufacturers when possible. You\u2019ll immediately recognize the switchgear if you\u2019ve ever driven a late-model Mercedes-Benz. \nTesla thankfully avoided the Russian doll approach to design its German rivals are stuck in. Its sedans share a handful of defining styling cues, like a grille-less front end and a fastback-like roof line, but one isn\u2019t a Xerox copy of the other. \nThe Model S is unquestionably the better option if you routinely haul around people or gear. It offers space for five adults plus two jump seats suitable for small children, and up to 30 cubic feet of trunk space. Note the jump seats and the trunk space are mutually exclusive. The most you\u2019ll fit in the Model 3 are five adults and 15 cubes of your stuff. Pricing and availability \nThe base Tesla Model 3 starts at $35,000 before incentives, which sounds attractive until you look precisely up how to get your hands on one. Waiting times are excruciatingly long. Tesla estimates customers who recently placed an order likely won\u2019t get their car until halfway through next year at the earliest. \nThe cheapest Model S currently available on the Tesla website is a 60-kWh model priced at $45,000. The company\u2019s inventory of used cars includes every variant of the S released over the past couple of years, and the selection changes on a regular basis. All of them come with free Supercharging, and they\u2019re available right now. You could be driving one a week from today. \nIf you\u2019re looking to shop new, the cheapest Model S is the all-wheel drive 75D, which starts at $74,500. The midrange 100D is priced at $99,000, while the P100D flagship \u2014 which is one of the quickest cars on the planet \u2014 carries a base price of $135,000. Customers should expect to wait between 30 and 60 days before receiving a new, custom-ordered Model S.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "model s. tesla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elon musk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "digital trends", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xerox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bugatti chiron", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:18:48.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cf48414c16517d40d6cf7e231124c744438c318", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8AhemjJmgJw3.zM_Dwe9_x2Xy7kj4OWfRKzZSL1jv5MrCjyISpN0SNKxqQT1T7zMCqTgTALQ7MTb0LA--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in iOS 11 | Digital Trends", "title_full": "How to turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in iOS 11 | Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-03T22:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.18, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/ios-11-review-control-center-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 17, "comments": 0, "shares": 17}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cf48414c16517d40d6cf7e231124c744438c318", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8AhemjJmgJw3.zM_Dwe9_x2Xy7kj4OWfRKzZSL1jv5MrCjyISpN0SNKxqQT1T7zMCqTgTALQ7MTb0LA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tyler Lacoma", "published": "2017-10-03T22:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in iOS 11 | Digital Trends", "text": "Home > How-To > How to turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in iOS 11 How to turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in iOS 11 The Control Center in iOS 11 doesn\u2019t completely turn off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: \nWi-Fi and Bluetooth settings have a little problem in iOS 11 : You can\u2019t use the Control Center to turn them off anymore. You can try, but when you pull up that shortcut menu and tap on the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth icon, it will no longer shut those features off . Instead it will only disconnect from any current devices or networks. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals will remain active, even when Control Center says they are turned off, and less obvious wireless transfers can still occur. \nApple\u2019s goal appears to be service-motivated. If Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections always stay on, they can still automatically connect to Apple services like AirDrop, AirPlay , Apple Watches, and so on. That gives Apple easier ways to collect more information on product use/location, and it also keeps up background processes or connections that you may not have noticed, so nothing important (syncing, backups, etc.) is disrupted. \nHowever, the deal isn\u2019t so great for users. The always-on connectivity takes up a bit more battery life, especially if you are near other Apple devices; it allows for constant tracking when people may prefer privacy, and leaves the iOS more open to hacking via Bluetooth . If this is too much for you, you can scale back iOS 11 to a previous iteration . But if you want to keep the update, there are still a few ways you can fully turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in iOS 11. Let\u2019s walk through them. Option 1: Use Airplane Mode \nBring up the Control Center, and you will notice that one of the icons beside the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi buttons is an airplane: That\u2019s the popular Airplane Mode , known to most of us as an effective way to shut down all connections to save battery life when boarding flights or traveling out of service areas. It\u2019s designed to be a handy shortcut, and it still works. \nTo test this option, swipe up on the screen to bring up the Control Center and tap the Airplane Mode icon. It should turn red, and your other connection icons should turn off. When Airplane Mode is activated, these connections really are off, and will not connect even for background Apple services. When you turn Airplane Mode off again, your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections will still remain off . You can activate them again by tapping on the icons. \nSince Airplane Mode is right there on your Control Center, this is a very easy alternative for turning off both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi at off, especially since you don\u2019t need to leave Airplane Mode on for this to work. However, since it\u2019s a device-wide shutdown of all connections, it may not work well for more delicate control, especially if you depend on a data connection to get things done. Option 2: Go into Settings and turn them off manually \nThe new iOS 11 limitation appears to only affect the Control Center. Head over to iOS settings and take a look at the top three options: Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Select any of these, and you will see a small toggle to turn them on or off immediately. \nIf you were already using Settings to turn off your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, congratulations! You don\u2019t have to change anything. If not, consider this a way to have more choices now that Control Center isn\u2019t as reliable. There will probably be times where you want to disconnect from Bluetooth devices around you (such as Bluetooth speakers when you are privately trying to listen to music), but you will want your Wi-Fi connection active. Airplane mode won\u2019t help you here, but going into Settings will allow you to turn only one off. Likewise, you may sometimes want to shut down Wi-Fi for security purposes while maintaining a Bluetooth connection to your Apple Watch or other devices.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bixby", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple watches", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "control center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:27:22.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31a2065530b2d5846e1dbe1ac3a8ba8fe9e491b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8AhecqCdLL1gtuza1Sw5Ay1nwBC2rGnBCcDEDVeLLW38zT84uxH6HAdY8Alt9Q_NZFekDQUbI9L9mYLBZse4tV3yE", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Beyerdynamic\u2019s Aventho headphones use audiology tech for tailor-made sound", "title_full": "Beyerdynamic\u2019s Aventho headphones use audiology tech for tailor-made sound", "published": "2017-10-03T21:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.157, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/beyerdynamic-aventho-2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 0, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31a2065530b2d5846e1dbe1ac3a8ba8fe9e491b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8AhecqCdLL1gtuza1Sw5Ay1nwBC2rGnBCcDEDVeLLW38zT84uxH6HAdY8Alt9Q_NZFekDQUbI9L9mYLBZse4tV3yE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Parker Hall", "published": "2017-10-03T21:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Beyerdynamic\u2019s Aventho headphones use audiology tech for tailor-made sound", "text": "Home > Home Theater > Beyerdynamic\u2019s Aventho headphones use\u2026 Beyerdynamic\u2019s Aventho headphones use audiology tech for tailor-made sound   Why it matters to you Beyerdynamic's Aventho wireless headphones map your personal hearing, creating a perfectly tailored sound signature just for you. \nAs headphone technology continues to advance in terms of wireless capability and sheer audio quality, more and more headphone companies are turning to advanced audiology research to learn not just how to most accurately reproduce and transmit sounds, but to investigate the individual way that each human perceives audio. As it turns out, the way people hear is extremely varied. With its newly announced Aventho wireless headphones, Beyerdynamic partnered with Mimi Hearing Technologies to provide tailor-made listening profiles for each person, aiming to create a perfect audio experience for everyone. \nThe new headphones use a special app called Make It Yours to test each listener\u2019s hearing profile over six minutes, using Mimi\u2019s sound customization technology to change the playback settings of the headphones so that the overall sound profile perfectly suits your ears. \nThe headphones are an elegant and businesslike blend of metal, black plastic, and leather that offer hours of battery life and touch controls. In addition to custom sound signatures, they pair with an app called Sound Watching, which provides listeners with analysis about playback volume and listening duration \u2014 helping determine potential long-term issues with hearing strain before they develop. \nApart from advanced technology and playback analysis, the company\u2019s new on-ear headphones will likely offer the same excellent sound we have heard in the Beyerdynamic\u2019s other high-end models . The headphones feature aptX HD for high-quality wireless playback and use the AAC codec on iOS. \n\u201cThe Aventho Wireless is truly a custom headphone,\u201d Beyerdynamic\u2019s Director of the Americas Alan Feckanin said in a press release. \u201cOur market in the USA has been asking for this. We are thrilled to have a superior product that responds to our customers\u2019 wants and needs. Beyerdynamic continues to provide exceptional quality products for the USA consumer.\u201d \nAventho are not the first headphones we have seen that use advanced tech to offer personalized sound. Companies like Nura have been working on similar products, with headphones like the Nuraphone also adapting audio playback to each listener\u2019s individual ears via a 60 second automatic process. \nThe headphones are currently available for order on Beyerdynamic\u2019s website , where they retail for $530.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "beyerdynamic", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alan feckanin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nuraphone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mimi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mimi hearing technologies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:43:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "185cea93ba81db05dad48bb7367ebc31808ec5b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8AhfX3072lHyA.XLo3Mkej5PRvUqcmg7fN1XyPCW0GofCZvT8oGbfo_cAArEkELj.AjUm3i2u0QZy6WfKBceqI4PX", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Prolitec Reinvents Ambient Scenting for the Retail and Home Market | Digital Trends", "title_full": "Prolitec Reinvents Ambient Scenting for the Retail and Home Market | Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-03T21:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.215, "main_image": "https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/aera-scent-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "185cea93ba81db05dad48bb7367ebc31808ec5b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8AhfX3072lHyA.XLo3Mkej5PRvUqcmg7fN1XyPCW0GofCZvT8oGbfo_cAArEkELj.AjUm3i2u0QZy6WfKBceqI4PX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Clayton Moore", "published": "2017-10-03T21:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Prolitec Reinvents Ambient Scenting for the Retail and Home Market | Digital Trends", "text": "Google Home review Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: \nIn 1960, a Swiss \u201cosmologist\u201d named Hans Laube teamed up with movie producer Mike Todd Jr. for a bizarre marketing scheme dubbed \u201cSmell-O-Vision,\u201d in which more than 30 scents were pumped into theaters during the lone screenings of the Z movie Scent of Mystery . \nTo say that Smell-O-Vision did not work out would be an understatement of colossal proportions. \nThe smells were released with a distracting hissing sound, and audience members in the balcony received the scents out of sequence from the events in the film. Because the scents were relatively subtle, audience members would sniff loudly to try to catch the smell. These bugs were mostly corrected after a few showings, but poor word of mouth and negative reviews of the film signaled the death of Smell-O-Vision . \nBugs were mostly corrected after a few showings, but poor word of mouth and negative reviews signaled the death of Smell-O-Vision \nDespite the crash and burn of Scent of Mystery , Smell-O-Vision as an actual marketing technique is still far more prevalent than consumers might think. Don\u2019t believe us? Why did your hotel just finish baking cookies the last time you checked in? Did your hotel room smell of lavender? What about that clothing store at the mall with hip young people \u2014does the scent emanating from that particular place remind you of anything? It\u2019s all part of a multi-million-dollar industry called ambient scenting , and one of the industry\u2019s giants is about to turn heads with its new IoT-powered scenting platform. \nProlitec is an ambient scenting company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They have executive offices in Seattle and a worldwide sales presence on top of it all. Their new innovation is called ScenXus , and it aims to combine a highly sophisticated scenting technology with a smart IoT platform to monitor and control the performance quality of commercial scenting devices. The system is the big brother to the company\u2019s Aera line of products, which integrates scenting into in much the same way as devices like Sonos, Nest and other IoT devices interact within a smart home. \nWhile the new commercial technology is developing, where Prolitec\u2019s bread is buttered is in the home market, where their Aera line of home scenting products is one of the most popular products in the Internet of Things (IoT) market. The pricing is different for each system, however, in that ScenXus clients pay a monthly subscription fee based on the complexity and individuality of their service, while Aera users simply purchase scenting cartridges based on their individual tastes. \nAera is a system meant to complement existing IoT technology like Google Home or Alexa , according to Prolitec CEO Richard Weening. The Aera devices are already controllable with smart devices like Alexaand will eventually be connectible with all home IoT devices. \n\u201cThe story of ScenXus has to be the story of ambient scenting.\u201d \n\u201cFrom a home point of view, you have control of the temperature with Nest said. \u201cWhat it is at its most basic is the use of scent in commercial settings for some marketing-related reason. The reasons range from making a place smell better to associating a particular scent with a brand, selling a product, or any other situation where scent can add value to the customer experience.\u201d \nIt may sound strange, but Weening says that smell can be one of the most powerful factors that influences customers. \n\u201cScent is a very powerful reminder of memory,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more powerful than sound. It\u2019s processed in the limbic region of the brain where emotion is processed. All of us humans prefer spaces that smell better to places that smell bad. It\u2019s simple, and it\u2019s not really weird science. It\u2019s just common sense.\u201d \nHere\u2019s how it works: Prolitec takes a liquid fragrance\u2014which can be made up of as many as 20 different ingredients\u2014and convert it into very tiny droplets. How tiny? A droplet of liquid in, say, aerosol deodorant is about 50 microns wide, or about one-millionth of a meter. Prolitec takes that same amount and distributes its fragrance as 150,000 droplets. This allows the company to release all the ingredients at once. \nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that this technology is perfectly safe. Prolitec is required to meet all OSHA health and safety requirements as well as many other laws on the books. \n\u201cWe\u2019re safety nutcases because we think it\u2019s an important issue and we want to be the leader in that aspect,\u201d Weening said. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible\u2014it\u2019s not even very hard\u2014to be safe.\u201d \nUp until recently, retail employees monitored the scenting of their stores. That led to problems because of a phenomenon known as \u201colfactory adaptation,\u201d which basically means that if you\u2019re constantly exposed to a smell, you can\u2019t recognize it anymore. Staff would say they couldn\u2019t smell the scent, so Prolitec would turn up the volume. \nCustomers who came in the store would then complain the smell was too strong. \nThat\u2019s where Prolitec\u2019s new ScenXus control platform comes in. By integrating the delivery system as an IoT platform, the company can control the amount of scent from its research center in Milwaukee without ever having to send out a technician to adjust the system or the amount of scent. \nThe company also can eradicate bad smells. Prolitec has a proprietary technology that works along the lines of a pair of noise-canceling headphones, only for scent. \nWeening thinks it will be interesting to see how the commercial market develops compared to the enormous success of Aera. \n\u201cThe home market is huge, but the commercial market is an emerging market. No one knows how big it is yet. It\u2019s growing very fast, but it\u2019s still smaller than the consumer market so far.\u201d \nFor an industry that continues to evolve and get more sophisticated, Weening says the new technology is a game changer. \n\u201cScent is just another design element for retail and other commercial environments,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can pick your graphics and your font and everything else, but the scent is the most impactful thing in the store. We always start out with a trial, but then customers always want to go further, because they invariably like it.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "weening", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike todd jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prolitec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hans laube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexaand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard weening", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "osha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google home", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "milwaukee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:27:38.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e211838ffebf352ddafd3cbcb2533d0a6b279b3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXCRPer76JlgQiTzAaMUQrZNbhaIT0BYqP...6e9p6OOTPUO9rbLNzGznCHFBg4XyAXz8fy6v4WR_g--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Revolcam mixes light and lens in a $29 five-in-one smartphone photo accessory", "title_full": "Revolcam mixes light and lens in a $29 five-in-one smartphone photo accessory", "published": "2017-10-03T22:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.216, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/revolcam_2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e211838ffebf352ddafd3cbcb2533d0a6b279b3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXCRPer76JlgQiTzAaMUQrZNbhaIT0BYqP...6e9p6OOTPUO9rbLNzGznCHFBg4XyAXz8fy6v4WR_g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hillary Grigonis", "published": "2017-10-03T22:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Revolcam mixes light and lens in a $29 five-in-one smartphone photo accessory", "text": "Home > Mobile > Revolcam mixes light and lens in a $29 five-in-one\u2026 Revolcam mixes light and lens in a $29 five-in-one smartphone photo accessory Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The Revolcam may not be available outside of Kickstarter yet, but it offers more than just the typical smartphone lens combo. \nSmartphone camera accessories aren\u2019t hard to find \u2014 but a new product is claiming to reinvent smartphone photography by integrating not just swappable lenses, but a light and a selfie mirror, too. RevolCam , a smartphone accessory with a universal fit, became a fully funded Kickstarter project in less than five hours and now has nearly 10 times the original funding goal. \nRevolCam comes from the same company behind the ShiftCam , an iPhone 7 camera case designed to make lens swaps easy. The RevolCam keeps the idea of simple lens swaps intact, but expands on the concept even further, joining the ranks of multi-function accessories like the Smoovie MiniRig , with a light, mirror, and a non-specific fit for use with both Apple and Android smartphones, laptops, and even the built-in web cam on a laptop. \nA trio of lenses sit on RevolCam\u2019s clip-style design. These lenses rotate to swap the different options over the smartphone\u2019s built-in lenses, offering a macro (20x magnification), fish-eye (160-degree view) and wide-angle lens (110-degree view) in one product. \nAt the top of the rotating lens trio, RevolCam uses a detachable LED light. Mounted on the device, the LED works like an on-camera flash, but expands the possibilities with brightness that can be adjusted just by twisting the light. The LED offers 230 different brightness levels and is powered by batteries that can be recharged through a Micro USB port. \nSince the light is both continuous and battery-powered, the designer opted to allow the light to slide off the mount system for off-camera lighting as well. When the light is removed, a selfie mirror sits in its place, allowing selfie-snappers to use the higher resolution rear-facing camera while still having some idea of what\u2019s actually being shot. \nDespite the five-in-one feature list, the RevolCam measures at less than three inches at the largest point and weighs about 1.6 ounces. \nNow a fully funded campaign, developer ShiftCam , based in Hong Kong, expects to begin shipping the RevolCam in November \u2014 though the product will undergo final testing and quality control this month. If the final development is successful, backers can pick up the RevolCam for pledges starting at $29 .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kickstarter", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:27:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e62d5bbc1963667508d9da81a33731e7369dc54d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBEQpaTqM9dIGqAaYVQmneZ.DRSAhlDo9I", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Report hints at who knew what and when in Waymo/Uber lawsuit | Digital Trends", "title_full": "Report hints at who knew what and when in Waymo/Uber lawsuit | Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-03T21:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.998, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/dtd10032017-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e62d5bbc1963667508d9da81a33731e7369dc54d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBEQpaTqM9dIGqAaYVQmneZ.DRSAhlDo9I", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bill Roberson", "published": "2017-10-03T21:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Report hints at who knew what and when in Waymo/Uber lawsuit | Digital Trends", "text": "Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: \nOld sweatshirts, bowling balls, Waymo data drives\u2026 \nThe Uber vs. Waymo self-driving car tech secrets case is heating up. Reports made public yesterday reveal that the central character in the case, engineer Anthony Levandowski, had direct communication with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick \u2013 who is currently not CEO \u2013 and both knew there were possibly some secrets from Google\u2019s Waymo project literally in Levandowski\u2019s closet. \nAccording to a report prepared by cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg as part of Uber\u2019s acquisition of self-driving trucking startup Otto, Levandowski came across some data disks in his home shortly after he left Google\u2019s self-driving car project. He let Kalanick know, and the CEO said he wanted nothing to do with the disks, and to \u201cdo what he needed to do,\u201d as in, get rid of them. Levandowski says he took the disks to a shredder, but records of that are\u2026 vague. \nThe report also details a long list of text messages amongst key figures in the case, computer forensics probes that turned up odd findings, key communications with HR and so on, but so far, there seems to be no smoking gun that Uber intentionally ported Google\u2019s tech to their own self-driving car and truck projects. But, the billion-dollar-plus lawsuit is far from over, so stay tuned and check out all the latest updates. \nRemember \u201cEVs?\u201d We just call them \u201ccars\u201d now \nMore car news now. In case you thought this electric car thing was just a passing fad, GM would like you to know it thinks otherwise. According to CEO Mary Barra, two more new EV models will be joining the Chevy Bolt in the next two years, and by 2023 \u2013 just about five years from now \u2013 Barra says GM will have 20 electric cars in their lineup . Also in the mix: vehicles that run on electricity generated from hydrogen-powered fuel cells. \nWhy fuel cells? Cars the run on hydrogen fuel cells are essentially zero-emission, just like pure electric cars, except you can gas \u2018em up just like a gas powered car. The only byproduct from the process is pure water. GM and Honda have been working on fuel cell cars for years now, and California is constantly expanding their hydrogen filling station infrastructure, so it could be a bridge of sorts to an all-electric future but with the convenience of gas, as it were. \nGM isn\u2019t alone in their vision of an electric car lineup: Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover, BMW, Volkswagen and many Japanese carmakers are all saying the future of driving is electric, so you might want to rethink those long-term oil stock investment plans. \nSiri, is there anything good on? \nHey, we\u2019ve got our hands on the new Apple TV 4K streaming box, and DT A/V editor Caleb Denison has been putting it to the test in the luxurious home theater room here at DT HQ. \nBest new feature: definitely Siri integration for searching for your favorite shows, along with the 4K resolution update, of course. The new Apple TV also features \u201chigh dynamic range\u201d or HDR support for improved picture quality, and the interface is lightning quick. Nit picks?

According to one reported rumor, the search giant is planning to introduce a new hardware solution called its \"Advanced Protection Program.\" \nHaving good personal security is a major part of keeping yourself safe online. Having a strong password is part of it, but two-factor authentication is considered far safer than a passcode alone. Bloomberg's report though , suggests that Google may have developed something even safer: hardware 'keys.' \nThe system makes use of twin USB devices termed security keys . These would act as their own secondary identifying marker, thereby only letting you log into your Gmail account or equivalent by inserting them into the system you wanted to use. Reportedly you'd need to use both to log in, effectively making it three-factor authentication. \nThe big advantage of a system like this rather than using your phone is that they are far less conspicuous. Although smartphones have their own security, hackers targeting a high-profile individual would know to go after their smartphone -- a device that features remote access -- in order to steal their identity. It's much harder to gain access to a physical device which has no wireless connectivity. \nAnother big part of the new Advanced Protection Program is that it prevents any third-party applications from accessing your data. Although that's quite an extreme measure, it's designed to cater to politicians and executives who should value security over ease of use for sensitive data. One cited example in Bloomberg's report is the hack of the Democratic National Committee emails in 2016, which could potentially have been prevented with improved security from some of those who had access to them. \nIt's not clear as of yet if Google will offer this new security system to everyone, or if it will simply market it privately to business heads and politicians. If it proves popular, however, it wouldn't be a surprise to see this sort of service appear for other providers in the future. \nWhatever it ends up becoming, Google's new Advanced Protection Program is expected to debut within the next month. \nIn the meantime, if you need help improving your security, consider a password manager .

After all, those multitools have been around for more than 120 years and have achieved legendary status due to their utilitarian design and function. But a new product called the Firefly recently launched on Kickstarter and it delivers a handy new feature that many hikers and backpackers are going to want to add to their knives. \nThe Firefly comes our way courtesy of Tortoise Gear , a company best known for its Solar water bags that can purify water using only heat from the sun. But while those products are focused on keeping hikers hydrated on the trail, the Firefly is designed to help achieve another basic need \u2013 fire. \nMade from a custom sparking material developed by Tortoise Gear, the Firefly is a fire-starting tool that has had a lot of thought put into its design. For starters, it was specifically made to integrate nicely with many Swiss army knives by sliding into the slot that typically holds the toothpick. Yep, that\u2019s right, quite a few of these knives include a toothpick amongst their menagerie of onboard tools, but since virtually no one actually uses the toothpick with any regularity, few outdoor enthusiasts would miss it if it went away. Thanks to its design, however, the Firefly can occupy the same space currently used to carry the toothpick, bringing much more useful functionality along with it. \nTypically a fire starter of this kind is made from a blend of steel and ferrocerium, an alloy created specifically to generate sparks. But the designers behind the Firefly say they came up with their own material that has several advantages over traditional starters. For instance, it is reportedly twice as easy to ignite a flame using the Firefly, which can set tinder and other fuels ablaze from the sparks created by quickly running a sharp edge along its length. The material used to create the Firefly is also said to be stronger and more durable than a regular fire starter, which not only helps it to spark easier but prevents it from breaking in the backcountry too. \nTortoise Gear is hoping to raise $28,000 to get the Firefly into production, and just a few days into the crowdfunding campaign, it is already well on its way to reaching that goal. That means the product should go into production within a few months and begin shipping in January. At that time, it will be available in two sizes \u2013 regular and mini \u2013 and priced at $14 for a three-pack.

You\u2019re in luck \u2014 that is, if you happen to have an LG Watch Sport . On Monday, Octobeer 2, Google announced a beta program for Android Wear that brings a few of the features of Android 8.0 Oreo , the newest version of Android, to wearable devices. \nIt\u2019s an extension of the Android beta program, Google says. \u201cThe Android Beta Program gives you an opportunity to try out prerelease versions of Android and Android Wear, and provide feedback. The feedback you provide on the beta will help us identify and fix issues, and make the platforms even better.\u201d \nSinging up isn\u2019t terribly difficult, but you\u2019ll have to enroll manually by heading to the Android beta web page and signing in with your Google account. Assuming you\u2019ve set up your LG Watch Sport and paired it to your smartphone, it will show up beneath the page\u2019s Your eligible devices subheader. Click the Enroll device button next to the picture of your Watch Sport, and you\u2019re golden \u2014 in the next few hours, you\u2019ll get an over-the-air update to the latest beta of Android O for Android Wear. Alternatively, you can kick off the update manually by heading to the Watch Sport\u2019s Settings menu and tapping System > About > System Updates. \nBe aware, though, that it is preproduction software. You\u2019re likely to encounter bugs and instability. \nSo what\u2019s new? One of most visible new features is Notification Channels, which offers fine-grain control over the alerts, messages, and replies that buzz your wrist. In apps that tap into Android 8.0 Oreo\u2019s notifications framework (like Clock, Play Music, and the Play Store), you\u2019ll see toggles for categories like \u201cNew follower\u201d and \u201cLikes\u201d that can be switched off at will. During the 2017 I/O Developer conference earlier this year, Google gave the example of an airline app: You might want to block airfare promotions, for instance, while letting upcoming flight reminders go through. \nThe Android Wear beta\u2019s other big feature is background limits, which is a bit tougher to quantify. Google describes it as \u201cincreased restrictions on [\u2026] services\u201d like location updates and background tasks, which should translate to better battery life. \nThe update\u2019s other changes are on the minor side. In the Settings app, there\u2019s a new screen that shows how much of the watch\u2019s internal storage each installed app is using. A new Apps & Notifications screen consolidates app info, notifications, and permissions menus in one menu. And a new vibration adjuster lets you switch between a normal, long, and double pattern. \nGoogle says the Watch Sport beta will be the only one before Android 8.0 Oreo for Android Wear\u2019s final production release.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lg watch sport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watch sport", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:27:51.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2fda14ae83397693977f146173a4e8a28fe7c14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz7tjfNWJW4r3EYfh3WMqXWbX_5iWmq3o4kdb_ypotyzrqaX0H06l.3hqKFJC6Ij4ETIsv6UbUggEQ--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Windows Mixed Reality details new Samsung headset, pre-orders go live", "title_full": "Windows Mixed Reality details new Samsung headset, pre-orders go live", "published": "2017-10-03T22:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.249, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/windows-mixed-reality-headset-samsung-hmd-odyssey-10-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 11, "comments": 0, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e2fda14ae83397693977f146173a4e8a28fe7c14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz7tjfNWJW4r3EYfh3WMqXWbX_5iWmq3o4kdb_ypotyzrqaX0H06l.3hqKFJC6Ij4ETIsv6UbUggEQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mark Coppock", "published": "2017-10-03T22:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Windows Mixed Reality details new Samsung headset, pre-orders go live", "text": "Home > Computing > Windows Mixed Reality details new Samsung headset\u2026 Windows Mixed Reality details new Samsung headset, pre-orders go live   Why it matters to you Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality vision will be realized soon and here is everything that you need to know to be ready to place your order. \nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows Mixed Reality vision is nearing its debut on October 17 as the final software bits will be released with the upcoming Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and a few headsets will start shipping.

The Odyssey will provide the same relatively standardized set of specifications and capabilities as the lineup of headsets that\u2019s already been announced, and it will be available with motion controllers for the slightly higher than usual price of $500.

I want to understand him.\u2019 And I really believe Jared can do it. He\u2019s one of the great actors of today.\u201d \nThis will be the second time around for Ratner and the biopic. The veteran director and producer was previously attached to a Hefner biopic with the blessing of the Playboy founder himself. Robert Downey Jr. was expected to play the lead role. That project eventually stalled out and was later picked up by another studio that planned to have The Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin at the helm. The project changed hands again later on, with Ratner regaining the rights to the film for his production company, RatPac Entertainment. \nRatner is also planning to develop a reboot of Playboy After Dark , the television talk show that Hefner hosted in the 1960s. \nBorn in April 1926, Hefner founded Playboy magazine in 1953 and served as the editor-in-chief of the publication and the chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, the multimedia organization he built around the Playboy brand. He built a reputation as a dedicated bon vivant who was often accompanied by multiple \u201cgirlfriends\u201d anywhere he went, and seen wearing expensive silk pajamas and smoking a pipe. He celebrated that lifestyle through the various elements of the Playboy empire, and was known to be an outspoken advocate of sexual liberation and freedom of expression. \nHefner died September 27, 2017, at age 91 . \nThere\u2019s no official timeline for the Hefner biopic at this point, but Ratner has indicated that he plans to \u201cdo the motion picture as an event.\u201d Leto, who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club , will next appear in Blade Runner 2049 , which hits theaters Friday, October 6.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jared leto", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jared", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "hugh hefner", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "hugh", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "leto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david dobkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert downey jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hef", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brett ratner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ratner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hefner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "playboy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "playboy enterprises", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood reporter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas buyers club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ratpac entertainment", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:27:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8508f8d5c1683a79d2b76b17abcba1de3b4b9c90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBTgmo8Y5p_1PRpM0f.2y9CwpKtrNr_WQuJPBq8ws1LUkD33L6rI8w6LbF.WbntAM_8KCV9fTHPOA-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "\u2018Halo: Recruit\u2019 brings the universe to Windows Mixed Reality this month", "title_full": "\u2018Halo: Recruit\u2019 brings the universe to Windows Mixed Reality this month", "published": "2017-10-03T22:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.011, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/master-chief-halo-5-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg?ver=2", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8508f8d5c1683a79d2b76b17abcba1de3b4b9c90", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBTgmo8Y5p_1PRpM0f.2y9CwpKtrNr_WQuJPBq8ws1LUkD33L6rI8w6LbF.WbntAM_8KCV9fTHPOA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gabe Gurwin", "published": "2017-10-03T22:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "\u2018Halo: Recruit\u2019 brings the universe to Windows Mixed Reality this month", "text": "Home > Gaming > \u2018Halo: Recruit\u2019 brings the universe to\u2026 \u2018Halo: Recruit\u2019 brings the universe to Windows Mixed Reality this month Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you We're excited to see the Halo universe expand, and mixed reality looks like the perfect place to start. \nThe Halo series was already confirmed for Microsoft\u2019s Windows Mixed Reality platform, but the alien-fighting science-fiction blockbuster is arriving sooner than we expected. On October 17, fans will be able to experience Halo in mixed reality in a short experience titled Halo: Recruit. \nAvailable for free on October 17 and available to try in Microsoft stores, Halo: Recruit is a bite-sized experience featuring \u201cseveral iconic characters,\u201d according to a statement given to Engadget by Windows Mixed Reality head Alex Kipman. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a fun, brief introduction into the world of Halo,\u201d Kipman said. \nAs it\u2019s a free title, we don\u2019t expect too much from Halo: Recruit , but it should, at the very least, help show the potential for the series in a virtual reality or mixed reality environment. \nOther titles already announced for Windows Mixed Reality include Ark Park , a spinoff of the smash-hit survival game Ark: Survival Evolved . Schell Games\u2019 I Expect You To Die , previously released on Vive, Rift, and PlayStation VR, will also support the platform, as will media platforms like Hulu. \nThe announcement comes just a few days after Halo 3 celebrated its 10th anniversary . The acclaimed shooter was praised for its \u201cdefinitive\u201d conclusion to Master Chief\u2019s story (that didn\u2019t last long) as well its excellent online multiplayer component, but up until this point, the Xbox 360 version of the game wasn\u2019t available through backward compatibility on Xbox One \u2014 users had to purchase Halo: The Master Chief Collection instead. That has since changed, with Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary and Halo 4 also available. As Halo 2 was never released on Xbox 360, it isn\u2019t compatible yet. \nWhat wasn\u2019t announced was a remastered Halo 3 like Microsoft had published for the first two games. Following online infrastructure problems rendering much of The Master Chief Collection unplayable at launch in 2014, Microsoft may have decided to allocate its resources elsewhere. The last main entry in the series was 2015\u2019s Halo 5: Guardians , which released to relatively positive reviews, but fell short of the universal praise the original trilogy had received.

Comprising mostly multi-stage boss fights, the game\u2019s trial-and-error gameplay forces you to learn from your past mistakes if you want to make it further into the game, and it\u2019s one of the hardest games we played this generation. But what appears to be an insurmountable task can be made much more manageable if you learn the fundamentals of the game and make use of a few strategies. Our Cuphead guide has the tips and tricks you need to set you on the road to mastering the game. Take time to master the controls \nCuphead is inspired heavily by classic Mickey Mouse cartoons, which featured slightly more emotive movements than we see in cartoons or video games today. This means that he has more of a light and loopy feel when jumping than you see in the Mario games , and it can take some time to adjust to this when you are fighting an enormous boss or jumping from obstacle to obstacle. Instead, take your time on the first few stages. Learn the rhythm of the bosses, but more importantly, note just how far and high Cuphead can jump, and how his dash can be used to avoid obstacles. Fire his standard weapon, and see how long it takes to defeat a small enemy. \nWhat might be even more important than mastering Cuphead\u2019s attacks and dodges, however, is mastering his parry ability. Not only will parrying projectiles (anything pink) help charge up your \u201csuper\u201d abilities, but it will also destroy whatever is parried and cause you to launch into the air. For quickly avoiding larger enemies, this is invaluable, and it\u2019s required for defeating bosses later in the game. If you\u2019re struggling with timing your parries, stay in the tutorial section for a bit and just get the rhythm down \u2014 there is a small window in which it works, and committing it to muscle memory will save you a lot of grief in the long run. Don\u2019t abuse the jump \nWhen spinning fireballs and blades start swirling in your direction, your first instinct is going to be to jump out of their path, but this can often get you into more trouble than it\u2019s worth \u2014 especially against later bosses launching several attacks at once. Instead, see if you can avoid the shots by dashing or even just moving slightly to the right or left. This will leave you prepared for the next attack, and you will be able to keep your weapon trained on the enemy the whole time. \nThe same goes for the parry. In certain enemy attacks, one shot will be highlighted pink, allowing you to destroy it and charge up your super ability more quickly. However note that Cuphead bounces quite high into the air after her parries, which can often cause him to hit a projectile higher up on the screen, so be aware of your surroundings. Choose the right tools for the job \nThe platforming stages in Cuphead each contain five gold coins, which are the currency accepted in the game\u2019s item shop. Once you\u2019ve collected them all in the World 1 stage \u201c Forest Follies ,\u201d head to the shop and purchase the \u201cspread\u201d weapon. Functioning much like the spread-shot gun from the Contra games , it inflicts serious damage on bosses and can take out a rogue enemy before they have a chance to get to you. \nWhile its range isn\u2019t great and you will need to use your standard weapon in certain instances, the spread weapon was our primary choice for the majority of the game. For a few fights, we also found the \u201cchaser\u201d to be effective. Rather than aiming at targets, the weapon zeroes in on them automatically, leaving you free to dodge. Its damage isn\u2019t very high as a result, but in the most hectic fights, it\u2019s a necessity. \nYour extra abilities are just as important as your weapons, if not more so. Early on, you will be able to purchase the \u201csmoke bomb,\u201d which makes you invulnerable to all damage while dashing. When projectiles are coming at you in a small grouping, you will be able to easily avoid them and go back to pummeling enemies. \nAn extra hit point ability is also available, which allows you to take four hits at the cost of slightly decreased weapon damage. In the game\u2019s final few hours, we found ourselves relying on this one regularly, and in the airplane sections \u2014 which don\u2019t allow you to dash at all \u2014 it was particularly useful. Get your super abilities \nIn addition to the various boss and platforming stages you see scattered throughout Cuphead \u2019s three worlds, you also come across stone structures. These are mausoleums, which contain urns that are under attack by an army of pink ghosts. All you have to do to protect the urns is successfully parry each ghost as it approaches. If you\u2019re able to chain your parries together, you won\u2019t have any problem completing all three mausoleums. \nYour reward for defending each urn is a new \u201csuper\u201d ability, which can be unleashed after you have damaged enough enemies to build up its meter. The first of these is a massive horizontal beam attack, which you can use to quickly move a boss to its next phase if an earlier one is giving you trouble. However, it\u2019s almost useless in boss stages set on several small platforms, as the ability pushes Cuphead back and will cause him to fall off the edge. \nFor these bosses, we instead recommend the \u201cinvincibility\u201d ability, which is unlocked after completing the second mausoleum. Its effect only lasts a few seconds, but this is enough time to lay down some serious damage with the spread shot and move Cuphead out of harm\u2019s way. Having invincibility in your back pocket in the final seconds of a boss fight can make the crucial difference. Watch the entire screen \nWhen you\u2019re in one of Cuphead \u2019s \u201cbullet hell\u201d moments, it can be tempting to only focus on his immediate surroundings and the projectiles closing in, but this is a strategy that will leave you frustrated in World 3, as new enemies and attacks will continue to swarm in from different directions. Because of this, you have to keep an eye on the entire screen. Against a scientist and his robot army, electrified walls will appear while you\u2019re dodging his projectile attacks. Against a dragon , small fire imps will shoot up from the ground, and will lead to far more deaths than the dragon himself ever caused. \nTo minimize the hits you take, you don\u2019t actually have to keep your eyes trained on these hazards at all times, but you do have to learn their movement patterns. See an electrified wall barreling toward the bottom of the screen while you\u2019re dodging other projectiles? Start making your way to the top, but keep your attention on the things actually about to hit you. Situational awareness comes with time and paying attention to the games. Your enemies aren\u2019t perfectly predictable, but they do follow recognizable patterns that you can master.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cuphead", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "digital trends", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "cuphead", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:28:08.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "862acedb1c86a8394054ac64ae95d52cd3f3d0ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB4pj_Dz2R6W5RHvxvvwQzMHUV6sKjAZbZvyDHoaGlF9BLrXIM4NHI2LQMFI8IZ145", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Take your glasses to the next level by using AR and Topology Eyewear", "title_full": "Take your glasses to the next level by using AR and Topology Eyewear", "published": "2017-10-03T18:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.624, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/19983344_1225232280915813_1276468035050057429_o-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "862acedb1c86a8394054ac64ae95d52cd3f3d0ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB4pj_Dz2R6W5RHvxvvwQzMHUV6sKjAZbZvyDHoaGlF9BLrXIM4NHI2LQMFI8IZ145", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lulu Chang", "published": "2017-10-03T18:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Take your glasses to the next level by using AR and Topology Eyewear", "text": "Home > Virtual Reality > Take your glasses to the next level by using AR\u2026 Take your glasses to the next level by using AR and Topology Eyewear Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you AR is finding its way into just about every aspect of our lives, and now, that includes our eyewear. \nWho needs a mirror when you have augmented reality ? One day, we may be able to ditch fitting rooms altogether when trying on clothes, but right now, there\u2019s an easier way to try on glasses . Meet Topology Eyewear , an augmented reality app that will actually help you design customized glasses using a 3D scan of your face. \nThink of it as the anti-Warby Parker. Instead of peddling fast fashion that doesn\u2019t offer much by way of personalization, Topology wants to do away with mass manufacturing, and provide glasses that will fit you specifically. After all, not all heads were created the same, so not all glasses will fit the same. To address that, Topology makes use of face-scanning technology to determine how far back your ears are, how symmetrical your face is, how wide your nose may be, and a host of other factor that affect glasses fit. \nTopology says that the whole process is quite seamless and totally painless. Just take a video selfie with your iPhone, and make sure that the footage includes you looking to the front, then left and right. That selfie will be used to \u201censure any frame you choose will automatically fit perfectly,\u201d according to the Topology website. Then, you\u2019ll be able to select your frames \u2014 they\u2019ll either be in Italian acetate or stainless steel, and will come in a range of different colors. Because your frames are built on a 3D version of your head, you can rest assured that they\u2019ll conform quite nicely, without the need for excessive adjustments. \nFinally, you\u2019ll be able to make your own style adjustments. So if you prefer that your glasses sit a little higher or that your frames are a little wider, you can change all that in the app. \nWe should point out that this level of customization comes at a cost. Each pair of glasses begins at $495, and can go as high as $800 if you really want all the bells and whistles. Compare that to the aforementioned Warby Parker, who might not give you the same unique look and feel, but will cost around $400 less (at least). That said, Topology founder Eric Varady said that he believes folks will pay to have glasses that actually fit them. \n\u201cYes, we\u2019re expensive, but really we\u2019re going after the sect in the market that\u2019s already spending that much or more on glasses and lenses combined,\u201d he told TechCrunch . \u201cNo one\u2019s ever had custom before and they fit you incredibly well.\u201d \nSo if you\u2019re looking for a custom pair of frames, Topology may be the place to go.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric varady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warby parker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "meet topology eyewear", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:28:09.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "730ea470d033f744f3bfb9a0a7cc05a2eafbb61a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBTgmo8Y5p_1OOoUo37EoGJolOwyY.RgiDsiPI1J1P6tKkV2u6EHNX4MN34KQtJhMI", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Xbox One Insider members are able to send games as a gift to friends", "title_full": "Xbox One Insider members are able to send games as a gift to friends", "published": "2017-10-03T21:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.088, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/cesc-fabregas-and-sergio-ramos-present-new-xbox-one-in-madrid-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 8, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "730ea470d033f744f3bfb9a0a7cc05a2eafbb61a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBTgmo8Y5p_1OOoUo37EoGJolOwyY.RgiDsiPI1J1P6tKkV2u6EHNX4MN34KQtJhMI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brad Jones", "published": "2017-10-03T21:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Xbox One Insider members are able to send games as a gift to friends", "text": "Home > Gaming > Xbox One Insider members are able to send games as\u2026 Xbox One Insider members are able to send games as a gift to friends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Full gifting support for the Microsoft Store looks set to be rolled out to all Xbox users as of the console's fall update. \nMicrosoft is seemingly preparing to introduce an often-requested feature to the Xbox version of the Microsoft Store as of a future update. Gamers will soon be able to gift content to one another via their Xbox One , based on a preview build that is currently doing the rounds. \nWhile the company is yet to officially announce this feature, members of the Xbox Insider program who are running built 1710 are reporting that gifting functionality is already available, according to a report from Windows Central . As such, we can perhaps expect to see it rolled out to all Xbox One users as of the upcoming fall update. \nOver the course of the Xbox One\u2019s lifespan, we\u2019ve seen Microsoft respond to a bevy of requests from its community regarding new features. It was fan pressure that prompted the much-touted addition of Xbox 360 backward compatibility, and likewise, it was players who pushed for mouse and keyboard support . \nThe option to gift a piece of content is right next to the standard purchase button on a product page in the storefront. It\u2019s possible to deliver the gift straight to the recipient\u2019s Xbox Gamertag, or to their email address. If the latter option is selected, they will receive a 25-digit pre-paid code that can be redeemed to any account. It remains to be seen whether or not this functionality will still be present in the final version of the feature, but it would certainly be handy to have. \nThe only reason it might be removed from the fall update is that the ability to purchase codes lends itself to reselling, which can be a thorny issue for the companies that operate digital storefronts. For years, it was possible to gift games via email or to another user\u2019s inventory via Steam, but Valve retired that functionality in May 2017. \nThe fall update for the Xbox One is set to introduce various new features and improvements, like an overhaul of the system\u2019s user interface, an expansion of its avatar creation tools, and backward compatibility with original Xbox titles. Given that members of the Insider program have been testing the update since August , its official release shouldn\u2019t be too far off.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "valve", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "microsoft store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T02:28:09.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f2da8f62451314eda90f76d43e24bdc370cb9d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz7tjfNWJW4r3E8kv9j9Jqo6w5Ylg0_I5Ci5EW3G87RvEzRiwDU8cbvM", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Computing\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "All 3 billion Yahoo users were compromised in 2013 data breach, the largest ever", "title_full": "All 3 billion Yahoo users were compromised in 2013 data breach, the largest ever", "published": "2017-10-04T01:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/yahoo-offices-headquarters-feat-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg?ver=1", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 184, "comments": 12, "shares": 184}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 13}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f2da8f62451314eda90f76d43e24bdc370cb9d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz7tjfNWJW4r3E8kv9j9Jqo6w5Ylg0_I5Ci5EW3G87RvEzRiwDU8cbvM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jayce Wagner", "published": "2017-10-04T01:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "All 3 billion Yahoo users were compromised in 2013 data breach, the largest ever", "text": "Home > Computing > Yahoo's 2013 data breach is worse than\u2026 Yahoo's 2013 data breach is worse than believed \u2014 3 billion users were affected Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Even if you've never really used your Yahoo account, if you had one at any time before 2013, your personal information was compromised in a 2013 breach. It's time to change those passwords again. \npIn December 2016, Yahoo disclosed that its servers were hacked way back in 2013, compromising the sensitive personal data of around 1 billion users. On Tuesday, Yahoo\u2019s new parent company, Verizon, confirmed that the initial estimate was a bit low \u2014 in fact, all Yahoo accounts were compromised in the 2013 hack. That\u2019s 3 billion users , making it the largest data breach in history. \n\u201cSubsequent to Yahoo\u2019s acquisition by Verizon, and during integration, the company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft,\u201d reads a statement from Verizon subsidiary Oath . \nIf you ever had a Yahoo account prior to 2013, now would be a good time to resecure all of your existing online accounts \u2014 particularly any that may have had contact with your Yahoo account. The security precautions Yahoo took in the aftermath of the original hack might protect current Yahoo users. \n\u201cIn 2016, Yahoo took action to protect all accounts, including directly notifying impacted users identified at the time, requiring password changes, and invalidating unencrypted security questions and answers so that they could not be used to access an account. Yahoo also notified users via a notice on its website,\u201d Oath\u2019s statement says. \nThe original breach shook confidence in Yahoo\u2019s ability to protect its users personal information, not only because of the scope of the data breach but because of how long it took for Yahoo to disclose that its users\u2019 information had been compromised. \nAs a reminder, the original data breach in 2013 potentially exposed names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords, as well as security questions and answers. Naturally, such a glut of personal information could be used in a variety of ways, not least of which would be to access other online accounts. \nYahoo was quick to point out what information wasn\u2019t compromised, however. \n\u201cThe investigation indicates that the information that was stolen did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. Payment card data and bank account information are not stored in the system the company believes was affected,\u201d the statement reads. \nEven though payment data and bank account information wasn\u2019t leaked, it could very well have been accessed with the treasure trove of personal information hackers successfully made off with. So it bears repeating, if you\u2019ve ever had a Yahoo account, it\u2019s time to change all your passwords. Again. \nIf you don\u2019t already have one, now would be a good time to look into a password manager .

Whether performing with supergroups like the Travelling Wilburys, or partnering with a long list of other world-famous musicians for special live performances, Petty had a way of perfectly coalescing with some of the music world\u2019s greatest musical voices. Here are some of the best Tom Petty collaborations of all time, from his iconic studio supergroup to on-stage collaborations with Bob Dylan, Eddie Vedder, and fellow late musical legend Prince. The Travelling Wilburys \u2014 End of the Line \nTom Petty, Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison founded the Travelling Wilburys supergroup in the late 1980s, a collaborating group of iconic musicians that was originally dreamed up by Harrison and Lynne while they were recording Harrison\u2019s Cloud Nine album. On End of the Line, Petty\u2019s musical voice is prominent in the mix, taking the lead vocal on each of the song\u2019s bridge sections while holding down the bassline. Tom Petty and Bob Dylan \u2014 Knocking on Heaven\u2019s Door \nTom Petty joined longtime friend and Travelling Wilburys collaborator Bob Dylan on stage for this special version of Dylan\u2019s Knocking on Heaven\u2019s Door , providing beautiful background vocals and rhythm guitar on the extended live cut. \u201cI though the world of Tom,\u201d said Dylan in a statement to Rolling Stone following Petty\u2019s death, \u201cHe was a great performer, full of the light, a friend, and I\u2019ll never forget him.\u201d Tom Petty, Prince, Steve Winwood, Jeff Lynne and More \u2014 While My Guitar Gently Weeps \nPetty hits the stage with a laundry list of superstars, including Prince and fellow Willbury Jeff Lynne, at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004 for this now-iconic rendition of George Harrison\u2019s While My Guitar Gently Weeps. The performance was part of a posthumous induction ceremony for the late Harrison. Though the live take is best known for Prince\u2019s fiery guitar solo at the end, it\u2019s Petty\u2019s lead vocal that serves as the glue of the song, helping provide the perfect platform for Prince to shred over. Tom Petty & Eddie Vedder \u2014 The Waiting \nGrunge rock pioneer Eddie Vedder joined Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers on stage for this special version of Petty\u2019s early-\u201980s hit The Waiting , lending his gravelly baritone to the pop song. Petty plays 12 string guitar and provides backing vocals on the track, helping to bolster Vedder\u2019s stellar vocal performance. Tom Petty and Stevie Nicks \u2014 Insider \nFleetwood Mac\u2019s Stevie Nicks and Petty\u2019s long string of collaborations began with Petty\u2019s early-\u201980s album Hard Promises , an album that includes hit single Insider , a slow-strumming track that joined both musicians\u2019 beautiful vocal tones in gorgeous harmony. Nicks and Petty would go on to perform this song and many others together throughout the remainder of Petty\u2019s lifetime, with Nicks even going so far as to call Petty her \u201cfavorite rock star\u201d during their final performance together in July 2017.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dylan to vedder", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "george harrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff lynne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vedder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willbury jeff lynne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy orbison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie vedder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve winwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stevie nicks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lynne", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "travelling wilburys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rolling stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "insider  fleetwood mac", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rock and roll hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T04:01:27.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77e5f270f578ec2597da8e0524e0f167b07316ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBqxphyEqQLpAO_8wa8xc9fM9D5iVdv2B1FbCmt6MQu_OCjUDqA36tXGk2N3DszThF", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Cat faces too childish?

On Tuesday, October 3, Snap Inc. launched several virtual Snapchat art installations by artist Jeff Koons, along with an application for other artists to join the platform. \nThe art installations \u2014 leaked when eager viewers set their computer clock ahead on the countdown website \u2014 are now live in nine locations around the world. The Snapchat app directs the user where to go to find the new virtual pieces, then allows visitors to walk around the virtual statue. \n\u201cWe all come about creativity in different ways but the main thing that\u2019s taking place is we\u2019re experiencing play,\u201d Koons said in a statement. \u201cSnapchat is a creative platform and it lets us be able to communicate with each other and transmit ideas.\u201d \nThe artwork, now listed at art.snapchat.com , includes nine virtual sculptures mixing with the real world in Paris, New York City, London, Toronto, Sydney, Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Washington D.C., and Venice, Italy. The statues include larger-than-life balloon animals \u2014 including a dog that\u2019s three stories high in New York\u2019s Central Park and London\u2019s Hyde Park. \nSnapchat is not the first to create virtual artwork discovered in the real world through a smartphone camera. The Bellevue Art Museum in Washington has featured digital graffiti , viewers with the Microsoft Hololens get a different look at the Armory Show , while the Whole Story Project aims to fix the gender skew favoring male sculptures with virtual renditions of historic female figures. Unlike virtual reality applications that allow users to explore art from the comfort of their home , augmented reality places virtual artwork in a real, physical place. \nSnapchat\u2019s art installations were likely a design challenge since a majority of the fixtures are actually designed to look like they are made from real, reflective materials. Koons says that the reflective quality of the artwork is designed to reflect the viewer, making the piece about each viewer. \nSnapchat didn\u2019t release an official comment but simply launched the website after a countdown.

The shuttering of the Starbucks online store brings an end to those days. \nEcommerce may be all the rage everywhere else, but for brick-and-mortar mainstay Starbucks , selling online isn\u2019t as good as selling in stores. On Sunday, the caffeine empire officially shuttered its online store, which means that you can no longer purchase your favorite Starbucks products online or by phone. The change took effect October 1, and spelled the end to your ability to make a pumpkin spice latte at home with Starbucks\u2019 special syrup (yes, you could only buy the brand\u2019s flavored syrups online, and no, Starbucks is not bringing the product to stores \u2014 for now). \nWhile you\u2019ll still be able to by coffee and Starbucks merchandise like mugs and coffee makers, you won\u2019t be able to click a button and have it all delivered to your doorstep. The Seattle-based chain actually first made public its plans to kill its online operations in August, as a way of \u201csimplifying\u201d its sales operations. \nMind you, this doesn\u2019t mean the end of all of Starbucks\u2019 digital offerings. For example, you\u2019ll still be able to buy coffee using the Starbucks app, though you\u2019ll have to pick up that cup of coffee in a physical store. Indeed, the closing down of the online business comes amid an attempt to focus more on the company\u2019s many physical locations. Maggie Jantzen, a company spokeswoman, told the New York Times , \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to invest in amplifying Starbucks as a must-visit destination and are looking across our portfolio to make disciplined, thoughtful decisions.\u201d \nThe decision could spell some inconvenience for Starbucks customers, however. Products that you bought online cannot be returned to physical stores, though you do still have 30 days from your date of purchase to get a refund from Store.Starbucks.com (though all merchandise and drinkware sales are final). Moreover, Starbucks stresses in an FAQ that it \u201ccannot guarantee availability of any product in stores,\u201d though it urges customers to check out their local grocery aisle . \nSo, if you were looking forward to celebrating fall with all your homemade Starbucks lattes, it looks like you\u2019re going to have to settle for going into a store to create that experience.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maggie jantzen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T04:14:49.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d572837f425f68019f50ea44d2eea7ae1abb68aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBlJfEkMyLcfimZFQq.rFoyahs.INqXDVFhL2vrbFPUMNQDpZfqQmVIEXRj5bL8whO.Muxvgj4vllYIjME5uAeFLpwUUllcpQb", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Best Concept Cars Of All Time | List, Pictures, Specs | Digital Trends", "title_full": "The Best Concept Cars Of All Time | List, Pictures, Specs | Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-04T00:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.241, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/chrysler-atlantic-concept-2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 459, "comments": 0, "shares": 459}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d572837f425f68019f50ea44d2eea7ae1abb68aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBlJfEkMyLcfimZFQq.rFoyahs.INqXDVFhL2vrbFPUMNQDpZfqQmVIEXRj5bL8whO.Muxvgj4vllYIjME5uAeFLpwUUllcpQb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ronan Glon", "published": "2017-10-04T00:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Best Concept Cars Of All Time | List, Pictures, Specs | Digital Trends", "text": "These weird cars show what happens when designers ignore the rulebook Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: \nFor decades, the entire automotive industry sat up and listened carefully when a friend or a foe announced a new concept car. They were wild, stylized machines built with a steady eye on the future. Design studies previewed forward-thinking design trends, upcoming tech, or a high-performance engine developed to leave the competition in the dust. \nAutomakers have recently become lazy in that regard, and these days concept cars are often little more than an upcoming production model decked out with cameras in lieu of door mirrors, big wheels, and shaved door handles. It\u2019s unfortunate, but thankfully some brands still know which strings to pull to mesmerize us as we walk the floors of the world\u2019s largest auto shows. Read on to learn more about some of the best concept cars of all time. Volvo Venus Bilo (1933) \nThe 1938 Buick Y-Job is often credited as being the automotive industry\u2019s first-ever concept car. That\u2019s inaccurate; the honor goes to the Volvo Venus Bilo, which was built in 1933 to test the public\u2019s reaction to a more aerodynamic look. Design elements like a full-width body, headlights integrated into the front fenders, and a curved grille helped it stand out from anything else on Swedish roads at the time. The Venus Bilo never reached production, but it influenced the PV36 Carioca launched in 1935. \nYou won\u2019t find it in the company\u2019s official museum . It somehow ended up in the hands of a scrapyard owner in Denmark who converted it into a pickup and used it as a work vehicle. Most historians agree it was destroyed before the end of the 1950s. BMW Turbo (1972) \nBMW\u2019s hometown of Munich, Germany, hosted the 1972 Olympic Games. It was the ideal event to promote the company\u2019s burgeoning lineup of sporty, driver-oriented coupes and sedans. The Turbo was built specifically to turn heads during the summer games. \nWhile it looked like a German Ferrari , this sleek-looking BMW coupe shared quite a few components with the company\u2019s 2002. It rode on a 2002 chassis modified to use a mid-mounted engine, and it received an evolution of the 2002\u2019s four-cylinder. Performance was high enough to worry the Italians across the Alps, but BMW never approved the Turbo for production, and it remained a simple design study. The 1978 M1 put a different, straight-six spin on the idea of a BMW supercar while channeling many of the Turbo\u2019s design cues. Chevrolet AeroVette (1976) \nOdds are you\u2019ve heard the rumors that claim the next-generation Chevrolet Corvette will be mid-engined . They\u2019re most likely accurate, but that\u2019s a different story for a different time. We\u2019re here to talk about how Chevrolet has toyed around with the idea of a mid-engined Corvette several times over the past few decades. \nThe 1973 Corvette 4-Rotor was a highly experimental coupe powered by a mid-mounted, double-rotary Wankel engine. Chevrolet engineers ran into the same issues with rotary technology as numerous other companies: the engine burned a jaw-dropping amount of fuel, and it wasn\u2019t exactly reliable. The car was fitted with a V8 engine and renamed AeroVette in 1976, but the idea of a mid-engined Corvette was dropped altogether before the end of the 1980s. Volvo Tundra (1979) \nBefore Volvo embarked on a design renaissance, it was known for building safe, reliable, and solid cars with a design best described as unadventurous. It tried changing that in 1979 when it asked Italian design house Bertone to draw a shapely family car aimed at a larger target audience. The sketches morphed into the Tundra concept , a two-door sedan with a fastback-like rear end. Volvo decided not to move forward with the project, but the Tundra inspired the Citro\u00ebn BX introduced in 1982. The nameplate laid dormant until Toyota secured it in 1999. Subaru F-624 Estremo (1987) \nThe family sedan of the year 2000 came to life through the Subaru F-624 Estremo concept. Under the outer space-esque design hid a continuously variable transmission (CVT), a four-wheel drive system with front/rear torque split, four-wheel steering, and a rear-view camera. The long, wide engine compartment was home to a twin-turbocharged flat-six engine. The F-624 Estremo didn\u2019t progress beyond the concept stage, but a lot of its tech features trickled down to the Subaru lineup during the 1990s. Chrysler Atlantic (1995) \nThe Chrysler Atlantic took the public by surprise when it broke cover in 1995. At the time, Chrysler was churning out LH platform-based sedans with a cab-forward design, so no one saw the enthusiast-baiting Atlantic coming. It took the form of an elegant, retro-inspired coupe that paid tribute to the Bugatti Atlantique . It used a 360-horsepower V8 engine. It never made it past the concept stage, but it became Chrysler\u2019s halo car for a few years during the 1990s. Bentley Hunaudi\u00e8res (1999) \nWhen the Volkswagen Group purchased Bentley in 1998, executives from both companies made it clear they had big changes in store for the British brand. The Hunaudi\u00e8res concept illustrated one of the directions the company could take. It was a dramatic, low-slung coupe powered by an 8.0-liter 16-cylinder engine tuned to deliver 623 horsepower. \nThe Hunaudi\u00e8res\u2019 never made the jump from the show floor to the showroom floor because it was deemed too extreme. Its exterior design loosely inspired the first-generation Continental GT , and the idea of a W16-powered supercar returned to the Volkswagen Group when Bugatti introduced the Veyron, one of the fastest cars in the world. Lincoln Continental (2002) \nLincoln previewed what could have been a spectacular return to form with the 2002 Continental Concept. With long, flat fenders, a tall belt line, and suicide rear doors, it captured the essence of the 1960s Continental and put a modern twist on it. From a design standpoint, it had nothing to envy Germany\u2019s usual suspects in the luxury sedan segment. The Continental Concept never reached production, and RM Auctions sold it in 2002. \nLincoln introduced another Continental concept in March 2015. This time around, it spawned a production model that resurrected the nameplate after a long hiatus. Volkswagen Golf GTI W12-650 (2007) Ronan Glon/Digital Trends \nThe Volkswagen GTI has used a front-wheel drive, front-engine layout since its inception. The GTI W12-650 concept deviated from that formula by adopting a 650-horsepower W12 engine mounted in the space normally occupied by the rear seats. It was lower, lighter, and much wider than the standard GTI it started life as. Enthusiasts believed it would spawn a production model \u2014 likely an expensive, limited-edition car \u2014 but it remained a one-off. It\u2019s often displayed in Volkswagen\u2019s Zeithaus museum . Honda Urban EV (2017) Ronan Glon/Digital Trends \nHonda\u2019s Urban EV is the newest concept on this list. Introduced just a few weeks ago at the Frankfurt Auto Show, it\u2019s a compact, city-friendly electric car with a retro-inspired design. Honda promises it will spawn a production model in 2019, though whether it will be sold in North America is up in the air. We hope so; we like the idea of a sporty electric car with sharp looks. Of course, we\u2019d like it just as much if it received a Honda motorcycle engine with an 11,000-rpm redline.

And it highlights one of Android\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 fragmentation. Google issues monthly security updates and rolls out version updates to all of its supported Pixel , Nexus , and Android Go devices, but these are not always released in a timely manner by manufacturers and carriers for other devices. \nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind, though, that Google\u2019s survey doesn\u2019t account for the millions of Android smartphones in China, as the search giant only collects data from devices that access the Google Play Store.

If these were $100 or more, these issues could be more damning; at $60, they\u2019re simply concessions that come along with an inexpensive headset. Performance \nWhile the comfort and design are standard for an entry-level headset, the sound quality is, simply put, remarkable on the Astro A10. Astro has included the same drivers found in its $250 A40 and $300 A50 model. That means you\u2019re getting ~$300 sound quality for far less. \nThis headset won\u2019t easily break unless you make a pointed effort. \nThe highs in the mix are clear with a slight punch, perfect for the sound of most games. The low end, while underpowered compared to bigger, more expensive headsets like the Sennheiser GSP 350 , still has enough oomph to give explosions impact. \nWe played a few different titles across multiple platforms while testing. Hearthstone was our mobile pick. The subtle, chilled soundtrack and tavern-like ambience was present and detailed, while the satisfying crash of a defeated opponent felt appropriately powerful. We tested the A10 on the PS4 by playing Persona 5 . The game\u2019s upbeat, infectious funk and jazz soundtrack felt vibrant, and dialogue was clear. Finally, on PC, Quake Champions \u2019 chaotic action, driven by an arsenal of outlandish weapons, was big and powerful. At points, the multiplayer frenzy became slightly muddied when multiple opponents were firing off rockets, chaingun rounds, and beams of lightning, and in those instances we felt the lack of surround sound features which could have helped maintain accurate directionality. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends \nWe found the mic to be clear and consistent in voice capture. However, we wouldn\u2019t recommend these for streaming or podcasting. It\u2019s rare that a headset mic reaches the level of quality a professional streamer would need, and that\u2019s especially true of the A10s. Still, it\u2019ll serve you well for coordinating your payload pushes and point captures, and that\u2019s the important part. \nOverall, we were impressed with the A10\u2019s performance. Sure, the headset lacks many of the features you\u2019d find on the best headsets in the market \u2013 such as 7.1 surround sound that would help maintain directionality in competitive first person shooters like Quake Champions or Overwatch \u2013 but as we\u2019ve said numerous times already, for $60, this is an impressive device. Warranty information \nAstro offers a one-year limited warranty for faulty workmanship and defective parts on all its products, including the A10 headset. Return shipping and labor costs are included. Our Take \nDespite looking and feeling like a sub-$100 gaming headset, the Astro A10 gaming headset has the best sound quality of the entry-level headsets we\u2019ve tested. \nIs there a better alternative? \nThe Astro A10s are not the only decent headset floating near the $50-$60 price point, but we\u2019re struggling to think of any we\u2019ve tested that sound as good. If you want something more comfortable, there\u2019s the SteelSeries Arctis 3, but they cost $20 more. Similarly, the Arctis 3 would also solve the minor design woes and lack of 7.1 on the A10s. \nHow long will it last? \nAs discussed, the A10 is highly durable thanks to the flexible frame, so there\u2019s little risk of it breaking.

Anytime between Monday, October 9, and Thursday, October 12, players are able to download the Gran Turismo Sport beta via the PlayStation Store. By participating in the beta, up to $1 million worth of in-game credit can be carried over into the full game. Any unlocked vehicles are also transferable. \nWithin the beta, fans will have a chance to check out some new features geared toward all levels of drivers, from first-timers to long-standing veterans of the franchise. Racers drive and tune on their own term, while a new matchmaking system keeps players with similar abilities racing against one another. \nFrom the beginning, the beta gives players the option to select which mode they would like to check out. In Sport Mode, drivers first shoot for their fastest lap time during a qualifying session. Depending on the results, similar drivers are grouped together to ensure a highly competitive and fair race. For a more single-player experience, Campaign Mode offers a chance to improve driving skills through challenges, missions, and circuits. Vehicle unlocks, in-game-currency, and experience points act as rewards for completing numerous trials and Daily Workouts. Arcade Mode is included for those who want to jump in and drive. Players choose between a wide range of vehicles on three different circuit configurations with different terrains. \nShowcasing the power of this PlayStation 4 exclusive, Scapes is more than just a traditional photo mode . Each photo location contains all the lighting information needed to insert any personalized vehicle into hundreds of real-world places. Other creative modes include the Livery Editor which allows users to utilize logos as well as change the color of the car, wheels, hood, spoiler, mirrors, and more. \nGran Turismo Sport releases in full on October 17, just one week after the beta. To help warm up the engines, PlayStation Plus members can pre-load the Gran Turismo Sport beta two days early on Saturday, October 7 at 8 a.m. PT. Once the clock strikes 12 a.m. PT on Sunday, October 9, these same players can start racing. For everyone who isn\u2019t a member, download and access to the beta begins at 6 p.m. PT on October 9.

A city council meeting in America is often just an opportunity for the same angry citizens to rant about whatever their hot-button issue is this week. Political operatives know them as \u201cthe squeaky wheel challenge,\u201d while polling professionals talk about the \u201cSTP problem,\u201d otherwise known as the \u201cthe same ten people problem.\u201d \nBut now a startup in Madison, Wisconsin wants to break this dysfunctional cycle of civic engagement by offering a new communication platform that gives citizens a straightforward way to voice their opinions and ideas to elected officials and policy makers. On the flip side, it helps cities, counties, nonprofits and school districts conduct verified policy polling with powerful data visualization tools to help them find the best ways to move forward. \nThe company is called Polco , a shortening of the concept \u201cPolitical Compass.\u201d The platform is the brainchild of two veterans of military and public service who have assembled an A-team of economists, engineers, policy experts and entrepreneurs to bring their concept to the masses. \nAdmittedly, co-founders Alex Pedersen and Nick Mastronardi have extraordinary backgrounds for two guys entering the wild-west world of startups. \n\u201cOne of the bizarre effects is that so much is going on at the federal and state level that it\u2019s almost like people feel like we\u2019re an anchor to something that is tangible and controllable.\u201d \nPrior to starting Polco, Mastronardi was a Senior Economist at Amazon and a member of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers at the White House . That was after he earned his Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin and served as an officer in the U.S. Air Force for more than a decade. Meanwhile, Pedersen spent more than seven years in the Air Force before working as a Strategy and Operations analyst at Google . He earned his Master\u2019s Degree in Public Policy from Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School. These are not typical backgrounds for startup entrepreneurs. \n\u201cWe served , so public policy is important to what we do,\u201d Mastronardi told Digital Trends. \u201cIt\u2019s why we joined the military. It\u2019s a matter of civic duty. We also really love technology based on where we chose to work after leaving the military. When the opportunity presented itself to work at the intersection of the two, we couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d \n\u201cThe whole idea is to help people better navigate the public policies that are on the table and what they actually mean,\u201d Pedersen agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s to help people communicate in a civil way. It\u2019s the whole point.\u201d How Polco Works \nHere\u2019s the deal about Polco: it succeeds in providing real time or aggregated feedback to policy makers from real people in a way that other platforms simply cannot. \n\u201cWe looked at it through a couple of iterations,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cPeople are using Twitter , Facebook , Survey Monkey and Gallup polls , all for roughly the same applications. There are huge trade-offs with all of them. We were trying to find the true intersection between those applications, carve out that space, and make it our own thing.\u201d \nFundamentally, it\u2019s a polling and data analysis platform. When Bryant, Texas officials wanted to know if its citizens would support a fee of $3.18 per month for curbside recycling, they turned to Polco. When Fayetteville, Georgia officials wanted to know what its citizens thought about Starbucks getting a liquor license, they turned to Polco. Where normally a few \u201csqueaky wheels\u201d at a city council meeting would have controlled the conversation, Polco\u2019s operatives discovered the issue had a 90 percent approval rate. \nThe platform is also fluid enough to field lots of different kinds of questions, ranging from pulse questions (standardized, recurring questions to track sentiment over time) to open discussions, yes/no polling, and formal petitions. \nBut here\u2019s where Polco gets interesting. The company registers constituents by mapping them to their own voter registrations . While all data is anonymized during the analyses process, Polco can guarantee that its users are real voters, as opposed to disgruntled people who sign up ten times to take the same poll. Polco voters are allowed to vote exactly once on any given issue, and offer a single comment that isn\u2019t directed at any other user. The platform has literally eliminated the ability to have bitter back-and-forth arguments that characterize other social media platforms. Once the user has voted, they can only see anonymized comments. And then the platform shifts again. \n\u201cLike reddit , they can upvote the strongest arguments for the things that they voted on,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cHow that keeps things civil is that someone new to a question can not only see the official background material, but they can also see the strongest reasons for and against any given issue. We see a lot less trolling and a lot more constructive criticism.\u201d A Local Solution Serving Many Constituencies \nIt\u2019s been an interesting road for the founders of Polco, who started in San Francisco before joining the Seed Sumo accelerator in Bryan, Texas for a bit and then landing at the Madworks accelerator in Madison\u2019s University research park . In its new home in the Midwest, Polco has already won the city\u2019s third annual \u201cPressure Cooker\u201d contest from the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce as well as the \u201cPeople\u2019s Choice\u201d award at the Wisconsin Innovation Awards . \n\u201cSome people are calling the rust belt the new civic engagement belt,\u201d Mastronardi said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be in the heartland. There are very blue areas and very red areas here but everyone is very focused on policy, rather than labels. These cities we work with reflect what our product is designed to do, which is to bring people together to discuss important policy issues facing them and their cities and their state.\u201d \nPolco is already live or ready to launch in 26 municipalities across the nation, and they expect to have approximately 50 commitments by October 1. In addition to an initial seed round of funding of around $900,000, the Polco team recently rolled out a Kickstarter campaign that gained the company a lot of attention during this year\u2019s heated political news cycle. \nWhile the campaign was unsuccessful in raising its $35,000 goal, it did catch the attention of hundreds of backers and nearly $10,000 in pledges. To a degree, it was also a way for the company to measure the interest in Polco and potentially have citizens subsidize or sponsor the platform in their own community. \nA city council meeting in America is often just an opportunity for the same angry citizens to rant about whatever their hot-button issue is this week. \nThe next step in terms of financing is far more ambitious: a Series A venture capital round is kicking off in September with a goal of $1.5 to 2 million. \nThe long-term financial model is sound, both ethically and financially. Polco is always free for individual citizens, while the company charges city governments and other organizations an affordable subscription fee with scalable rates base on city population or other demographic units, starting at around $500 monthly. \nAsked if the controversial political atmosphere in the United States has affected how Polco operates, Mastronardi said, \u201cWell, the environment has been good for business.\u201d \nAlex added that the events happening at the national level are having a profound impact on what happens at the local level. \n\u201cOne of the bizarre effects is that so much is going on at the federal and state levels\u2014and because our focus is primarily local\u2014it\u2019s almost like people feel we\u2019re an anchor to something that is tangible and controllable,\u201d Pedersen said. \n\u201cIn that sense, our focus remains steady, but I think the idea resonates with people even more than before because there are so many unknowns out there right now. When we\u2019re talking about things that affect people a mile away from you instead of in Washington, D.C. , it becomes more attractive to have a voice at the local level.\u201d \n\u201cSome of the smallest towns are really interesting because the issues they\u2019re facing are very different than those in a municipality with 100,000 citizens, or 500,000 citizens,\u201d Mastronardi said. \u201cSomething as simple as putting up a stop sign can be a really contentious issue.\u201d Giving Voice to Everyone in the Community \nAn interesting side effect to developing Polco has been discovering just who it appeals to. Pederson and Mastronardi have crisscrossed the nation educating communities, organizations, school districts and other potential clients. \n\u201cOur platform represents different things to different groups,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cIn terms of flexibility, anyone who can navigate social media can use Polco.\u201d \nThat means for citizens, it\u2019s simply a civic engagement platform\u2014a way to learn what\u2019s going on and have a voice that gets heard. For local governments, it\u2019s a way to collect useful and verified data from most citizens in the community whose sentiments may balance out the vocal few at city council meetings. To tech investors, it\u2019s a unique social media platform and a new way to collect actionable data. Finally, journalists can use the platform\u2019s backend to test whether the data collected by Polco on any given issue is really valid or properly reflects the community demographics. \nWhere the founders almost breeze over their accomplishments is that the Polco platform is portable across mobile and static platforms, meaning it can be embedded into nearly any social communication platform, including a city\u2019s website, Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn accounts. \n\u201cCities like to have traffic driving to their websites, so it made sense to us that a citizen could respond on those platforms,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cIn fact, one of our first steps with a potential partner is to evaluate where their engagement with their constituents happens.\u201d \n\u201cCities like to have traffic driving to their websites, so it made sense to us that a citizen could respond on those platforms.\u201d \n\u201cWho are they hearing from? Where is it coming from? Is it representative of the community? Once we figure out that a city has a touch point with 20, 30, 40 percent more of their community than they think, we can formulate an outreach plan to use Polco going forward.\u201d \nPolco offers a way to capture underrepresented voices and respond in real time. \n\u201cFor the first time, we can quantify a gap in communication,\u201d Mastronardi said. \u201cBefore, if it\u2019s a free-form town hall or an ambiguous survey, you\u2019re not characterizing who\u2019s participating, and by extension, you\u2019re not characterizing who is not participating. In real time, a city or a county can see if they\u2019re getting real participating from all districts, and if not, they can refocus their outreach to ensure that they are reaching the underrepresented in their community. We can do the same thing by age, geography, or gender. It\u2019s a way to find these missing voices and give voice to people who haven\u2019t been part of the process before.\u201d Finding a Safe Space \nIn a political season that has seen some United States representatives have refused to face their constituents , the question emerges whether Polco might have a solution. The answer right now is uncertain, but the company has started some experiments to test integrating Polco\u2019s verified response system with livestreaming platforms that might provide a safe space interface between a town hall, a politician\u2019s livestream, and their constituencies in real time. \nWhat happens when you digitize democracy ?

So are 36,000 other people. \nA woman waves emissions away from her face as one does secondhand smoke. Disc-jockeys play tunes. Models in jean shorts, cropped shirts, and heels push marketing materials. Tattoo companies offer temporary ink. Actors don Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse costumes. A clown makes animal balloons. \nAt this year\u2019s three-day IECIE eCig Expo , 1,000 companies from China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, U.K., and the U.S. exhibit e-cigarettes and paraphernalia, and the biggest takeaway is the astonishing versatility on display: heating coils, microprocessors, power inductors, tube casings, rechargeable batteries , and storage boxes. Attendees puff away on samples, billowing 10-foot-long clouds. \nBattery-powered e-cigarettes take various forms: standard rectangle, e-pens, e-lipstick, e-pipes, e-cigars, e-hookahs. They vaporize inhalable nicotine solutions known as e-liquids, e-juices, or oils, which are heated sans combustion, rendering them smokeless. Vaporizer cartridges accommodate dry herbs, tobacco leaves, and marijuana. Joshua Bateman/Digital Trends Joshua Bateman/Digital Trends \nSome e-cigarettes are simple and affordable. Others are smart devices with touchscreen multilanguage menus, firmware upgrades, and power bank options. Expensive pieces are art, made with stainless steel, zinc alloy, glass, leather, and wood accent panels. Suppliers advertise uptake efficiency, compactness, versatility, customization, and ergonomic designs. \nBeijing pharmacist Han Li invented e-cigarettes in 2003 and roughly nine-tenths of global production occurs in China, mostly in Shenzhen\u2019s industrial Bao\u2019an District, two hours outside the city center. In Bao\u2019an, Elego Technology Company, an e-cigarette exporter, sits nestled between hundreds of manufacturers, component suppliers, and warehouses. \nAttendees puff away on samples, billowing 10-foot-long clouds. \nWearing jeans, sneakers, and a black Elego T-shirt that reads \u201cBest Vape Wholesalers,\u201d sales representative Daisy Qiu, tells me e-cigarette aficionados clamor for the latest releases. \u201cIt is like a new fashion,\u201d she said. \u201cSmall innovations push the market.\u201d Team colors for the NFL Raiders, black and silver, are best-sellers. \nAround the office, 20-somethings work diligently. Empty shelves and moving boxes are harbingers that the company is relocating. With revenues growing 25 percent annually and expected headcount to reach 200 by year\u2019s end, Elego needs more space. \nOn one disk sit dozens of e-cigarettes waiting to be tested. As a third-party agent, Elego filters out subpar products. The company\u2019s reps visit factories to review production processes, cleanliness, and certifications. \nSales manager Michael Li said that a few inferior batteries and user error spawned exploding e-cigarettes years ago. \u201cBut now, it never happens because quality improved,\u201d he told Digital Trends. \u201cThe competition is very strong. So each manufacturer will try their best.\u201d Joshua Bateman/Digital Trends \nE-liquids contain nicotine, water, and propylene glycol, or vegetable glycerin. Flavors include standards like menthol and drip tobacco, as well as an immense assortment that reads like a stroll down the snack aisle: cookie, donut, ice-cream, vanilla custard, caramel, pretzel, bubble gum, mint, pina colada, wine, cola, root beer, black tea, and energy drink. Fruity varieties are punch, apple, banana, orange, peach, grape, cherry, strawberry, watermelon, pineapple, pomegranate, lychee, and kiwi. Companies highlight the flavors\u2019 sweetness, freshness, and cleanliness. \nElego exports e-cigarettes from China, but not e-liquids. \u201cAmerican liquids are the most popular,\u201d Li said. \nDriven by North America and Europe, the global e-cigarette market is forecast to grow 17 percent annually, reaching $27.7 billion by 2022. Elego exports to more than 60 countries. Americans prefer larger, higher wattage e-cigarettes with heftier vapor plumes. Brits like smaller models, the French even slimmer. \nE-cigarettes have barely dented the $770 billion tobacco industry, but Li thinks they could steal 30 percent market share in the upcoming decades. \u201cNew stuff, it takes time to get people to accept it,\u201d he said. \nDetecting opportunities, electronics and biotechnology conglomerates have entered the market. For example, iPhone manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group manufactures vape pods. Big Tobacco \u2014 British American Tobacco, R.J. Reynolds, Altria, Philip Morris International, and Imperial Tobacco \u2014 is also participating. \nThe Chinese smoke 45 percent of the world\u2019s cigarettes, but only a sliver of those 316 million smokers use e-cigarettes. Li said Chinese people are traditional and reluctant to try alien things. Few have ever heard of e-cigarettes. He believes youth will propel acceptance, however. Joshua Bateman/Digital Trends Joshua Bateman/Digital Trends \n\u201cYoung people, they like new stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cBut old people, they will stay old.\u201d \nTobacco costs encourage Westerners, but not Chinese, to embrace e-cigarettes. Unlike China, where packs of smokes can be had for less than $2 each, they may exceed $10 a pack in the U.S. and U.K., spurring the need for substitutes. Thus, Chinese adopters are the wealthy, not mass market. \nSmoking is also social. When lighting up, Chinese typically offer cigarettes to others. E-cigarettes sever this connection. \u201cThis is a really big problem,\u201d Li said. \nIf the government supports it, it will grow very fast. If not, we have to figure that out \nPolicymakers also influence market development. Because China\u2019s e-cigarette consumption market is immaterial, officials haven\u2019t meddled. If it cannibalizes tobacco consumption, however, additional taxes and controls could be levied. State-owned enterprise China National Tobacco Corporation is a near monopoly, manufacturing 98 percent of the tobacco products in China, throwing off approximately $150 billion annually in tax revenues. \nIn America, the Food and Drug Administration began regulating e-cigarettes last year and acknowledged they have both \u201cpotential benefits and risks.\u201d \n\u201cIf the government supports it, it will grow very fast. If not, we have to figure that out,\u201d Li said. \nTo oust unscrupulous manufacturers, Li welcomes stronger regulations in the fragmented, unchecked industry. Assorted paints, coatings, and chemicals are used in production, which can contaminate the aerosol. Studies have found worrying levels of nickel, chromium, and diethylene glycol \u2013 an antifreeze ingredient \u2013 which can infiltrate users\u2019 lungs. Joshua Bateman/Digital Trends \nAlthough long-term studies are lacking, e-cigarette advocates market them as healthier alternatives to smoking . This theory is centered on e-cigarettes vaporizing solutions, which don\u2019t burn tobacco like cigarettes do. According to a Public Health England report, e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than ordinary cigarettes. More than 480,000 Americans dying from smoke every year. \n\u201cPeople work so hard. Their health is not good. So, they need some stuff to cure smoking,\u201d Li said. \nOne expo attendee remained unconvinced, however. In a seating area, a solitary used cigarette butt lay on the floor. \nElsewhere, other researchers have raised misgivings. Dr. Shan-shan Chung, assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, studied e-cigarettes on behalf of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health. Chung said e-cigarettes present different risks than tobacco products, invalidating direct comparisons. \nChung found trace nicotine in e-cigarettes, but it poses less risk than it does in traditional cigarettes. As battery-powered electronics, though, e-cigarettes contain endocrine-disrupting polybrominated diphenyl (PBDE) and formaldehyde, a carcinogen, neither of which is present in cigarettes. Amounts vary greatly by manufacturer. \nThus, when using a questionable product, \u201c[a user\u2019s] health is very much in danger because he or she is absorbing one proven carcinogen and one developmental toxicant,\u201d Chung told Digital Trends. \nFor smokers contemplating switching , she said, \u201cNeither smoking nor vaping is advisable. Just quit because there is no evidence showing any one is better than the other.\u201d \nOthers fret over nonsmokers vaping, notably youth. After increasing 900 percent annually between 2011 and 2015, more U.S. high schoolers now use e-cigarettes than traditional tobacco products. \nIn a report , former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called youth usage \u201ca major public health concern.\u201d Murthy wrote, \u201cThe brain of youth and young adults is more vulnerable to the negative consequences of nicotine exposure. The effects include addiction, priming for use of other addictive substances, reduced impulse control, deficits in attention and cognition, and mood disorders.\u201d \nThe report conceded, however, that, \u201cGaps in scientific evidence do exist,\u201d and that \u201cthese products and their patterns of use continue to change quickly.\u201d \nAs governments and researchers investigate , the industry continues to mushroom. On stage at the exhibition, a boy band in white T-shirts rapped. One vaped away as another bellowed in his best Eminem impression, \u201c Zu\u00f2 h\u011bn d\u00e0de sh\u0113ngy\u00ec !\u201d (\u201cDo a lot of business!\u201d) \nWhile recognizing market maturation will take time, Li said of the industry, \u201cIt\u2019s really a bright future.\u201d \nJoshua Bateman is based in Greater China.

What is Windows Mixed Reality ? You\u2019ve probably seen the headlines by now, companies like Dell, Samsung , and Acer have all announced their own versions of virtual reality headsets built to be compatible with Microsoft\u2019s Windows Mixed Reality platform, but let\u2019s look at what that actually means. What is mixed reality? \nYou\u2019re going to get a different answer from everyone you ask, but at its core mixed reality is a term used for any technology that layers digital, or virtual, elements over the real world. Pokemon Go is a good example. By looking through your phone\u2019s camera, the game is able to create the illusion that digital elements, the Pokemon, are really in the space around you. That\u2019s mixed reality. \nAt this point you might be wondering whether that\u2019s any different from \u2018augmented reality\u2019 and the simple answer is: no. For the most part, AR is synonymous with MR. There are some experts out there who would disagree, who might define AR as something different entirely , or who might suggest \u2018mixed reality\u2019 is a spectrum, with AR and VR at opposite ends. They\u2019re not wrong. \nHowever, companies like Apple and Microsoft use these terms interchangeably, which means you\u2019re going to see them being used to describe the same technologies and products. The academic distinctions are still up in the air, and they might change over time. What\u2019s special about Windows Mixed Reality? \nWindows Mixed Reality is the name for Microsoft\u2019s particular brand of mixed reality. It\u2019s a unified platform like Windows, but for mixed reality headsets. \nAll Windows Mixed Reality headsets have inside-out tracking, which means the headset can tell which direction you\u2019re looking without having to look for external sensors like the lighthouses you use for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive . \nThat means you can use room-scale VR anywhere, not just where you have your sensors set up, and you don\u2019t have to worry about stepping out of range of the sensors. That alone sets these headsets apart from their competition. \nDespite the name \u201cmixed reality,\u201d however, these headsets will be compatible with standard virtual reality. In fact, most of the launch applications will focus on virtual reality experiences. \nThink of Windows Mixed Reality as you do Windows itself. It\u2019s a platform which Microsoft wants manufacturers \u2014 like Samsung, Acer, and Dell \u2014 to build products for. In the same way that Dell makes laptops which run Windows, it\u2019s also making mixed reality headsets for Windows Mixed Reality. Is it different from virtual reality? \nNot really. \nThink of Windows Mixed Reality as VR, plus a little extra. Microsoft is working to make sure Windows Mixed Reality headsets will be compatible with existing VR experiences and games, particularly those on the SteamVR store, but on top of that you\u2019ll be able to take advantage of \u2018mixed reality\u2019 experiences which layer virtual elements on top of the real world. \nThat\u2019s why all of the Windows Mixed Reality headsets have inside-out tracking. How developers end up using those capabilities will remain to be seen \u2014 though the upcoming Halo: Recruit experience is promising. But for now at least, Windows Mixed Reality headsets are providing a reasonably priced and standardized entry point into the whole virtual, augmented, and mixed reality experience, and giving HTC and Oculus some much-needed competition. \nDespite what the name may have you think, Windows Mixed Reality isn\u2019t important because it\u2019s pioneering a new type of experience. Instead, it\u2019s refining a range of virtual reality and augmented experiences and bringing them to more affordable price points, with native Windows support.

That\u2019s where renting comes in, offering all the camera without all the price in exchange for an expiration date. \nLensRentals is the largest photography and videography gear rental company in the United States, offering lenses, cameras, camcorders, accessories and even drones. Besides renting out gear for special shoots, the company also offers a sort of try before you buy program, where if you really bond with that rental, you can buy it outright and apply the rental fees towards the purchase price. \nI tried out two products from LensRentals to expand my gear list on an out-of-country trip, and found the service not only painless to use but quick and informative too. The rental process \nLensRentals has a wide variety of products available, all listed through an online portal. Finding the right gear is easy enough to find using the platform\u2019s different categories or just by typing in a search term. Gear is organized into categories for photo bodies, video bodies, lenses by mount, photo accessories, and video accessories. Another category allows for browsing by brand, while packages designed for a specific type of shoot \u2014 from weddings to portraits \u2014 are also easy to browse. \nAll gear is listed with a price for a seven-day rental to give a general idea of the rental cost. If the item isn\u2019t in stock, a colored note at the top will list when the gear will be available. Hillary Grigonis/Digital Trends \nClicking on the item brings up more options. Along with a quick review of the camera\u2019s key features, the page lists a Q&A section and vitals, like what lens mounts are compatible. On the right, adjusting the date range instantly updates the price, with time frames between three and 90 days available. On the opposite side, LensRentals suggests related gear, including lenses, memory cards and extra batteries. If you add the item to the cart and keep browsing, the prices will automatically adjust to reflect the date range you selected for the first item. \nThe rental and checkout process is as easy as ordering something from Amazon. At the checkout page, you\u2019ll be asked if you want Lenscap, which is insurance for damage to the gear. Lenscap offers two options, a damage-only option that applies to drops and bear attacks (helpful, considering I rented the Panasonic Lumix GH5 and actually shot a black bear with it) and Lenscap+, which covers both those scenarios as well as theft and natural disasters. The insurance is limited to $100,000 in damage. \nThe LensRentals system is designed to streamline the process while creating a positive user experience. \nShipping is not included, though Lensrentals does have an Amazon Prime-like option to subscribe for $99 to get free shipping for a year. A signature is required at delivery, so Lensrentals also offers the option to pick up at a FedEx location if you can\u2019t sit at home to wait for the delivery. \nThe system is designed to streamline the process while creating a positive user experience. In fact, just before checking out, I received an alert that a number of customers had complained about an item I had on my order because of trouble connecting to the app. I decided to order anyways and, sure enough, I had to troubleshoot my connection with the Osmo+ gimbal . The notice was unexpected but welcome, since with a shorter rental, I wouldn\u2019t have had the time required to mess around with the connection and get the gimbal functioning. \nLensRentals online ordering system is well-organized and easy to use. Once the first item is added to the cart, all of the other prices change to reflect the same rental period and suggested accessory lists make it easy to make sure you add everything you need. And if you don\u2019t, you might get a call \u2014 the day after my order, I received a call asking if I wanted to add any memory cards to the order. A quick \u201cwhoops, yes I\u2019ll need those\u201d and the cards were added on to my order. The Rental Experience \nShipping camera gear always makes us nervous, but our order arrived on time and packed inside a durable hard case with foam inserts. Besides just keeping bumps and drops from damaging the gear mid-ship, the setup also made it easy to pack the gear for a road trip. A hard case isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll want to hike around with \u2014 in which case, LensRentals has a small selection of backpacks \u2014 but leaves out the worry of damage during shipping. Hillary Grigonis/Digital Trends \nWe were able to start shooting right away: Everything we needed was included in the box. Throughout the rental, LensRentals kept in touch via emails. Since we rented during the eclipse, I received a note warning that shooting the sun without a protective filter would damage the gear , something not covered by the rental insurance. \nIf I stumbled onto that lost lens cap within 30 days, I could send it back and get a refund. \nA few days before the rental was due back, a reminder email arrived with a helpful checklist for everything that should be in the shipment, including batteries, chargers, and lens caps. Instructions for returning the rental were part of the first shipment, including new tape to seal it all up. We boxed it up, scheduled a FedEx pick-up online from the FedEx website, and sent the gear back. \nA few days later, another email showed up noting that the gear was received, minus one lens cap. We knew we were missing the cap when we shipped everything back (there must be a hidden compartment in somewhere in the den filled with lost lens caps and mismatched socks), so we approved the $5 charge. Customer service was incredibly easy to work with and noted that if we stumbled onto that lost treasure chest of missing lens caps and socks within 30 days, we could send it back and get a refund on the extra charge. The Verdict \nLensRentals offers a simple web ordering system, and we were surprised both by the quality and durability of the shipment boxes. Customer service when we lost a lens cap was also superb. The selection also makes it easy to get everything in one place, from the actual camera and lens to tripods, lighting, audio, drones and even bags to put it all in if that included hard case isn\u2019t going to work. An option to automatically schedule the return shipping pickup would be a nice addition, but the experience overall was hassle-free. \nOwning a camera makes sense for frequent use, but rental systems like LensRentals let you get that project-specific or trip-specific gear, and helps new professionals compete with the gear of photographers who have been shooting (and investing in lenses) for years. Sure, that $2,000 lens makes sense for wedding photographers that have nearly every weekend booked, but for photographers just starting out, LensRentals makes it possible to rent the same $2,000 24-70mm f/2.8 lens for three days for less than a hundred bucks. \nWe wouldn\u2019t hesitate to rent with LensRentals again.

The famed British brand just replaced the Continental GT with a brand new model, meaning the successors to the GTC and the Flying Spur are right around the corner. At the same time, the company needs to keep up with the latest trends in the automotive industry without losing its identity \u2013 or losing ground to the competition. \nWe sat down with Rolf Frech , Bentley\u2019s board member for engineering, to gain insight on what went into developing the second-generation Continental GT . He also revealed how the brand plans on uniting the timeless luxury it\u2019s known for with cutting-edge technology. \nDigital Trends: Bentley just introduced a brand-new Continental GT. Can you tell us a little bit about the design brief you gave your team? \nRolf Frech: I can trim it down to just one sentence: the new one had to be better than the old one. That\u2019s what was driving us. But, of course, that\u2019s just a short description of what we wanted to do. \nThe Continental GT is much more modern than before, but it\u2019s absolutely recognizable as a Bentley. \nWe looked at what the last GT delivered . The refinement, the luxury, the statement it made. We also explored areas where we could improve the car. We sought out the next level of chassis systems and the next generation of engine technology. We also looked at how to apply what we learned with the Bentayga , especially the 48-volt EAWS system . Those are all elements we baked into it. \nStarting early in the process, we took the chance to move the front axle forward to reduce the front overhang. This gave designers the freedom to shape a completely new car with completely different proportions. We kept the haunch, this is one of Bentley\u2019s typical design elements, but we took inspiration from the EXP 10 Speed 6 concept . It\u2019s much more modern than before, but it\u2019s absolutely recognizable as a Bentley. \nWhat is your favorite part of it? \nFor me? It\u2019s the whole vehicle. It\u2019s not just the summation of technologies. It\u2019s a piece of art \u2013 that\u2019s how I would describe it. It\u2019s not that I praise my engine guy or my chassis guy, I say everybody in my team did really well. I\u2019m really proud. Ronan Glon/Digital Trends \nTo be honest, we had an easy job. Whenever you are looking to design a new car, you have to look for the benchmark in the segment. You have to buy benchmark cars. For us it was easy: we had it, and we just wanted to build it better. A lot of the people who worked on the new car also worked on its predecessor, so they knew exactly what to do. \nWe have to ask about the rotating screen . The first question is, why do it? And how complicated was it to design? \nIt\u2019s our interpretation of innovative technology. Since Tesla hit the market, everybody is talking about big screens. Some of the cars today look like they are driving televisions. That\u2019s not Bentley. On the other hand, we did want to have the information available whenever it\u2019s necessary. \nSomebody came up with the idea of giving customer choices. Does he want to see the analog instrumentation? Does he only want to see the wood veneer? Or, does he need the screen? For information, or maybe for the co-driver who is looking for music or whatever. And then somebody came up with this crazy idea. \nThere are a lot of Swiss elements in the car, actually. The Toblerone -shaped rotating piece is one, but the mechanism is almost like what you\u2019d find in a Swiss watch. It doesn\u2019t just rotate; the screen has to move backwards, then it goes up, and then it rotates. The next side comes back, goes down, comes forward, and then it\u2019s aligned. \nIt\u2019s sophisticated, but it works. It gave me some of my gray hairs. But, since we unveiled the car, I don\u2019t think we need to test it any longer. So many people who checked out the new GT at the Frankfurt show have pressed the switch! \nThe basic idea was driven by customer expectations. What do our customers want? We didn\u2019t want to follow the path everybody is taking. Everyone puts in the biggest available screen, and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s not what we do at Bentley. I think the screen is not only a talking piece, it\u2019s also something the customers will enjoy. \nImagine there is a doctor in a hospital. All day he performed surgeries and so on, and in the evening he\u2019s tired. He drives home, but he knows the way. He doesn\u2019t need the information on the screen, he just wants to enjoy the drive. So, he turns it around to the side with the dials or the veneer. This example describes exactly why we made such a sophisticated element for this car. \nChanging gears for a second. Volkswagen Group boss Matthias M\u00fcller announced a widespread electrification offensive that implicates the entire business. Every single model from every single brand will be electrified by 2030. Does that change Bentley\u2019s plans for the future? \nNo, we were already planning on it . By 2019 at the latest, all of our models will be available with a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) drivetrain. That time frame is for Europe, it might be a little bit later in the United States. This is the first step. \nEverybody says PHEV technology is a bridge. For me, for Bentley, I think it\u2019s not a bridge. It\u2019s a technology which gives you all the possibilities. \nWe\u2019re already thinking about the second step. We showed it to the world in Geneva this year when we introduced the EXP 12 Speed 6E . It\u2019s a concept car, but we wanted to prove to the world luxury doesn\u2019t have to end where electrification starts. Look at the current cars. I don\u2019t want to say too much, but they are not on the level you would expect from a completely new modern car. We wanted to show there is also a possibility for Bentley to get into this world. \nWe are working on ideas, we are working on concepts, of course. There are elements available, modules available from the group, but if we are going for it we will make a pure and proper Bentley, believe me. It will be a pure Bentley. When? The question is how fast will electro-mobility come up. It\u2019s not about the products, the question is about the infrastructure. To get an acceptable range you have to have the latest technology, like an 800-volt charging system . \nOn the other side, to be honest, everybody talks about how PHEV technology is a bridge. For me, for Bentley, I think it\u2019s not a bridge. It\u2019s a technology which gives you all the possibilities. \nYou mentioned an electrified Bentley would have to be a proper Bentley. Can you define, in your words, what is a proper Bentley? \nA proper Bentley for me is like one of our slogans: driving luxury performance. All of these elements have to be present in our cars. Driving, okay, luxury, okay. I think we can make an electric car that\u2019s also luxurious, we showed it with the Speed 6E. Performance; if you drive an electric car it\u2019s impressive because the torque is always there. \nCan you adapt autonomous technology and still stay true to your slogan? \nI can answer the question easily: autonomous driving is already at Bentley. A lot of our customers have chauffeurs . \nTo be more precise, we are working on autonomous technology. There will be situations where you are happy someone is taking over the steering wheel. In cities, for example. But there will also be other situations where our customers really want to drive the car. So, we have to make the technology available. We also need to ask ourselves, \u201care we building special cars for that?\u201d Or, should we integrate these elements into existing cars so customers can choose whether to use them?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bentley rolf frech", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rolf frech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentayga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthias m\u00fcller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "volkswagen group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "continental", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gtc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phev", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "frankfurt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T08:14:10.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efd1cda05e3ca1bc2a9aed39266f93977e7f11b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB78pkQDl67zaCId6s9Ru2IDcW7SW7qtR8erskEnqtFhWbkQ5IRQg7RUTEoJK97SZC", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Nikon D850 Review: A need for speed meets exceptional resolution | Digital Trends", "title_full": "Nikon D850 Review: A need for speed meets exceptional resolution | Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-03T16:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.052, "main_image": "https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/nikon-d850-review-2-2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 32, "comments": 0, "shares": 32}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efd1cda05e3ca1bc2a9aed39266f93977e7f11b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB78pkQDl67zaCId6s9Ru2IDcW7SW7qtR8erskEnqtFhWbkQ5IRQg7RUTEoJK97SZC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hillary Grigonis", "published": "2017-10-03T16:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nikon D850 Review: A need for speed meets exceptional resolution | Digital Trends", "text": "Nikon D800 \nWhile the camera is heavier than crop sensor DSLRs and mirrorless cameras, the large grip makes for comfortable shooting. Using the D850 from early morning sunrise shots to astrophotography that same night, we didn\u2019t find it particularly uncomfortable, though investing in a better-quality strap is a good idea for any camera of this size. Stepping up the Speed \nThe D850 may produce RAW files in the upper 50-megabyte range, but the camera handles them like files that are half the size. (Three RAW size options are available, but the top speed is still available with the largest option). Unaided, the D850 shoots at a respectable 7 fps, while adding the optional battery grip (which costs $400, plus another $150 for the EN-EL18b battery) pushes that number to 9 fps. \nWe should point out that while the D850 is the first true DSLR to pair such high resolution and high speed numbers, it is not the first DSLR-like camera to do so. The Sony A99 Mark II (which uses a translucent mirror and electronic viewfinder) features a 42MP sensor and can shoot at up to 12 fps. The Sony, however, suffered from a small 25-shot image buffer and some autofocus limitations that made its high-speed mode less attractive. \nThe D850 has no such drawbacks. Shooting uncompressed, 14-bit RAW files, the camera can keep up its maximum speed for around 51 frames before hitting the limits of the imaging buffer. After reaching that maximum, the camera keeps shooting at a slightly lower speed. Drop down to 12-bit RAWs, and the D850 will churn out 150 shots before slowing down. \nPhotographing both motocross and whitewater kayakers, we had no problem working within the limitations of the buffer. The buffer size doesn\u2019t change with the battery grip, but at that higher speed, you reach the 51 frames faster and, likewise, shooting speed drops sooner. \nA good burst speed is nothing without a good autofocus system \u2014 thankfully, the D850 doesn\u2019t disappoint. \nOne thing to note here is that performance does change when the battery is on the last bar. Speed drops in half, and shooting will simply stop when the buffer is full. Try to keep a fresh battery on hand if you always want maximum performance. \nFortunately, you shouldn\u2019t find yourself in this situation too often; the D850 has exceptional battery life, rated at 1,840 shots. Starting at sunrise, we made it through most of the day on a single charge, finally swapping the battery out just before nightfall when it was on the last bar. \nA good burst speed is nothing without a good autofocus system, and, thankfully, the D850 doesn\u2019t disappoint. Shooting action, we swapped between the single-point continuous and 3D autofocus modes and captured an impressive number of sharply focused shots. A handful of misses were simply due to user error (not getting the focus point on the subject), and there were just a few others where the camera got it wrong by a small margin. \nThe D850 has an excellent autofocus system and burst speed, but the camera\u2019s performance using live-view mode on the LCD screen doesn\u2019t live up to the same standards of shooting with the viewfinder. The tilting LCD screen gives photographers a reason to shoot stills onscreen instead of through the viewfinder, along with multiple manual focus tools including split view and focus peaking that are not available through the viewfinder. But, there\u2019s a big gap in autofocus performance between the optical viewfinder and live-view. Live view autofocus speed is sufficient for landscapes, but motocross, not so much. Hillary Grigonis/Digital Trends \nThe problem isn\u2019t unique to the D850 \u2014 when a DSLR uses live view, the mirror has to be locked up in place, which redirects light away from the dedicated autofocus sensor and forces the camera to focus using the imaging sensor. However, other companies (namely Canon with its Dual Pixel AF tech) have built ways around this limitation; Nikon is still lagging behind. \nTo be fair, the D850\u2019s live-view autofocus is an improvement over older Nikons; but it\u2019s still considerably slower than using the viewfinder. \nThis also impacts video, which, as with any DSLR, requires putting the camera into live-view mode. The D850 hunts in and out before locking focus, which makes it difficult to keep up with a moving subject. For motocross, we found that using manual focus and pre-focusing where we anticipated our subject to be was sometimes the only way to ensure a sharp result. \nThe live-view mode has one big redeeming factor, though: completely silent shooting. \nIs the live-view autofocus a deal breaker? Probably not. Most sports photographers are going to use the viewfinder, anyway. Most pro-level videographers use manual focus and a follow focus system. (And amateurs would never touch this camera.) For shooting landscapes from unusual angles or for using manual focus peaking, the tilting LCD screen is excellent. \nThe live-view mode has one big redeeming factor, though: completely silent shooting. Like most high-end DSLRs, the D850 has a rather expected, comforting shutter sound while shooting. When using the viewfinder, there\u2019s a quiet mode to dampen the sound \u2014 but \u201cquieter\u201d would be a better name, since it\u2019s just a softer but still obvious click. \nIn live view, however, you can shoot completely silent thanks to a new electronic shutter option. Add that to the tilt screen, and the feature makes it easier to shoot candid photos. If you prefer to hear that click \u2014 since it\u2019s actually hard to tell that the D850 is taking the photo without it \u2014 the noise can be turned on by tapping the \u201ci\u201d button and accessing the live-view shooting options. Connectivity \nThe D850 packs in both Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi for connecting to Nikon\u2019s Snapbridge app. With Bluetooth alone, which Nikon refers to as Snapbridge, you can automatically back up 2-megapixel JPEG versions of your photos as you shoot, or remotely control the camera. Through Wi-Fi, you can send full-resolution files to your phone, but transferring those 46MP files can be a slow process. \nAs a remote, the Snapbridge app is basic but functional. The controls are minimal. Any adjustments to exposure settings need to be done on the camera itself. The remote view does offer touch-to-focus, however, with autofocus performance similar to how the on-camera live view works. \nWhile Bluetooth is supposed to make the initial setup process easier, establishing the first connection was tricky \u2014 after several attempts, we reinstalled the app and finally got a connection. We also lost connection a few times while transferring files, and once had to restart the camera before the Wi-Fi connection would work. \nWireless connectivity is nice for sharing images on social media quickly, but performance and reliability just isn\u2019t there yet for more serious use. Image quality \nWith a 45.7-megapixel full-frame sensor, the D850 shoots files that are a whopping 8,256-pixels wide. With such a high resolution, it\u2019s no surprise that the D850 captures exceptional detail. With that higher resolution, zooming and cropping is no problem. \nThe tradeoff for more megapixels is often noise, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue here. The D850 uses a backside-illuminated sensor, just the second full-frame model to do so after Sony\u2019s A7R II . This improves light sensitivity, and in our experience, high-ISO photographs came out with a low level of noise. \nEven at ISO 6,400, noise wasn\u2019t detectable until after zooming in past 50 percent. We wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use even higher settings when necessary, especially when you\u2019re outputting to a smaller file size. \nNikon has always had great color science and this is another area where the D850 doesn\u2019t disappoint. Colors are accurate, popping without being oversaturated. \nWith the D850, Nikon also introduced two new auto white balance modes that allow you to choose a warmer or cooler look without using a custom white balance. While white balance is easy to adjust on RAW files, this simple change helped create JPEGs that were already excellent straight from the camera. \nThe D850 also captures great dynamic range, with detail from shadows to highlights. JPEGs shot in soft lighting are excellent straight from the camera, while trickier lighting in high-contrast scenes will benefit from the greater dynamic range in the RAW files. Shooting kayaking, we had no problem obtaining detail in both the white wash of the river and the kayakers\u2019 faces once we made adjustments in Adobe Camera RAW. Video and time-lapse \nWith such high resolution, the D850 is capable of shooting 8K time-lapses, but only if you\u2019re willing to compile them yourself in post. In-camera, you can create 4K time-lapses, however. The camera features both standard intervalometer shooting, which will take photos at regularly spaced intervals but leave them as individual files, and a time-lapse movie mode, which will render the shots as a video file in-camera. Users after the most control and resolution should stick to the intervalometer mode, but the time-lapse mode is welcome for its ease of use and time savings. \nThe D850 can also shoot 4K video at 30 fps, and while it\u2019s not Nikon\u2019s first 4K camera, it is the first to shoot 4K from the full width of the sensor. The D5, D500, and D7500 all shoot 4K by cropping. We found video quality to be excellent, with sharp detail and rich color, and getting the full-frame look in video mode is a definite plus. \nStepping down to 1080p resolution, the D850 offers 120-fps slow motion options at 4x and 5x, a feature that\u2019s difficult to find in-camera. The detail isn\u2019t as good with the lower resolution, but the feature makes for some pretty slick action sequences with minimal effort. \nAs we mentioned before, the autofocus in video mode isn\u2019t great. Like with any DSLR, serious videographers are going to want to accessorize with a follow focus system. Our Take \nThe Nikon D850 mixes big resolution and snappy speed inside a familiar and durable magnesium alloy body. Add in excellent image quality, excellent autofocus (except in live view), 8K and 4K time-lapses, 4K video, 120 fps Full HD slow motion, and a well-organized control scheme and the D850 is on track for the best DSLR of the year. \nLive-view autofocus doesn\u2019t live up to the standard set by Canon, not to mention mirrorless cameras, and Snapbridge connectivity isn\u2019t 100-percent reliable. There\u2019s also no pop-up flash, and while we understand that\u2019s not a big issue for most users, having a built-in wireless flash commander was always a nice touch in previous D800-series cameras. \nThe Nikon D850 lists for $3,300, but that cost jumps to about $3,850 once you tack on the accessories required to hit the 9 fps speed. However, considering the two-year-old 50MP Canon 5DSR still carries an MSRP of $3,899, shoots at 5 fps, and doesn\u2019t have a backlit sensor or 4K video, we can\u2019t argue that the D850 is overpriced. It is positioned very competitively for what it is. \nIs there a better alternative? \nThe D850 has neither the absolute highest resolution nor the fastest performance of full-frame cameras out there, but it\u2019s an incredible mix of both. The aforementioned Canon 5DSR has a slight edge on resolution, but falls woefully behind in every other area. The more well-rounded 5D Mark IV is the closest competitor, with a 30MP sensor, 7 fps continuous shooting, and 4K video (albeit from a crop). But with 61 autofocus points and a poorer 900-shot battery life, the D850 still stands out. \nMoving to the mirrorless arena leaves Sony, assuming you want to keep that full-frame sensor. The A9 boasts an unbeatable 20 fps burst rate and impressive sensor-shift image stabilization, but its sensor contains just 24 megapixels. Being mirrorless, it also suffers inferior battery life, with 480 shots per charge. The A7R II comes close in resolution, but has a 5 fps burst rate and a paltry 24-frame buffer. It does have an edge in video, however, with advanced features like S-Log and superior autofocus. \nHow long will it last? \nThe D850 is the replacement to the D810, which launched in 2014. If Nikon follows the same pattern, the replacement to the D850 could be arriving around 2020. With industry-leading specs, many can likely continue to use the camera past when the replacement is announced, just like the D810 remains a strong camera even by today\u2019s standards. Factor in the rugged design, and the D850 is likely to last many years. \nShould you buy it? \nIf you want a pro-level camera that mixes both resolution and speed, buy the D850 \u2014 it won\u2019t disappoint. But if you plan to shoot lots of fast-paced video using autofocus, you\u2019re simply better off with a mirrorless or a dedicated camcorder, since the live view autofocus speed still leaves much to be desired. \nThe Nikon D850 is a DSLR without sacrifices, balancing both speed and excellent image quality within the same camera. It\u2019s obviously built with high-end users in mind, but it should be an easy choice for such photographers.

Watch how the entire aircraft spins rapidly as it comes in to land. \n\u201cThe pole constrains the lateral or sideways movement of the UAV when being launched or recovered so strong winds cannot dislodge them, and avoids any damage to personnel nearby,\u201d BAE Systems explains in a report. \nBAE says the design incorporates not only adaptive flight control, but also advanced navigation and guidance software. The fixed-wing element affords the autonomous flying machine greater speed and range, while the rotary-wing mode allows it to hover for a safe vertical take-off and landing. \nIf, as its creators envisage, the drone ever finds its way onto the battlefield, multiple machines could be sent out in one go, returning quickly to base once the mission is complete. \nThe company talks about how the UAVs could \u201cbetter adapt to evolving future battlefield situations and, through working together in a swarm, tackle sophisticated air defenses, as well as operating in complex and cluttered urban environments.\u201d \nCommenting on the drone\u2019s design, BAE Systems \u2019 futurist and technologist Nick Colosimo said, \u201cThe battlefield of the future will require novel solutions to meet emerging threats and to keep human operators safe wherever they may be. \nColosimo adds, \u201cThe Adaptable UAVs concept and related technologies are one of a number of concepts being explored through close collaboration between industry and students in academia.\u201d \nThis isn\u2019t the first time BAE has invested in drone technology research.

You can now get Hasselblad\u2019s latest ... but it won't come cheap. \nUntil now, photographers who\u2019ve wanted to get their hands on Hasselblad\u2019s 100-megapixel monster, the H6D-100c , have had to do so in the form of a kit that included both the medium-format camera body, as well as the digital back. \nNo longer is that the case. You can now pick up the H6D-100c as only a digital back \u2014 but don\u2019t expect it to be much cheaper. \nTo refresh your memory, the H6D-100c Digital Back is built around a 100-megapixel 53.4 \u00d7 40.0mm CMOS sensor. The sensor features 15 stops of dynamic range and uses Hasselblad\u2019s Natural Colour Solution in conjunction with 16-bit color data to capture the greatest amount of detail possible. \nIn addition to 100-megapixels still photographs, the H6D-100c Digital Back captures 4K video In Hassleblad\u2019s proprietary RAW video format. This footage can then be converted to Adobe\u2019s Cinema DNG format in Hassleblad\u2019s Phocus software, where it can then be exported for use in more standardized editing programs. \nOn the rear of the digital back is a 3-inch, 920K-dot touchscreen that works as both a means to navigate the menu system, as well as view photos captured and stored on the device. \nPhotos and videos captured with the H6D-100c Digital Back are stored on either CFast or SD cards, both of which have dedicated slots onboard. If you prefer to shoot tethered or have an extra monitor on hand, there\u2019s also a USB 3 type-C connection, as well as a 1080p HDMI out. \nThe H6D-100c Digital Back also works alongside Hasselblad\u2019s Phocus app . This iOS-exclusive effectively works as a remote control for the digital back, but has to be connected to a host computer running MacOS or Windows. When connected, it gives full control over the creative controls of the camera and also lets you sort through and rate images captured and stored on the device. \nThe benefit of offering it as a standalone purchase is that it can be used alongside a slew of other camera systems, ranging from other Hasselblad bodies to custom large-format cameras. \nDespite the decoupling of the H6D-100c Digital Back and its main body, it doesn\u2019t exactly make it cheap.

The sight of an entire table of diners gazing not at their lovingly prepared meals but instead at their message-giving smartphones is an increasingly common one that\u2019s led some restaurateurs to take matters into their own hands. \nTake the naked restaurant in London, for example, where, as its name suggests, diners had to dine in the buff, forcing them to leave their tech at the door, though it\u2019s possible some sneaky diners slipped their device into an accommodating crack or fold. \nThen there was the Israeli eatery that offered diners a whopping 50 percent discount if they switched off their phones during their visit because the owner wanted nothing more than for them to \u201cenjoy the food and enjoy the company.\u201d Laupicarde/Instagram \nAnd how can we forget Phone Stack , a restaurant game that punished the first person to grab their phone by forcing them to pay for the entire table at the end of the meal. \nThe latest effort aimed at getting diners to engage with one another rather than with their handsets comes from award-winning chef Marco Canora. Based at Tuscan-American restaurant Hearth in Manhattan, Canora has placed special boxes on each table. On the box reads a note: \u201cOpen me!\u201d, while inside it another says, \u201cWe\u2019d like to invite you to unplug during your meal here at Hearth. Feel free to use this box to put your phone away and connect with your fellow diners.\u201d \nDiscussing the novel idea with dining guide Eater , Canora said, \u201cIf there\u2019s one time in the 24 hours in your day that\u2019s a time to engage with the person you\u2019re with, it makes sense to me that it\u2019s around the dinner table.\u201d \nThe chef originally thought about offering to take phones from diners before seating them, but ditched the plan because of what he described as \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d among many city folks. Giving your phone up at the door might also be a step too far for many tech-addicted diners, with a box on the table an altogether more acceptable solution (because you can grab it any time, y\u2019see). \nCanora told Eater that about 60 percent of diners are using the boxes, though he\u2019s keen to point out that diners don\u2019t need to feel bad if they ignore them. \n\u201cIf you want to do it, you can do it; if you don\u2019t want to do it, don\u2019t,\u201d the chef said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just a box on the table that\u2019s there if you want it.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "canora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marco canora", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tuscan-american", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hearth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:22:50.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dcff5e667f536262e874ff01a9e8bcdb19071ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXBBRj75XtBYyXbNfjjluVgwpKPEqO5LBFRTcfEGE0vZuLmgM7A5l4CJ", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/IpNewsflash-IpNewsWithinTheLast24Hours", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "IP Newsflash - news of the week", "title": "Trademark filings reveal LG may be working on its own in-house processor - Digital Trends (26 visits)", "title_full": "Trademark filings reveal LG may be working on its own in-house processor - Digital Trends (26 visits)", "published": "2017-10-04T17:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/lg-v30-on-phone-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0dcff5e667f536262e874ff01a9e8bcdb19071ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXBBRj75XtBYyXbNfjjluVgwpKPEqO5LBFRTcfEGE0vZuLmgM7A5l4CJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T17:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trademark filings reveal LG may be working on its own in-house processor - Digital Trends (26 visits)", "text": "Home > Mobile > LG may take on Samsung's Exynos chips with\u2026 LG may take on Samsung's Exynos chips with new custom mobile processors Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you LG's own mobile processors could mean faster LG phones, with more custom features in the future. \nLG has filed for two new brand name trademarks with the European Intellectual Property Office, but neither is related to smartphones, televisions, or white goods. At least, not directly. Instead, the trademarked names are processors, the Kromax and the Epik . The descriptions are very vague, referring to them only as \u201cChips\u201d and \u201cMultiprocessor Chips,\u201d and there\u2019s no indication what devices these processors may end up powering. \nLG produces a wide range of products, making it possible the Kromax and Epik chips could end up powering anything from refrigerators to robots, but it\u2019s entirely possible these chips are destined for use inside a smartphone. LG has dabbled with making its own processor in the past, called the Nuclun, which wasn\u2019t a success. It powered a single model, the LG G3 Screen \u2014 yes, it was that long ago \u2014 and wasn\u2019t designed to take on the fastest chips from Qualcomm at the time. While rumors then spread of a more powerful Nuclun 2 processor, the chip itself was never released. \nThis may be because LG\u2019s plans changed. In August 2016, LG and Intel announced a collaboration where it would, \u201cproduce a world-class mobile platform based on Intel Custom Foundry\u2019s 10nm design platform.\u201d At the same time, Intel and ARM announced they would work together on the development of an ARM system-on-a-chip based on Intel\u2019s 10nm process. Could the Kromax and the Epik be the result of LG, Intel, and ARM all coming together? \nNot only is it possible, it also makes sense. When LG released the LG G6 earlier this year it included the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor inside, and not the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, due to a lengthy wait time on the chip, because Samsung had a hold on the earliest shipments for use in the Galaxy S8 . LG eventually used the Snapdragon 835 in the LG V30 . Samsung has its own processor line, the Exynos, which is used in some internationally launched Galaxy phones and tablets. It also licenses them out to other brands, such as Meizu. \nIf the Kromax and Epik are future LG smartphone processors, the company could avoid having to settle for an older processor again in the future, should similar industry deals get in its way. An Intel/LG chip built using the 10nm process would be comparable to the Snapdragon 835 and the Samsung Exynos 9 8895, and provide LG with more ways to differentiate and customize its devices.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nuclun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qualcomm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intel custom foundry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european intellectual property office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung exynos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "meizu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kromax", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:28:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48a2c8e599766ac16e6fb7fd195286c78d6c6b58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz7tjfNWJW4r3A9CZkxI.6wA5fM3tIg9p0HV7PMVTar0W4e79BVjeB002kMVbEPjmlXPNm2uQIzHdA--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "How To Convert A PDF Into An Excel Document - 3 Options | Digital Trends", "title_full": "How To Convert A PDF Into An Excel Document - 3 Options | Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-04T13:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.025, "main_image": "https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/excel-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg?ver=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 24, "comments": 0, "shares": 24}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48a2c8e599766ac16e6fb7fd195286c78d6c6b58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz7tjfNWJW4r3A9CZkxI.6wA5fM3tIg9p0HV7PMVTar0W4e79BVjeB002kMVbEPjmlXPNm2uQIzHdA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jon Martindale", "published": "2017-10-04T13:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How To Convert A PDF Into An Excel Document - 3 Options | Digital Trends", "text": "The best laptops you can buy Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: \nJust because your coworker sent you a PDF file instead of the Excel document you wanted, doesn\u2019t mean you have to stick with it. In this guide, we\u2019ll teach you how to convert a PDF into an Excel document in a few quick and easy steps. We\u2019ll even teach you a few different ways to do it. \nIf you don\u2019t want to go to the trouble of converting the PDF (whether password protected or not ) and would rather just edit it as is, we have a guide to the best PDF editors, too. Adobe Acrobat DC \u2013 Premium app conversion \nAs one of the world\u2019s premier PDF reading and editing applications, Adobe Acrobat DC is one of the more popular methods for converting a PDF into an Excel file. As fully featured as it is though, it is a paid-for, premium application. Fortunately, there is a free trial, so if you\u2019re just looking to do a one-off conversion, this method works great. \nStep 1: Download Adobe Acrobat DC\u2019s seven-day trial and install it. \nStep 2: Open the software and select the \u201cTools\u201d tab. \nStep 3: Click the \u201cExport PDF\u201d icon. \nStep 4: Click \u201cSelect a file\u201d and choose the PDF you want to convert from the resulting window. Then, select \u201cSpreadsheet\u201d from the list of export options and decide whether you want an \u201cExcel Workbook\u201d (.xlsx), or \u201cXML Spreadsheet 2003\u201d (.xml) format. \nStep 5: If you want to adjust your eventual Excel document\u2019s settings, click the gear icon on the right-hand side of your selection. You can choose how many worksheets are created, as well as what symbols were used as data separators. \nStep 6: When happy with your settings, click the blue \u201cExport\u201d button. \nStep 7: Decide where you want to save your new Excel document. Either pick one of the \u201cRecent Folders\u201d on show, or click the blue \u201cChoose a Different Folder\u201d button. In the resulting pop-up file browser, click \u201cSave.\u201d \nDepending on the complexity of your data set and the speed of your computer, you may have a short wait while the conversion takes place. Once completed, the new Excel document will automatically open. You have now officially converted your PDF to an Excel document. Tabula \u2013 Free app conversion \nThe issue with using Adobe Acrobat DC to convert a PDF into an Excel document is that eventually, you have to pay for the privilege. If you want a more long-term solution that doesn\u2019t mean breaking out your credit card, Tabula is a popular free alternative that runs from within your browser. It doesn\u2019t change your PDF into an Excel document itself, but it extracts the PDF\u2019s data into a format that Excel can read without difficulty. \nStep 1: Download Tabula and run its installer. Don\u2019t be concerned about the Command Prompt window that appears, that\u2019s part of the process. \nStep 2: Run the Tabula application and it will open a new window in your web browser of choice . If it doesn\u2019t, do it yourself and input \u201chttp://127.0.0.1:8080/\u201d into the address bar and hit the \u201cEnter\u201d key. \nStep 3: Click the \u201cBrowse\u201d button and select the PDF you want to convert. Then click \u201cImport.\u201d \nStep 4: A processing bar will then appear. Wait for it to complete the importing process. \nStep 5: Either manually select the content you want to extract from the PDF by clicking and dragging boxes around it, or use the \u201cAutoDetect\u201d tables button to have it find tabled data automatically. Once you\u2019re happy with the selection, click the green \u201cPreview & Export Extracted Data\u201d button. \nStep 6: Select your chosen export format using the drop-down menu \u2014 the default \u201cCSV\u201d should be fine for most \u2014 and then click the \u201cExport\u201d button. \nYour PDF data has now been extracted and saved into its own file. You can now open that in Excel, and edit it at your leisure. Tabello \u2013 Freemium extension \nTabello is another easy-to-use method for converting a PDF to an Excel document and it does it through a browser extension. Currently compatible with the Chrome browser, it\u2019s able to convert a PDF\u2019s contents into an Excel-friendly format right in your browser. No need to download the PDF and upload it somewhere else or run it through a conversion tool. Find the content you want, select it, and export it straight away. \nWe received an assertion from the developer that Tabello also retains all private information locally and only ever sends tabular structure data to a remote server, so your information should be entirely protected while making the conversion. \nBetter yet, it\u2019s entirely free for your first five conversions, so if you just need a one-off or a handful of conversions, Tabello works great. After that, you can spend five dollars per 20 conversions, or pay a monthly subscription for ongoing service. \nTabello\u2019s only real downside is its limitation to the Chrome browser (for now) and the fact that it doesn\u2019t work with PDF images as of yet. \nStep 1: Install the Tabello Extension through the Chrome Web Store (along with some of our other favorites ), or visit its homepage for easy navigational links. \nStep 2: Find the PDF you want. Either navigate to its URL, or open the local PDF in Chrome. That latter option takes an extra quick step to enable local file parsing, but Tabello walks you through it easily. \nStep 3: Click the Tabello icon in the top right-hand corner to activate it. \nStep 4: Follow the on-screen instructions to select the content you want to convert to an Excel-friendly format. \nStep 5: Once you\u2019ve selected your content, it will automatically be converted. Click the \u201cCopy to Clipboard\u201d button at the bottom. \nStep 6: Open Excel or a compatible editor and paste the content directly into it. That\u2019s it! Your content is now in Excel. PDFtoExcel.com \u2013 Free online conversion \nIf you can\u2019t install applications on your system, or would simply rather a remote server did the brunt of the work for you, you can convert a PDF to an Excel document online instead. Although there are a number of online converters out there, our favorite is PDFtoExcel.com because it\u2019s free, has a clean interface, and does its job quickly. \nIt\u2019s important to note that although PDFtoExcel does pledge to remove all files within six hours of upload and doesn\u2019t look at the contents of your files, you are still sending them to a remote server. If you\u2019re working with important data, consider a local conversion solution instead. \nStep 1: Open a browser window and go to PDFtoExcel.com . \nStep 2: Click the \u201cUpload\u201d button and select your chosen PDF, or drag and drop it onto the designated area. \nStep 3: You\u2019ll see a progress bar appear for the upload itself, followed by another for the conversion process.

On October 4, Adobe announced Adobe Elements 2018, which includes Adobe Elements Organizer 2018, Photoshop Elements 2018 and Premiere Elements 2018 . The list of updates includes an auto curate option to select the best shots, new auto select tools, and several other new features. \nWith Adobe Elements 2018 , the basic software suite moves from a version number to a year number format, joining the same nomenclature as the fully-fledged programs like Photoshop 2017. Moving forward, Adobe says future updates will also use the new naming structure. \nA tool to eliminate the tedious task of turning hundreds of images into a dozen of the best shots headlines the list of new features, an option available in Elements Organizer. Adobe says the new feature will automatically pick the best shot, using factors such as quality, faces and the subject. \nAdobe Elements Organizer \nChoosing the best shots is a completely new idea, but one that lives largely in photo apps and not desktop software. EyeEm and Google Photos , for example, include artificial intelligence that automatically rates photos, while Everypixel Aesthetic is a platform dedicated entirely to the task of determining just how good a shot is. Even Adobe\u2019s more advanced photo organizer, Lightroom 2017, does not have an auto curate feature. \nA similar idea applies to the second new feature to Elements Organizer, with a one-click option to put those best photos into a slideshow. \nPhotoshop Elements is also gaining a number of new automated edits, included an Automatic Selection tool. Adobe says the tool allows users to click and drag and the program will automatically refine the edge to select an object. \nA second update makes those group photo blinks not such a big deal. The auto fix opens closed eyes, but in order for the tool to work, users need a second image with the eyes opened. The tool is designed for editing group photos and fixing a shot where everyone looks great except for a blink or two. Using data from a second eyes-open photo, Photoshop Elements will automatically blend them into the edited photo. \nThe automatic curation and blink fix follows the previous version\u2019s addition of tools to automatically correct a smile with facial recognition features and intelligent search options. \nAdobe\u2019s basic video editor, Premiere Elements, also sees a few new tools, including a \u201cCandid Moments\u201d tool that allows users to grab a still photo from the video footage, choosing the peak moment. Automatic edits also come into video with a Smart Trim tool, an auto option for trimming footage to the best shots. Adobe says the trim mode makes choices based on the \u201cstyle\u201d of the video, but that users can also customize the parameters to tweak what the software selects automatically. \nThe updates also come with eight new guided edits, in-app tutorials that walk users through the process of creating a specific look. New options include guides for swapping backgrounds, creating double exposures, adding overlays and creating a watercolor look. For video, Elements will now guide users through those bounce-back GIFs where an action is played back and forth on a loop. Freeze frames with titles, action camera fixes and animated social media posts bring the total number of Elements guides to 67. \nPhotoshop Elements and Premiere Elements retail for a $99 one-time download, or $150 for both programs. Elements Organizer is included with both Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements. Users of previous Elements programs can upgrade for $80 each or $120 combined.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "premiere elements", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google photos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adobe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "photoshop elements and premiere elements", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T17:11:29.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fca1fb41dc4231d85a5d33504929c2ee69701909", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8Ahc6kdmyme_k7o1bWs49dYhDBg28vAHyXypRGFST8IxXfExw.3W2N4JC", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Web\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Puerto Rico website is keeping track of the island\u2019s re-emerging infrastructure", "title_full": "Puerto Rico website is keeping track of the island\u2019s re-emerging infrastructure", "published": "2017-10-04T14:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/puerto-rico-faces-extensive-damage-after-hurricane-maria-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 21, "comments": 0, "shares": 21}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 5}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fca1fb41dc4231d85a5d33504929c2ee69701909", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8Ahc6kdmyme_k7o1bWs49dYhDBg28vAHyXypRGFST8IxXfExw.3W2N4JC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jenny McGrath", "published": "2017-10-04T14:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Puerto Rico website is keeping track of the island\u2019s re-emerging infrastructure", "text": "Home > Home > Puerto Rico website is keeping track of the\u2026 Puerto Rico website is keeping track of the island\u2019s re-emerging infrastructure   Puerto Rico's road to recovery will be going on long after it's out of the headlines, and this website can help people keep track of the status of its infrastructure. \nEarly on September 20, Category 4 Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, taking roofs off houses and doors off their hinges. The storm brought down radar, weather stations, and cell phone towers. It left the island without power . Almost two weeks later, the majority of the residents still don\u2019t have power. In fact, less than 7 percent of customers of Electric Power Authority (AEE), the U.S. territory\u2019s main utility provider, have electricity. That\u2019s up from 5 percent on September 29, according to the Washington Post . \nThe Puerto Rican government set up a website, status.pr , that lets residents check how many gas stations are open and the number of hospitals that are up and running. So at least, the 40 percent of those with internet or cell service can check it, provided they also have access to some electricity. 88 percent of cell sites weren\u2019t yet working as of Monday, according to the Federal Communication Commission. \nThe site went live on September 29, and it shows the small signs of progress that are happening on the island. The number of supermarkets that are now open has risen from 49 percent to 65 percent in the past few days, and 814 of the island\u2019s 1,100 gas stations are operating. There are fewer people and pets taking refuge in shelters. Some stores and hospitals are running on generators, and Tesla sent over some of its Powerwall batteries and is helping to repair solar panels. \nWhile the numbers are important, they don\u2019t tell the whole story. With the electrical grid down in so many places, only 27 percent \u2014 315 \u2014 of the island\u2019s ATMs are able to dispense money. There are long lines of people waiting to get cash, so they can buy supplies, and people are only allowed to take out $40 at a time , CNN reports. \nMeanwhile, some regions are having a harder time getting pallets of food and water delivered, due to impassable roads or destroyed bridges. Almost half of the island\u2019s 3.4 million people now have running water say government officials, but only one in five households in rural areas are among them. \nThough the numbers on status.pr are slowly creeping up, Governor Ricardo Rossello has said it could take months before electricity is fully restored to Puerto Rico.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ricardo rossello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal communication commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electric power authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T17:38:53.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c84f785204c39640e7f4c26bc167a83316855d60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8Ahcv.8l9kHnM0h3FNJVxW.JzJaurnBkMCzHQU7_JbW4g1A--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/home//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Home\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Protect yourself from fire and flooding with next-gen Roost detection devices", "title_full": "Protect yourself from fire and flooding with next-gen Roost detection devices", "published": "2017-10-04T17:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/detector-slider5-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 79}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c84f785204c39640e7f4c26bc167a83316855d60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8Ahcv.8l9kHnM0h3FNJVxW.JzJaurnBkMCzHQU7_JbW4g1A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lulu Chang", "published": "2017-10-04T17:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Protect yourself from fire and flooding with next-gen Roost detection devices", "text": "Home > Home > Protect yourself from fire and flooding with\u2026 Protect yourself from fire and flooding with next-gen Roost detection devices Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Roost promises improved functionality, which means a safer home for you, with its second generation products. \nWe first introduced you to Roost last summer , the smart device that can help you save money and the planet as well by alerting you to leaks and freezes.

Microsoft calls it \u201cMixed Reality\u201d because it will accommodate both VR headsets, and eventually AR headsets like the HoloLens as well. \nA free Windows 10 update will deliver everyone the software they need on October 17. To dive in, though, you\u2019ll need one of five Windows Mixed Reality headsets, the latest of which Microsoft just announced on October 3 at an event in San Francisco. \nWhat\u2019s this new environment like? We had a chance to explore the final version before it reaches consumers in two weeks. It\u2019s the most intuitive, entertaining, and polished VR implementation yet. Welcome to the Cliff House \nEvery interface is a metaphor. Command lines often mimic the typewriter, desktops look like their namesake, and virtual reality interfaces often look like a comfortable, expensive home. Microsoft\u2019s Windows Mixed Reality, which places you in a clifftop mansion, follows similar interfaces from Oculus and HTC. Nick Mokey/Digital Trends Nick Mokey/Digital Trends Nick Mokey/Digital Trends \nThe real-estate aspirations of every Seattle-dwelling Microsoft designer bleed through the so-called Cliff House, a sprawling, minimalist estate with an open floor plan, exposed rock surfaces, a tree-dotted perimeter, and a killer view of Mt. Rainier. You can scope it out from the patio, which joins a deck, theater and living room as the four main spaces you can hop between. \nThe real-estate aspirations of every Seattle-dwelling Microsoft designer bleed through the so-called Cliff House. \nThe home is too sprawling to navigate by walking in real space, so you\u2019ll need to use one of the two Vive-like controllers to get around. As Jeremy Kaplan described in his earlier hands-on demo, you \u201chop\u201d by pushing an analog joystick forward in the direction you want to go, casting a glowing circle on the floor. When you click the trigger, you\u2019ll almost instantly warp there. A number of games already use this trick to avoid the nausea induced by sliding through VR spaces, and Microsoft has wisely decided against reinventing the wheel. \nYou can turn by looking around or, if you\u2019d like to pull an about-face, swivel by pointing the joystick sideways. It moves in notchy increments to, again, prevent you from spewing your guts over the Cliff House\u2019s pristine marble floors. \nAll this might sound complicated. Thankfully, Cortana explains the controls in a quick tutorial. The control scheme felt familiar to me in minutes, and by the end of my demo, I was jackrabbiting through the house like it was second nature. It\u2019s still a desktop \nThe Cliff House, while visually impressive, is mostly a tool for navigating to the good stuff \u2013 apps. There\u2019s no shortage of them. Microsoft claims 20,000 Windows 10 apps will work in virtual reality. Nick Mokey/Digital Trends \nTraditional, two-dimensional apps appear like giant projections on the walls, which you can leap in front of and interact with. Each pistol-shaped controller projects a beam you can swing around like a mouse cursor. Just click the trigger to make a selection, or hold it down to manipulate objects. You can slide an app around on the wall, for instance, or drag the edges to make it bigger or smaller. All the familiar desktop paradigms still work. \nThere are some rough edges, however \u2013 literally. \nThere are moments that\u2019ll have you believe you\u2019re sucking thin mountain air at 8,000 feet. \nVR web browsing isn\u2019t the best. Current VR headsets can\u2019t display smooth, small text easily, so everything must be made jumbo sized, like your grandpa\u2019s calculator. You can view webpages, but it loads the mobile version of sites like Digital Trends, and magnifies them until they look like posters. Even at that resolution, text has a jaggy, uneven look that gets worse toward the edge of your vision. \nEntering text, like web addresses, means pulling down a keyboard the size of a (virtual) piano and punching in every letter with your laser cursor. It\u2019s not as daunting as it sounds, but you wouldn\u2019t want to punch in anything longer than a few words. Microsoft\u2019s VR guru Alex Kipman claims he regularly works in VR and simply dictates to Cortana or touch types with a keyboard, but you\u2019ll need a private office, or a lot of patience, to make it work. Another dimension \nOf course, sticking to 2D apps is like installing Windows and then using the Command interface. You\u2019re here to dive into 3D, right? Microsoft doesn\u2019t disappoint, with an array of 3D experiences from games to 360-degree videos. \nI indulged in a \u201c HoloTour \u201d of Machu Picchu that situated me in a glass-floored hot air balloon drifting above the ancient Incan city. This wasn\u2019t just 360-degree video; Microsoft used stereoscopic cameras that give world depth. There are moments that\u2019ll have you believe you\u2019re sucking thin mountain air at 8,000 feet. Don\u2019t cancel your tickets to Peru just yet, but this might be the Space Cadet 3D Pinball of Windows MR \u2014 a basic, yet impressive forebear of things to come. Nick Mokey/Digital Trends \nMicrosoft has other tricks, too. A Hologram app lets you populate your virtual Cliff House with everything from lamps to rambunctious chameleons on bicycles, which proceed to pedal around like wind-up toys after you set them loose. \nWhere\u2019s MS Paint? Missing, currently \u2014 but everything on Steam will soon work for Windows MR, so Tilt Brush isn\u2019t out of reach. \nThat means games, too. Microsoft showed off Superhot , an existing VR hit, alongside Halo: Recruit , an upcoming VR-only entry in the Halo franchise. Swallow your high expectations now, because the demo I saw was merely a carnival-style shooting gallery plastered over with Halo graphics and narration. We\u2019re told the full game will beyond this training exercise, but if initial impressions are any indication, it\u2019s not going to impress fans waiting for Halo 6 . \nWindows Mixed Reality is the first attempt at building a version of Windows you can live in. \nWe were more impressed by two new, unique games \u2014 Luna , and Sky Worlds . The first is a trippy, calming puzzle game so gorgeous you almost don\u2019t want to solve the simple puzzles, which ask you to move stars into constellation-like formations. Sky Worlds , meanwhile, mimicks classic Warcraft with a 3D game board of medieval warriors clashing in front of you. You can spin it around like a Lazy Susan to get a better look, and pluck cards from your left hand to lay down on the board, where they come to life and go into battle against the marauding horde. \nIf all this sounds like just a little bit too much work, you can also retreat to the home theater room, where a screen that simulates the size of a 300-inch TV awaits. Like the browser, it won\u2019t be as good as your home TV, but if you don a headset on a flight \u2013 and a laptop can definitely power these things \u2013 I guarantee you\u2019ll prefer it to watching on a seat-back screen. A glimpse at the future \nWe\u2019ve long had 3D demos, games, and apps, but Windows Mixed Reality is the first attempt at a VR environment you can actually live in. When you\u2019re not busy blasting aliens, or exploring ancient ruins, or solving 3D puzzles, you can browse the internet, watch movies, and mess around in a space that puts \u2013 I imagine \u2013 even Bill Gates\u2019 house to shame. You could conceivably spend a whole day in here. Instead of an isolated VR experience, Windows Mixed Reality is a virtual reality world. \nI say virtual reality, not mixed reality, because, frankly, that\u2019s PR spin right now. As we said the last time we saw Windows Mixed Reality, there\u2019s nothing mixed about it. Still, we\u2019re looking at Windows Virtual Reality. Microsoft has clearly settled on \u201cmixed reality\u201d as a conveniently ambiguous word that encompasses what HoloLens does, and what VR headsets do. Someday, perhaps, the hardware for both will look similar \u2013 but not yet. \nWindows Mixed Reality is the first version of Windows you can live in. Whether you\u2019ll want to live with it is still another matter, and one that may take several months to know \u2013 but first impressions, at least, are promising.

The Spectre 13 is a thin and light clamshell notebook that we found to be typical of its class \u2014 very thin and well-built with some compromises in performance and battery life. The Spectre x360 13 is a machine we called one of the best Windows 10 2-in-1s you can buy. Now, HP has revamped both of these Spectre machines to bring even more of what makes them such solid machines. HP Spectre 13 \nThe 2017 refresh of the Spectre 13 brings an entirely new design that seeks to shrink the notebook\u2019s overall size without compromising on performance or battery life. First, HP maintained the machine\u2019s 10.4mm thickness but added in a touch display \u2014 leading the company to characterize the Spectre 13 as the \u201cworld\u2019s thinnest touchscreen notebook.\u201d In addition, HP now offers a 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) resolution display in the same thin chassis. Weight went up ever so slightly from 2.43 pounds to 2.45 pounds. \nSecond, the bezels have been made considerably smaller, specifically 9.7mm (40 thinner) on top and 5.3mm (65 percent thinner) on the sides. The bottom bezel is 0.5mm thicker. Even with the reduction in the size of the top bezel, the webcam and the new infrared camera for Windows Hello support remain on top of the display. That results in the new Spectre 13 being 308.2 mm x 224.2 mm, compared to last year\u2019s model, which was 325 mm x 229 mm. \nThe keyboard deck and speakers have also been redesigned, with the dual speakers now positioned directly below the display as opposed to on each side of the keyboard. That has allowed HP to expand the backlit keyboard \u2014 which offers a significant 1.3mm travel \u2014 to include the page up, page down, home, and other keys along the right side as it has done with some other recent machines. The touchpad has been increased in size 15 percent from the previous model. \nIn terms of performance, the new Spectre 13 incorporates the latest eighth-generation quad-core Intel Core i5 and i7 CPUs. Up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM can now be configured, and the solid-state disk (SSD) technology has been migrated to the faster PCIe standard with up to 1TB capacity. \nBattery capacity has been increased from 42 watt-hours to 43.7 watt-hours, which combined with the more efficient processors promises improved battery life with the Full HD display option. The company\u2019s fast-charging technology has also been added, which can charge the battery from zero to 50 percent in 30 minutes. \nFurthermore, HP uses thermal sensors in the Spectre 13 to monitor heat more closely and to engage the fans only when necessary, while the cooling system\u2019s overall design has also been enhanced. All of that promises better control of heat without the need to run the fans as often as with the previous model. \nThe Spectre 13 also offers new color options, including Ceramic White with Pale Gold accents and the company\u2019s trademark Dark Ash Silver with Copper Luxe accents for the cover and keyboard deck. Advanced Electro Deposition (AED) technology is used to create a stronger and more scratch-resistant finish. Carbon fiber is used on the bottom of the chassis to afford weight and heat advantages without compromising strength. The white version comes with a matching white power adapter. \nFinally, the Spectre 13 comes equipped with a total of three USB Type-C ports. Two are fully Thunderbolt 3 certified , while the other is a USB 3.1 Type-C connection. A combo audio jack, 2\u00d72 MU-MIMO and Bluetooth 4.2 round out connectivity. \nHP is pricing the new Spectre 13 at $1,300 for the Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Full HD configuration, with the same configuration and a Core i7 processor being priced at $1,400. Availability has not yet been announced. \nHere are the complete specifications for the new Spectre 13: Screen size:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ceramic white", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dark ash silver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intel core", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T20:13:12.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1667041df98c0c50d514d8e1e77cba4961a6e707", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXBxQk5RHofcyQAO5VBw5qo8HJr8cwbhGug-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to Fix the 26 Most Common iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 Problems | Digital Trends", "title_full": "How to Fix the 26 Most Common iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 Problems | Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-04T13:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.154, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/apple-iphone-6-plus-review-screen-angle-2-2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg?ver=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 43, "comments": 0, "shares": 43}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 100}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1667041df98c0c50d514d8e1e77cba4961a6e707", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXBxQk5RHofcyQAO5VBw5qo8HJr8cwbhGug-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Simon Hill", "published": "2017-10-04T13:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Fix the 26 Most Common iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 Problems | Digital Trends", "text": "How to factory reset an iPhone 7 (and every other iPhone) \nApple finally went big with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, bowing to peer pressure and outfitting its iconic phones with a larger touchscreen. The svelte iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have sold like hotcakes in the time since their debut in late-2014, even since the release of the next-gen iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Plenty of people have enjoyed their iPhone 6, but, sadly, many problems have arisen over the years. If you\u2019ve run into any iPhone 6 problems, then you might find the answer you need right here. Problem: iPhone shuts down on its own, or awful battery life \nIn 2016, Apple started a free battery-replacement program for iPhone 6S units that would shut down unexpectedly. People had complained that their iPhones would just turn off if they dipped below 30 percent battery life. \nApple hasn\u2019t announced any such recall for the iPhone 6, but an increasing number of people have been complaining about their iPhone 6 smartphones shutting down on their own after dipping below 40 percent. Others have complained about very bad battery life. \nPotential solutions: If you\u2019re experiencing bad battery life, we recommend that you follow our iPhone battery tips to make your iPhone battery last longer. If you\u2019re one of the unlucky owners of an iPhone 6 who is experiencing shutdowns, we are sorry to say that there is no replacement program for the iPhone 6, as there is for the iPhone 6S. We recommend that you visit your local Apple retail store or contact Apple directly on the phone. You may have a hardware issue. Battery performance will deteriorate over time, so it may be worth looking into getting a battery replacement. Apple offers a replacement service for $79. Issue: iPhone is slow or lagging \nThere have been a few reports of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets becoming sluggish, particularly after receiving an update. If you find that there are delays when tapping or swiping, or perhaps apps take a few seconds longer to open than they once did, then there are a few things you can try. \nPotential solutions : Begin by restarting your iPhone. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons simultaneously, until you see the Apple logo. If that doesn\u2019t help, then try performing a factory reset and restoring your device from a backup. Glitch: GPS not working \nQuite a few people have run into an issue with the GPS function in the iPhone 6. They might be using Apple Maps, Google Maps, or any other app that employs the GPS, but find that it\u2019s inaccurate or very slow to update. That said, it may still work fine when they\u2019re connected to Wi-Fi. \nPotential solutions : Check in Settings > Privacy > Location Services and make sure Location Services is toggled on at the top. Then, check the rest of the settings and ensure nothing important has been toggled off. If you have a case on your iPhone, then remove it and test the GPS again. You may want to try resetting your network settings via Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings . Keep in mind, however, that you will have to re-enter some passwords and set up your network connections again after this. There\u2019s a chance that your hardware is failing, in which case replacing the antenna or the cable connecting it to the logic board will resolve the issue. This has worked for some people, but not everyone. You could try going into an Apple Store, but the employees may suggest that you buy a new iPhone. Problem: iPhone screen freezes \nSome iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users have found that their device\u2019s display becomes unresponsive when using apps. The problem has been reported on the Apple forums many times, and we\u2019ve seen the same issue reported back in iOS 9.3.1 . The issue has been known to occur multiple times in a single day. \nWorkarounds: Use the lock button to turn the screen off and on again. Hold down the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons until you see the Apple logo appear to reset your iPhone. Factory reset and restore your device as a new phone, or restore it from a backup. \nPotential solutions: If none of the aforementioned workarounds fixes the problem, consider contacting Apple or going to an Apple Store. The problem may be with the hardware, not the software. Problem: Can\u2019t send or receive iMessages and texts \nSome users are struggling with an issue where a contact or multiple contacts are unable to receive iMessages and texts from an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus user, though they can still receive texts from other contacts. Some people are unable to send text messages, and for others , iMessages don\u2019t appear to go through properly. This problem has cropped up in various versions of iOS, including iOS 10. \nPotential solutions: Turn iMessage off and back on, or turn iMessage off to see if texts can be sent and received. Make sure the contact is not on your block list. To do so, go to Settings > Phone > Call Blocking & Identification , and confirm that the user is not on any block list. If you have an old iPhone or another iOS device that you sometimes use for iMessages, try toggling iMessages off there and sign out of your Apple account. You can sign out by going to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive and tapping on your Apple ID, then choose Sign Out . Delete your current conversation with the problem contact(s) and start a new one. Delete and re-enter said contact(s). Simultaneously hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons to reset your device. Try going to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings . You will have to re-enter some passwords and set network connections up again after this. You could try a factory reset of your iPhone . Contact Apple Support, or take your device to an Apple Store to get it checked out. Problem: Unable to update to iOS 11 \nEvery time a new iOS version rolls out, some users have trouble with the update, as discussed on this thread in the Apple forums. \nPotential solutions: If you\u2019re doing an OTA (Over The Air) update through WiFi, you will need around 1.5GB of free storage on your device. If you\u2019re having issues with the OTA update, check out Apple\u2019s over-the-air help page for more information. Make sure that Wi-Fi is on and go to Settings > General > Software Update on your iPhone. If you can\u2019t update directly on your iPhone, then try plugging into your PC or laptop. Make sure you\u2019re using the latest version of iTunes , which is 12.7 at the time of writing. If it doesn\u2019t work, then hold down the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons together on your iPhone 6 while it\u2019s still connected to your computer. Wait until you see the recovery screen \u2014 you should see the Apple logo and then the iTunes icon with the cable. Choose the Update option on your computer when it appears. If met with an error code, check Apple\u2019s detailed support page on what the different error codes mean and what to do. Contact Apple Support, or take your device to an Apple Store.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "apple store", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T20:25:54.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cfe87542845c8e440e74b97a879b2a7a631895bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXDWrZF_IfsnUj3TbUzY7wDK3cjeEXY1NP0-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/apple//feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Apple\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Common iOS 11 problems and how to handle them", "title_full": "Common iOS 11 problems and how to handle them", "published": "2017-10-04T16:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/apple-ios-11-2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 61, "comments": 0, "shares": 61}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cfe87542845c8e440e74b97a879b2a7a631895bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXDWrZF_IfsnUj3TbUzY7wDK3cjeEXY1NP0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brenda Stolyar", "published": "2017-10-04T16:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Common iOS 11 problems and how to handle them", "text": "Best iOS app deals of the day! 6 paid iPhone apps for free for a limited time   \nApple\u2019s latest mobile operating system, iOS 11 , launched on September 19, and early adopters have already reported several crucial bugs. The public and developer betas have been out since June, but it\u2019s clear even the final version isn\u2019t glitch-free. \nWe\u2019ve searched a variety of forums for the biggest problems people are experiencing on their iPhone or iPad since the update. To help make the transition easier for you, here are the most common iOS 11 problems and potential solutions on how to deal with them. Problem: Battery drain \nWith any iOS update also comes battery issues. Being able to handle iOS 11 isn\u2019t a problem for the next-generation iPhone 8 , 8 Plus, and X, which all include an A11 Bionic chip. But for those of you with an older processor, you might find your battery dying more quickly than it used to. On Apple\u2019s forums , multiple users have been complaining that their batteries have been draining extremely fast since downloading iOS 11. \nPotential solutions: If you haven\u2019t updated to iOS 11 yet, you might want to hold off until the issue gets fixed in the next update. But if you did download the latest operating system, you can still downgrade back to iOS 10.3.3 . Find which apps are taking up the most power by going to Settings > Battery power . This will tell you the exact percentage of battery life specific apps used over the last 24 hours and the last seven days. You can then either delete the apps that drain the most power or use them minimally. If you don\u2019t want to delete them, remember to always properly quit apps after you\u2019re fully done using them. If you know you\u2019re going to go back within a short period of time, however, you\u2019re better off leaving them open . According to USA Today , you can check if you have a problem by noting your Usage and Standby time, both under the Battery Power section. If your Usage time has increased by more than a minute, within five minutes of locking and unlocking your phone, then your phone isn\u2019t resting the way it should. For more suggestions on saving battery life, you can check out our iPhone battery tips roundup . Issue: Device overheating \nNot only have users on Apple\u2019s forum been complaining about their devices getting extremely hot, but some claim to have experienced serious swelling causing their iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to burst open. Due to what appears to be the battery swelling from gases inside, the expansion places pressure on the display causing it to pop open. While having the device burst open does help to avoid a fire, you\u2019ll still want to make sure your device doesn\u2019t overheat. \nPotential solutions: If overheating occurs when you\u2019re using a specific app, then take a break from using it. We did notice the iPhone getting very warm when playing AR games, but it should shut down automatically if it ever gets too hot. Turn off Location Services by going to Settings > Privacy > Location Service. Since Location Services uses GPS, Bluetooth, and cell tower locations to determine where you are, this could be too much activity for your phone on top of running demanding apps. You can also turn off the Bluetooth feature by going to Settings > Bluetooth , or swiping up to the Control Center and tapping on the Bluetooth icon. You can also kill any apps running in the background by double-clicking the Home button. This will pull up a gallery of apps that you can swipe through and swipe up to force close. If your iPhone starts to overheat while charging, unplug it and let it sit for a few minutes to cool down. Then, you can plug it back in. Taking your phone case off your device could help too. This will keep the case from trapping the heat and won\u2019t block the phone\u2019s heat vents. Problem: Apps won\u2019t work in iOS 11 \nApple originally warned users with iOS 10.3 that it will soon drop support for 32-bit apps. With iOS 11, the change is official and any 32-bit apps on your phone will refuse to launch. You\u2019ll instead receive a pop-up notification letting you know the developer needs to release a 64-bit update for it to work. \nWorkaround: You can check which of your apps are 32-bit by going to General > Settings > About > Applications. If you do have 32-bit apps then you\u2019ll see an arrow next to the number of applications you have. You can tap on the section to see a list of which apps don\u2019t have updates available. If you get to the Applications tab and tapping on it doesn\u2019t lead to another window, it means you don\u2019t have any 32-bit apps installed. Glitch: Apps freezing or quitting unexpectedly \nA common problem users have been experiencing with iOS 11 is their apps freezing or quitting unexpectedly. The problem could stem from a variety of reasons ranging from the iOS version to the app itself. If you find yourself opening an app only to watch it shut down on you repeatedly, there are ways, other than simply deleting the app, to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. \nPotential solutions: Go to the App Store and tap on the Updates tab. If there\u2019s an update available for the specific app that\u2019s constantly crashing, then you can choose to update only that one or go through with all the updates available. Delete the app and redownload it. By holding down on the app and tapping the X button, you can delete it from your phone completely. Then, head over to the App Store and download the same app again. Once it\u2019s complete, you can try and open it again from the Home screen. There\u2019s also always the option to contact the developer of the app if the issue continues to happen. While under the app in the App Store , find the App Store Customer Reviews section and tap App Support. If you haven\u2019t downloaded iOS 11 yet, make sure you \u201cAgree\u201d to the Terms and Conditions within the App Store after downloading an app. There could be changes in the terms that keep apps from launching which then causes them to crash. Problem: Touchscreen stops working \nWith iOS 11, users on the Apple Forum have been reporting their touchscreen is either lagging or becomes completely unresponsive. The issue has existed as far back as the beta with developers posting on the Apple Developer forum. If you find this happens to you, there\u2019s always the common answer of making sure your screen is both clean and dry, and that you don\u2019t need a new screen protector. But there are also other ways you might fix this issue within the operating system, rather than focusing on the screen itself. \nPotential solutions: Check the 3D Touch Sensitivity bar by going t o Settings > General > Accessibility > 3D Touch . If it\u2019s on the Medium or Firm setting, you\u2019ll want to set it to Light instead. The issue might also happen while using a specific app. In that case, exit out of the app and then force quit it by tapping on the Home Button twice. Once you restart the app, the touchscreen should start working again. If the touchscreen is completely unresponsive then a simple reset will often deal with it. The method is different for different iPhone models, so check out our guide on how to reset your iPhone . Problem: Can\u2019t connect to App Store \nAside from problems downloading apps, some users have also been experiencing problems with getting into the App Store. During the beta testing, Reddit users had the same issue and took to the iOS 11 thread to try to solve it. They\u2019ve been receiving error messages saying their device cannot currently connect to the App Store. \nPotential solutions: Sync the date and time on your device by going to General >Date & Time. Toggle off Set Automatically and instead scroll through to manually set the date and time. This will also change the date and time in the Today tab within the App Store. Then, go to the App Store and leave it open for 3 seconds, go back to Date & Time under settings and toggle on Set Automatically . Then kill the App Store through the app switcher and reopen it again. After syncing the date and time, you can also restart your device. If you\u2019re using an iPhone 6S or earlier model, press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons together until you see the Apple logo on screen. For the iPhone 7, and later, press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Volume down buttons. You can also try to enable Mobile Data by going to Settings > Cellular > Enable Cellular Data . Once you scroll down to App Store, toggle it on. Bug: Can\u2019t send emails with Outlook.com or Exchange mail account \nWhen the official version of iOS 11 first launched, users were receiving an error message when they tried to send an email. The problem occurred specifically with email accounts hosted by Microsoft, Office 365 , or Outlook.com . When they would try to send an email, it would tell them \u201cthe message was rejected by the server.\u201d If you\u2019re on iOS 11, you could still be receiving this message when attempting to send an email. \nSolution: Only a week after iOS 11 was released, Apple rolled out its beta version of iOS 11.1 which should now be available on your device to download. You can check on your iPhone by going to Settings > General > Software Update for an update option. Apple announced on its forum that the latest version has fixed the bug and you should no longer have problems sending out emails through any of those hosts. Glitch: Brightness is turned up but your device is still dim \nOne user on an iOS 11 Reddit thread noticed their iPhone 7 looked dimmer than it did on iOS 10, even though the brightness is turned up. The new operating system might reset your settings from iOS 10, causing it to also reset the White Point percentage \u2014 which reduces the intensity of bright colors. \nSolution: Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations . You\u2019ll see Reduce White Point at the bottom of the section, which you can either lower the percentage of, to make it brighter, or toggle the feature off. Problem: Trouble connecting to Wi-Fi \nUsers have expressed via the Apple Forum that they are losing Wi-Fi connection or are unable to connect to networks. Even though the Wi-Fi is working with other devices, people are having trouble finding a stable connection. \nPotential solution: Before attempting to figure out the bug on your iPhone, make sure your router is on and within range. You should also make sure you can see your Wi-Fi network by going to Settings > Wi-Fi and check that you\u2019re connected to the correct network. You can also try and restart both your iOS device, the router, cable, or DSL modem \u2014 by unplugging it and then plugging it back in. If you still can\u2019t connect go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings . This will reset Wi-Fi networks and passwords, along with cellular, VPN, and APN settings. \nIf iOS 11 is still giving you trouble, you can always reset your iPhone to its factory settings by going to Settings > General > Reset and tap Erase All Content and Settings . Just make sure that you back up all your precious files first as this will wipe your iPhone completely.

But not all Uber employees agreed with that decision, and Kalanick himself is reportedly vying for ways to retake the reins at the company. According to a report from The Information , the former CEO asked some of Uber\u2019s earliest employees (those still at the company) to support him in a potential shareholder battle. This could signal an ongoing battle over Uber\u2019s rather murky future, at least insofar as leadership is concerned. \nHowever, it looks as though Kalanick will have a tougher time now reestablishing himself at the top of the company. On Tuesday, October 3, Uber\u2019s board of directors voted for governance changes that are said to \u201creshape the balance of power\u201d and \u201c[pave] the way for\u2026the company to go public by 2019,\u201d as per a New York Times report . As part of that power adjustment, the influence of board members \u2014 including Kalanick \u2014 will be reduced, allowing the company to move forward with an investment from Japanese conglomerate Softbank, and perhaps an IPO. \nThis latest power play comes a few months after drama involving Uber investor Benchmark Capital, which sued Kalanick for fraud. As a result of this litigation, another group of investors asked Benchmark to divest its Uber shares and get off the board. \nBenchmark decided to sue Kalanick after the former exec attempted to create three new seats on the board (one of which he would occupy). But Benchmark wanted Kalanick completely removed from the company. \nOther investors, however, were incensed by this attempt. In an email obtained by Axios , three investors \u2014 Shervin Pishevar, Ron Burkle of Yucaipa, and Adam Leber of Maverick \u2014 called Benchmark\u2019s lawsuit \u201cethically dubious and, critically, value-destructive rather than value enhancing.\u201d Noting that the case would be \u201cfratricidal,\u201d the three individual investors said that the move could \u201ccost the company public goodwill, interfere with fundraising, and impede the critical search for a new, world-class Chief Executive Officer.\u201d \nKalanick himself has responded to the lawsuit in legal filings , claiming that Benchmark\u2019s lawsuit is \u201cpart of its public and personal attack\u201d on him. As initially reported by Axios , Kalanick also accused the venture capital firm of taking advantage of him as he was mourning his mother\u2019s death. \u201c[Benchmark] executed its plan at the most shameful of times: immediately after Kalanick experienced a horrible personal tragedy,\u201d court documents read. Ultimately, the embattled former executive claims that Benchmark\u2019s accusations of fraud are based upon \u201cinformation and belief\u201d instead of real proof. \nUber\u2019s board recently signed off on new rules that forbade current board members from contacting current Uber employees for information or assistance unless given express permission from the board. The Information reported that this decision \u201cwas triggered by Mr. Kalanick\u2019s discussions with former colleagues that alarmed some employees, a person familiar with the matter said.\u201d \nNews of the 40-year-old founder\u2019s departure from the company followed mounting criticism over the way the company has been conducting its business. In a statement seen by the Times, Kalanick said: \u201cI love Uber more than anything in the world, and at this difficult moment in my personal life, I have accepted the investors\u2019 request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight.\u201d \nAccording to reports, Kalanick\u2019s decision followed a revolt among shareholders who told him that new leadership was required for the company to move forward. \nKalanick, who founded Uber in 2009, reportedly received the demand by letter while in Chicago. After several hours of discussions, he finally agreed to leave the top job. \nWhile Uber has always faced plenty of criticism about how it conducts its business, matters appeared to take a turn for the worse earlier this year when a former employee made allegations of a company culture where sexual harassment and gender discrimination was rife. \nBesides concerns about its workplace culture, the company is also embroiled in a legal battle with Google spinoff Waymo over the alleged theft of autonomous-car tech. It\u2019s also facing a probe by the Department of Justice following accusations that it used secret technology to hide its vehicles from officials in some cities where attempts were being made to cut down on the service. \nUber\u2019s investors hope new leadership will set the company on a steadier course free of controversy, but even the decision to force out Kalanick has proven controversial. As originally reported by Recode , Uber employees circulated a petition asking the company\u2019s board to keep Kalanick on in some capacity; it garnered more than 1,000 signatures. \nUpdate: Travis Kalanick will find it harder to regain power at Uber following governance changes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "travis kalanick", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shervin pishevar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalanick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ron burkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam leber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waymo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "axios", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "softbank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yucaipa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benchmark capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kalanick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T22:52:07.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b59feac54311bf9e31dbb69b4c552ad668c6d387", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXARolUaXnfhftNbndYIYeFSYXCw9X5ES_f6.g5CvE2mt_QIOVuFVp_LAojejqRGIXY-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.topix.com/rss/wire/gadgets/cameras", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Google Pixel 2 XL vs. Apple iPhone X: There can be only one", "title_full": "Google Pixel 2 XL vs. Apple iPhone X: There can be only one", "published": "2017-10-04T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/google-pixel-2-feature-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 115, "comments": 14, "shares": 115}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 10}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b59feac54311bf9e31dbb69b4c552ad668c6d387", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXARolUaXnfhftNbndYIYeFSYXCw9X5ES_f6.g5CvE2mt_QIOVuFVp_LAojejqRGIXY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Pixel 2 XL vs. Apple iPhone X: There can be only one", "text": "Hands-on review Coming soon \nThese are two of the fastest and most powerful phones you can find, but there is a significant gap on the performance front. Apple\u2019s custom-designed A11 Bionic chip packs six cores \u2014 two for high performance and four for high efficiency \u2014 as well as a graphics processing unit that is 30 percent faster than the one in last year\u2019s iPhone 7. That enormous processing power is put to good use with cutting-edge augmented reality support, and the new FaceID technology, which allows you to unlock your iPhone simply by holding it up to your face. \nBy contrast, the Pixel 2 XL has Qualcomm\u2019s octa-core Snapdragon 835 processor paired with an Adreno 540 GPU. We know this combo well because it is featured in a range of the top Android smartphones over the last few months, from Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S8 to the HTC U11 . Google\u2019s new phone is likely to squeeze the best performance from this hardware, because it runs stock Android, with no embellishments, but it\u2019s not going to keep up with the iPhone X. Last year\u2019s A10 chip, which Apple employed in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, beat the Snapdragon 835 in most benchmarks and the new A11 is a lot faster . \nThe fact that the Pixel XL 2 has 4GB of RAM to the iPhone X\u2019s 3GB of RAM, is not going to improve things for Google\u2019s phone because Android and iOS handle memory management in very different ways and so the iPhone simply doesn\u2019t need as much RAM for comparable performance. \nBoth phones offer 64GB in the basic model, or you can pay more to jump up to 256GB with the iPhone X, or 128GB with the Pixel 2 XL. Neither offers a MicroSD card slot for expansion. \nWe don\u2019t think you\u2019ll really feel the difference in everyday use now \u2014 both these phones are plenty fast and powerful enough \u2014 but there\u2019s no doubt that the iPhone X has more raw power and that will likely tell over time as these handsets age. \nWinner: iPhone X Display, design, and durability Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends \nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 2 XL is a big phone by any measure, but the manufacturer, LG, had some practice shrinking bezels and fitting gorgeous OLED screens, most recently in the LG V30 . The two-tone design on the aluminum back, which we saw in the original Pixel phones, has been retained in the Pixel 2 XL, but this time the signature glass portion at the top has shrunk in size and the fingerprint sensor sits below it. The main camera is at the top left corner, flanked by the flash. Flipping it back over, there is a power button on the right spine, highlighted in orange, with a volume rocker slightly further down. \nThe 6-inch display dominates the front of the phone and it is one of the sharpest displays we have ever seen with a resolution of 2,880 x 1,440 pixels, giving it a pixel-per-inch score of 538. Thin bezels top and bottom house the front-facing stereo speakers, microphone, front-facing camera, and a few other sensors. The Pixel 2 XL is significantly taller and a touch wider than the iPhone X, but they weigh about the same. \nThe iPhone X marks a real change of direction for Apple by embracing the bezel-less trend and adopting OLED screen technology. While the notch that eats into the top of the display has garnered some negative reactions, most people agree that the iPhone X looks stunning and futuristic. A svelte, steel frame gives way to a glass back, which allows the iPhone X to support wireless charging. The dual camera module is stacked vertically, unlike the 8 Plus. Overall, it\u2019s a beautiful device that reflects Apple\u2019s minimalist approach to design. \nThe notch is a necessary evil, as it houses the front-facing camera, FaceID tech, speaker, microphone, and some other sensors. There is no room for a fingerprint sensor, but the almost all-screen front allows Apple to pack a 5.8-inch screen into a relatively compact body. The OLED screen is the sharpest Apple has ever put in a smartphone, with a resolution of 2,436 x 1,125 pixels, giving it a pixel-per-inch score of 458. \nOn the durability front, Apple\u2019s iPhone X and Google\u2019s Pixel 2 XL boast an IP67 rating, which means they can be dunked at a depth of up to one meter for 30 minutes without sustaining any damage. Neither of these phones has a 3.5mm audio jack, so you\u2019re stuck with adapters or Bluetooth 5. \nWhile the Pixel 2 XL has a slightly bigger and sharper display, the iPhone X is smaller and more stylish. The design of the iPhone X is a real leap for Apple, while the Pixel 2 XL feels like an evolutionary step for Google. The iPhone X edges the win in this one. \nWinner: iPhone X Battery life and charging \nThe Pixel 2 XL is packing a sizable battery rated at 3,520 mAh. That is a touch bigger than last year\u2019s Pixel XL , which we found fairly average in the battery department. We expect the Pixel 2 XL to last at least a full day between charges, maybe longer. The iPhone X has a much smaller, 2,716 mAh battery. It has a slightly smaller screen to power and there may be efficiency benefits from that A11 chip, but we fully expect it to be in the daily charging category. We\u2019ll have to test them out in the wild to be sure, but you\u2019d expect to get more battery life from the Pixel 2 XL based on the specs. \nAs for charging, the iPhone X can charge 50 percent in 30 minutes. The Pixel 2 XL supports fast charging, too, with a 15-minute charge providing up to 7 hours of battery life. \nThe iPhone X also supports wireless charging via the Qi standard, which is very handy if you have wireless phone chargers . Sadly, the Pixel 2 XL doesn\u2019t support wireless charging, but it still wins this category for the larger battery capacity. \nWinner: Pixel 2 XL Cameras \nGoogle continues to ignore the dual camera trend with the Pixel 2 XL, which has a single camera sensor rated at 12.2 megapixels with an f/1.8 aperture. The original Pixel proved that a well-designed single lens camera with clever software can go toe-to-toe with any dual-lens setup, and the hardware in the Pixel 2 XL has been improved. DxOMark has scored it at 98 , the highest score of any smartphone camera so far. For comparison, the second place phones right now are the iPhone 8 Plus and Galaxy Note 8 on 94. Google added optical image stabilization and made some software tweaks to improve the overall experience. The Pixel 2 XL also offers a portrait photo mode, on both the front-facing and rear cameras, like the iPhone X, though it works differently. The fact that Google provides free, unlimited cloud storage for all your photos and videos in high resolution is a valuable extra. \nApple\u2019s iPhone X camera sports dual 12-megapixel sensors, combining wide-angle and telephoto lenses, with f/1.8 and f/2.4 apertures, respectively. Both have optical image stabilization, to help prevent blurry shots. You can take unique portrait shots and tweak the light source with the Portrait Lighting feature . There is also a powerful bokeh effect, to blur backgrounds, and 2x optical zoom. The front-facing camera boasts Apple\u2019s True Depth system, employing an infrared camera that works together with the 7-megapixel front-facing camera to securely recognize your face and unlock your phone. It can also be used to animate emojis with your own facial expressions, something Apple calls Animoji . \nOn the video front, Apple\u2019s camera can shoot 4K at 60 frames per second and 1080p at 240 fps. By contrast, the Pixel 2 XL tops out at 30 fps for 4K and 120 fps for 1080p footage. \nWe want some hands-on time with these cameras before we declare an overall winner. \nWinner: Tie Software Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends \nBoth Android and iOS are polished, feature-packed platforms that have much more in common than divides them. You can get all the major apps and games on both. Familiarity is probably going to dictate your preference. Google\u2019s Pixel 2 XL runs the latest Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box and will get updates just as soon as they come out, which is more than you can say for a lot of other Android flagships. This is Google\u2019s vision of how Android should be, and it\u2019s every bit as slick and stylish as Apple\u2019s iOS. The iPhone X also runs the latest version of Apple\u2019s platform, iOS 11 , and it will get updates as soon as they\u2019re released for the foreseeable future. \nThe iPhone X has a handful of nifty features connected to the front-facing cameras, which we have already discussed. But the Pixel 2 XL offers Active Edge, which allows you to squeeze your phone to launch Google Assistant or snap a selfie, like HTC\u2019s Edge Sense on the U11. Both Google and Apple are highlighting augmented reality, with a range of fun games that play out on top of your coffee table, and handy apps that can help you preview furniture in your living room. The best ARKit apps are well worth a look for iPhone owners, but Google is doing something similar with ARCore . Google also has Daydream VR , whereas Apple has yet to jump on board with virtual reality. \nBoth platforms are great. We can\u2019t award a winner in this category. \nWinner: Tie Pricing and availability \nNeither of these phones is available yet. The iPhone X is available for pre-order from October 27 and will begin shipping on November 3. The Pixel 2 XL is available for pre-order now and should start shipping on October 17. \nThe iPhone X starts at a whopping $1,000 for the 64GB model, while the 256GB variety will cost you an extra $150. It will also be available on contract from all the major carriers, including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint and you can expect to pay close to $50 per month if you opt for the 64GB model on a 24-month contract. Check out our iPhone X buying guide for all the details. \nThe Pixel 2 XL starts at $850 and Google is offering a Home Mini speaker, which usually costs $50, for free with every purchase for a limited time. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a Verizon exclusive, but you can buy it unlocked and use it with your preferred carrier. Check out our Pixel 2 XL buying guide for all the details. \nWinner: Pixel 2 XL Overall winner: Apple iPhone X \nIf the iPhone X price tag gives you pause, or you prefer Android, then the Pixel 2 XL may prove irresistible. It has a gorgeous, big display, an excellent camera, and some slick software extras. Google\u2019s latest and greatest looks fantastic and we can\u2019t wait to spend more time with it, but Apple\u2019s iPhone X edges the overall win.

It\u2019s available in preview on the Google Pixel , Pixel XL , and Samsung Galaxy S8 ahead of a launch on phones from LG, Asus, and Huawei. But that\u2019s just the start. At an October 4 event in San Francisco, Google announced a slew of ARCore updates pegged for the holiday season. \nOne of the highlights is AR Stickers, a Google-designed app launching in preview alongside the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL . Using ARCore\u2019s environment-scanning algorithms, the app overlays digital decorations on surfaces like floors, tables, walls, and chairs. Google demoed a few inspired by the hit Netflix series Stranger Things at the event in San Francisco, and said it\u2019s teaming up with brands like Disney, the NBA, NBC, Netflix, and others for the first few sticker packs. \nThe other new ARCore apps are less exclusive \u2014 Google says they\u2019ll work on \u201cmost\u201d Android devices running 7.0 Nougat or newer. A new League of Legends app lets spectators watch matches unfold in their living rooms. An updated Lego app puts hundreds of digital kits and pieces at your fingertips. (Google showed a Lego astronaut zooming around in a spaceship.) And a shopping app from Houzz lets you pick, personalize, customize, and \u201cplace\u201d furniture before you order it. \nThe Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are uniquely optimized for ARCore, Clay Bavor, Google\u2019s vice president of AR and VR, said . Thanks to high-fidelity gyroscopes and accelerometers, top-end cameras, and powerful image processors, they\u2019re able to run most ARCore apps at a consistent 60 frames per second \u2014 a smoother image than you\u2019re likely to get on less powerful devices. \nGoogle said that ARCore focuses on three critical elements \u2014 motion tracking, environmental understanding, and lighting. It determines a device\u2019s position and orientation in space by anchoring onto specific \u201clandmarks\u201d\u2014 furniture, for example \u2014 in a room, and adjusts for factors like ambient lighting. It\u2019s not unlike Project Tango, the Google-designed depth-sensing platform built into LG\u2019s Phab 2 Pro and Asus\u2019s ZenFone AR . But Google sees the two technologies as complementary. \n\u201cWe think of Tango more and more as an enabling technology \u2014 it\u2019s akin to GPS, where you don\u2019t see devices or apps branded as having this technical capability,\u201d Google told us. \u201c[The public] may not see consumer-branded Tango devices moving forward .\u201d \nThe new ARCore-enabled apps will be available from Google\u2019s AR Experiments showcase and the Google Play Store when they launch later this year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "houzz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clay bavor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ar stickers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "android army", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google pixel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google play store", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arcore", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T23:24:00.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a86eeb76bdc5470393b8d7bf111331255459a116", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeKhtzpYY8aCnj0a44wqNDwIG5kuzwz7nlU.kTVqJKEz17dzpfxdI1qg-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Researchers are measuring ocean health with drones, A.I., and whale snot", "title_full": "Researchers are measuring ocean health with drones, A.I., and whale snot", "published": "2017-10-04T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.19, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/1-snot-bot-1-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 36, "comments": 0, "shares": 36}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 30}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a86eeb76bdc5470393b8d7bf111331255459a116", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeKhtzpYY8aCnj0a44wqNDwIG5kuzwz7nlU.kTVqJKEz17dzpfxdI1qg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hillary Grigonis", "published": "2017-10-04T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Researchers are measuring ocean health with drones, A.I., and whale snot", "text": "Home > Emerging Tech > Researchers are measuring ocean health with\u2026 Researchers are measuring ocean health with drones, A.I., and whale snot Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Gathering health data about ocean and Arctic creatures should help scientists better understand the impact of climate change. \nHow do you determine the health of the oceans and the Arctic? With some drones, artificial intelligence, and a bit of whale snot. On World Animal Day, Wednesday, October 4, Intel shared how its technology is being used as part of two successful wildlife research projects involving camera drones and artificial intelligence. The company recently partnered with a wildlife photographer, a conservationist, and two non-profit organizations to study the health of polar bears and whales, both animals that offer clues to the health of their ecosystems and the impact of climate change . \nIn the first study, wildlife photographer Ole Jorgen Liodden used Intel\u2019s Falcon 8 drone system and a thermal camera to study the habits of a group of polar bears. With the drone\u2019s aerial views, Liodden was able to monitor behavior like feeding, breeding, and migration. The data, Intel says, will help scientists understand how the animals are impacted by climate change, which offers a glimpse of the health of the arctic ecosystem as a whole. \nTraditionally, researchers would have studied the bears\u2019 movements using helicopters, a method that\u2019s both expensive and invasive to the bears, or boats, a scenario that\u2019s dangerous for researchers because of the harsh conditions. Using the drone, the polar bears did not appear to be affected by its noise or appearance, even when the UAV was flown between 50 and 100 meters away. \n\u201cPolar bears are a symbol of the Arctic. They are strong, intelligent animals,\u201d Liodden said. \u201cIf they become extinct, there will be challenges with our entire ecosystem. Drone technology can hopefully help us get ahead of these challenges to better understand our world and preserve the earth\u2019s environment.\u201d \nThe second research project is offering a better understanding of the health of the oceans by looking at, yes, whale snot. Accurately dubbed Project SnotBot , Intel partnered with Parley for the Oceans and Ocean Alliance to use artificial intelligence to monitor a whale\u2019s health in real time. SnotBots first started studying the whales earlier this year. \nAfter collecting the spout water from several different breeds of whales, including blue whales, right whales, gray whales, humpback whales and orcas, Intel\u2019s AI algorithms analyze the sample for several different elements. The whale snot contains a wealth of different information, including stress and pregnancy hormones, viruses, bacteria, toxins, and DNA. The machine learning technology, Intel says, allows researchers to access the data in real time in order to make more timely decisions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T23:28:35.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6d201d2fc07412fb5ab50bee4a3f4932d8e5e56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBTgmo8Y5p_1NxLGC68IB4PTXw1wEo1IlRA62SrXldppGOlCYTlEPLDyBKHhxhacrYWX0y91ehbS2SR3fDS4v2NxYMUDKQcZFf", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why \u2018Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins\u2019 setting is its best quality | Digital Trends", "title_full": "Why \u2018Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins\u2019 setting is its best quality | Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.221, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/aco_screen_tombstellae_previews_1506632376-feat-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 16, "comments": 0, "shares": 16}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6d201d2fc07412fb5ab50bee4a3f4932d8e5e56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBTgmo8Y5p_1NxLGC68IB4PTXw1wEo1IlRA62SrXldppGOlCYTlEPLDyBKHhxhacrYWX0y91ehbS2SR3fDS4v2NxYMUDKQcZFf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Phil Hornshaw", "published": "2017-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why \u2018Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins\u2019 setting is its best quality | Digital Trends", "text": "Share \nA ssassin\u2019s Creed is one of the few AAA game series that bothers to engage with history. For each installment of the franchise, Ubisoft meticulously researches the historical settings it seeks to depict, finding ways to artfully inject its overarching fiction \u2014 the ancient and ongoing power struggle between the Assassins and Knights Templar \u2014 into gaps of the history we know. Seeing how the team weaves those threads together has always been one of the series\u2019 highlights. \nAssassin\u2019s Creed: Origins , the tenth chapter of Ubisoft\u2019s signature franchise, might have the series\u2019 most interesting setting yet, dialing the franchise\u2019s clock back to Egypt, circa 49 B.C.E. \u2014 Cleopatra has been deposed , Caesar and the Roman Empire is drawing near, and much of human civilization is in a state of flux and change. \nThat\u2019s more than 1,000 years further back than any Assassin\u2019s Creed has ever gone (specifically, 1,000 years before the original game, which was set in Jerusalem and the surrounding area during the Crusades). It\u2019s also a key moment in the fiction of the franchise: The birth of the Assassin Brotherhood. Ubisoft Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise through the ages: Assassin\u2019s Creed and Assassin\u2019s Creed : Revelations (top), Assassin\u2019s Creed III and Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins (bottom) \n\u201cWe knew that we were planning a game over a thousand years before AC1 , so we felt it was an opportunity to tell, within our lore, the story of the birth of this group of people who\u2019ve lasted over 2,000 years in the lore,\u201d Ashraf Ismail , Origins \u2019 game director, told Digital Trends at a preview event in September. \nThe essence of every Assassin\u2019s Creed game is really its historical setting, and Ubisoft\u2019s developers always put a huge amount of effort and research into realizing those places in an accurate way \u2014 even if the historical settings wind up populated with fictionalized versions of real-life people who often find themselves embroiled in the Assassins\u2019 and Templars\u2019 conflict. A whole new world \nIn Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins , Egypt gets a similar treatment. It\u2019s a huge country suffering through a critical transition. Cleopatra has been deposed by her brother, Ptolemy, who\u2019s being manipulated by the Order of the Ancients, a clandestine organization seeking to control Egypt. And approaching from outside Egypt\u2019s borders are the Roman Empire and Julius Caesar . \n\u201cIt was always a dream of ours to bring Ancient Egypt to life, as a developer. But also, it\u2019s something that\u2019s always in the top three settings that fans want,\u201d Ismail explained. \u201cHaving said that, bringing Ancient Egypt to life, the country that is Egypt, the sheer scope and size and variety of this world, making sure this world was contiguous and represented properly \u2026 there are many technical hurdles and challenges there. But we felt that we were at a state to be able to bring that world to life, and setting in 49 B.C.E. is because it was a time that was really crucial in the history of humanity and civilization. And so, to have the birth of something important felt meaningful. That was really the kick-starter to all this.\u201d Areas of ancient Egypt (left) and their digital counterparts (right) recreated in Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins . Water paintings by Jean-Claude Golvin. \nUbisoft showed off a portion of the game to journalists during the preview event, which represented just a chunk of the overall map of the game. It featured rivers, farms, ruins and burgeoning villages, and players could find themselves battling rogue hippopotamuses one moment, and interrogating shopkeepers in a small market square the next. While much of our time was concerned with finding treasures and fighting villains \u2014 the same kind of side-quests that have populated Assassin\u2019s Creed games for years \u2014 those quests spanned a suitably huge countryside, from deserts to Nile farmlands to ruins and back again. Bringing things closer to home \nWhere we picked up the story, central protagonist Bayek and his wife Aya find themselves defending the now-deposed Cleopatra against the Order of the Ancients. Centering the story on a husband and wife team, Ismail said, helped to make Origins a more mature story than some other entries in the series. \n\u201cWhen we decided on the birth of the brotherhood and being set in this time period, first we wanted the tone to be a little bit more mature,\u201d Ismail said. \n\u201c\u2026 his views on life are being challenged, politically speaking, religiously speaking, on a very personal level\u201d \n\u201cThe other element was, we wanted the birth to be somehow very personal. It wasn\u2019t a group of people who decided, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s start a group of assassins and we\u2019ll have meetings around nice tables.\u2019 The idea was that this is a very personal story that is fundamentally showcasing two people who love each other dearly, who have the same objective, but that look at the world from two different points of view. \n\u201cWe were asking ourselves, how can we create a relatable set of characters that are dealing with the problems that any one of us could be having, and so a husband and wife relationship felt quite perfect for showcasing the trials for two people who really love one another. Yes, there can be friction, there can be antagonism between these two even if there is chemistry and there is love, and there is even a similar objective. We thought it gave us the opportunity for really high drama.\u201d \nBayek is an Egyptian himself, rooted in the ancient culture. Assassin\u2019s Creed games have often presented history fans might find familiar, but not from a commonly taught perspective, at least not the perspective taught in countries such as the U.S. In the original Assassin\u2019s Creed , players took on the role of Altair, a Muslim assassin facing off against invading European Crusaders. And in Assassin\u2019s Creed III , players witnessed the founding of the United States from the perspective of a Native American man who went by the Anglicized name Connor. \nBoth of those games deal with the less rosy elements of history. ACIII brought up George Washington\u2019s military dealings with Native American tribes, for instance, and raised the question of whether the Founding Fathers could really be seen as brave pursuers of liberty when they owned and kept slaves. Ismail said the Egyptian perspective on the changing world will inform Assassin\u2019s Creed: Origins \u2019 story in its own way. Bayek and Aya in Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins \n\u201cIt was very important for us that we tell the story from the perspective of, let\u2019s say, Bayek, who is an authentically native Egyptian,\u201d Ismail explained. \u201cWe wanted a character that maybe even represented Old Egypt, and he\u2019s being challenged, his views on life are being challenged, politically speaking, religiously speaking, on a very personal level.\u201d Larger than life \nBayek and Aya encounter some major historical figures during the course of the story. There\u2019s Cleopatra, of course, as well as Ptolemy and Caesar. Ismail said it was important to create grounded portrayals of even the most historically renown characters, rather than turning them into larger-than-life, idealized historical versions. \n\u201cIn terms of Cleopatra and Caesar and Ptolemy, our starting point is research,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do a lot of research, whether it\u2019s from Egyptologists and historians, to more media, how were these characters portrayed in TV shows, movies, whatever. It\u2019s not to recreate those interpretations, but to make sure we have all the funnels of information to be able to come up with our interpretation. \n\u201cFor characters like Cleopatra and Caesar, let\u2019s say, these are \u2026 they\u2019re bigger than life, they\u2019re almost caricatures, what we know of them. And the thing is, what we wanted to represent are human beings that have strengths and weaknesses, that have ambitions, that have faults. They\u2019ve accomplished incredible things, they also have really wonderful strengths.\u201d \nBefore the demo shown to journalists, Ubisoft played a cutscene setting up the story in which Bayek and Aya found themselves meeting with Cleopatra. \n\u201cThat was kind of touching on the element that at some point, she\u2019s a phenomenal woman, but she\u2019s a human being,\u201d Ismail said. \u201cShe has to count on other people. She has to rely on others, she\u2019s not an actual goddess as she portrays herself to be, or even as her people believe her to be. So, she has to rely on other people, she has helpers, she has people who betray her. So how does this person, psychologically speaking, deal with all that. We played a little bit with that.\u201d \nIsmail also said fans can expect Assassin\u2019s Creed: Origins to add to the lore of the incredibly powerful First Civilization that the series has been building on, in fits and starts, since the very beginning. Areas of ancient Egypt (left) and their digital counterparts (right) recreated in Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins . Water paintings by Jean-Claude Golvin. \n\u201cWe\u2019re in Egypt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have tombs, we have temples, we have this pantheon of gods, Egyptian mythology. I mean, people can look at previous AC games and maybe see links that existed, so for sure, how can we do a game in Egypt without touching those links?\u201d \nThat\u2019s a lot of story elements to weave together, and Assassin\u2019s Creed: Origins is poised to be the biggest game in the series yet. A more mature story telling a personal tale that sparks the beginning of the Assassin Brotherhood is certainly an interesting idea.

Viewers can then tap their pick to vote. The totals are tallied up inside the Story, allowing viewers to see which option is collecting the most votes in real time. \nThe poll sticker allows users to type in a question, then choose two answers, which are by default set to yes and no. The sticker can be resized, tilted and placed anywhere on the image, and can also be layered with other graphics, or you can use the drawing tools to color behind the sticker. For now, the colors and fonts are not adjustable. \nAlong with seeing the vote count, the Instagrammer that shared the poll in the first place can see which followers picked which option. The results are accessed by the same method users apply to see who viewed a Story \u2014 by swiping up inside the Story. Since the new poll option is only inside Stories, the poll \u2014 and the results \u2014 disappear after 24 hours. \nAlong with the new poll option, Instagram now allows users to pull colors from the photo itself while creating graphics inside a Story. Now, inside options like the drawing and text tools, an eyedropper appears on the left side of the menu. Using the new tool, you can place the eyedropper anywhere on the photo to grab a specific color from the image, which means those graphics can perfectly coordinate with the image. \nAlong with the eye-dropper, the update also includes a new alignment tool. When placing or moving a sticker, a blue line pops up to help you determine the center of the image, helping to avoid awkward placements and cut-off graphics. The same line pops up when rotating a sticker, in case you want to go back to keeping the graphic perfectly horizontal. \nInstagram Stories have been a focus for updates on the platform since launching last year, with updates for expanded stickers , location-based Stories , and replies, as well as the expansion of Stories options to mobile browsers . \nThe updates for Instagram version 16 are now live in the App Store and Google Play.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagrammer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram stories", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T00:18:30.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "647197fc0f12fe878cae258c00dc9743338350eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeKLTpo5VP.bMA19uV7ujIRPOVQxjUPh1YAwvNvzF.dky", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "A Beginner's Guide to Artificial Superintelligence and 'The Singularity' | Digital Trends", "title_full": "A Beginner's Guide to Artificial Superintelligence and 'The Singularity' | Digital Trends", "published": "2017-10-04T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.221, "main_image": "https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/dt10-mem-ai-feature-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg?ver=1", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 102, "comments": 4, "shares": 102}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 8}, "linkedin": {"shares": 43}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "647197fc0f12fe878cae258c00dc9743338350eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz5OAJu0FfRzeKLTpo5VP.bMA19uV7ujIRPOVQxjUPh1YAwvNvzF.dky", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Luke Dormehl", "published": "2017-10-04T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Beginner's Guide to Artificial Superintelligence and 'The Singularity' | Digital Trends", "text": "A beginner\u2019s guide to A.I. superintelligence and \u2018the singularity\u2019 By Luke Dormehl \u2014 Posted on October 4, 2017 7:00 am Why it matters to you Our beginner's guide will fill you in on everything you need to know about the (possibly) forthcoming AI technological singularity. \nHave you heard people talking about the technological singularity, either positively or negatively, but didn\u2019t know enough to join in? Want to know if you should pack your bags and flee for the hills to escape the coming robot invasion? Or maybe join a church to welcome our new robot overlords? First, make sure to check out our beginner\u2019s guide to all your singularity queries. What exactly is the singularity? \nThe technological singularity, to use its full title, is a hypothesis predicted on the creation of artificial superintelligence. Unlike the \u201cnarrow\u201d A.I. we have today -- which can be extremely good at carrying out one task, but can\u2019t function in as many domains as a more generalized intelligence such as our own -- a superintelligence would possess abilities greater than our own. This would trigger a kind of tipping point in which enormous changes take place in human society. \nWith A.I., particularly deep learning neural networks , hitting new milestones on a seemingly daily basis, here in 2017 the idea doesn\u2019t seem quite as science fiction as it once did. Is this a new idea? \nNo. As is the case with a lot of A.I., these ideas have been circulating for awhile -- even though it\u2019s only relatively recently that fields like deep learning have started to break through into the mainstream. I.J. Good , a British mathematician who worked with Alan Turing as a cryptologist during World War II, first suggested the concept of an intelligence explosion back in 1965. \nHis common sense view was that, as computers become increasingly powerful, so too does their capacity for problem solving and coming up with inventive solutions to problems. Eventually, superintelligent machines will design even better machines, or simply rewrite themselves to become smarter. The results are a recursive self-improvement which is either very good, or very bad for humanity as a whole. \nThis idea was later picked up by Vernor Vinge , a sci-fi writer, mathematics professor and computer scientist. In a famous 1993 essay, \u201c The Coming Technological Singularity \u201d Vinge made the famous prediction that: \u201cWithin 30 years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after that, the human era will be ended.\u201d So Vinge was the guy who coined the term \u2018singularity\u2019 then? \nNot really. Vinge may have popularized it, but the term \"singularity\" was first applied to computers by the mathematician John von Neumann , one of the most important figures in modern computing. Towards the end of the end of his life, in the 1950s, von Neumann was both fascinated and alarmed by \u201cthe ever-accelerating progress of technology and changes in the modes of human life, which gives the appearance of some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.\u201d When exactly is all this supposed to happen? \nThanks for asking the easy questions. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, Vernor Vinge gave a 30-year time table back in 1993. That would place the singularity at some time before or during 2023. Futurist and singularity enthusiast Ray Kurzweil , meanwhile, has pegged 2029 as the date when A.I. will pass a valid Turing test and achieve human levels of intelligence. After this, he thinks the singularity will take place in 2045, at which point \u201cwe will multiply our effective intelligence a billionfold by merging with the intelligence we have created.\u201d \nOthers have argued that both of these are ridiculously premature estimates, based on a faulty understanding of what comprises intelligence. And Terminator 2: Judgment Day , one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time, placed the point at which computers become \u201cself-aware\u201d as being 2.14am Eastern on August 4, 1997. So who really knows? Skynet, self-aware computers, and merging with our own machines\u2026. I\u2019m not really sure how to feel about any of this. \nYou, me, and everyone else. Imagining what the singularity would be like is a bit like trying to visualize a totally new color the world has never seen before. Remember that Aaron Sorkin-penned Mark Zuckerberg line from The Social Network about how, \u201cIf you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you' d have invented Facebook?\u201d Well, the same thing applies for non superintelligent beings like us trying to imagine how a superintelligence would view the world. \nSuperintelligence has the opportunity to solve all of our problems almost immediately. Or it could deem us an unnecessary risk and wipe us out in a moment. Or we could become its new pets, kept busy with whatever the human-entertaining equivalent of a cat\u2019s laser toy might be. Geez, you make it sound like the singularity is going to be some kind of godlike presence, dispensing a choice of wrath or salvation. \nYou\u2019re not kidding! There\u2019s definitely something religious about the zeal with which some people talk about the singularity. It\u2019s almost like Silicon Valley\u2019s answer to the rapture, in which we\u2019re permanently unburdened of our status as the smartest guys and gals in the room by an all-seeing presence. Heck, there are even clouds (or, well, the cloud) involved in this heavenly scenario. \nCase in point: Anthony Levandowski \u2013 the engineer who worked on Google\u2019s autonomous car -- has created a religious nonprofit which looks a whole lot like a church devoted to the worship of A.I.. Why don\u2019t we just pull the plug right now? \nWell, that would certainly be one option, just like we could solve poverty, financial inequality, wars and Justin Bieber by carrying out a complete 100 percent extermination of the human race. If all A.I. research was to stop right now, then the prospect of the singularity would certA.I.nly be averted. But who wants that? And who would enforce it? Right now, AI is helping improve life for billions of people . It\u2019s also making a whole lot of money for the owners of companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, and others. \nAt present, we don\u2019t yet have artificial superintelligence, and even the most impressive examples of A.I. are comparatively narrow in what they can achieve. Even if it is possible to one day replicate a true intelligence inside a computer, some people hope there will be ways to control it without it taking over. For example, one idea might be to keep a superintelligence in an isolated environment with no access to the internet. (Then again, the researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky thinks that, like attempts to keep Hannibal Lecter locked up, no superintelligent A.I. will be contained for long .) \nOther proposals say that we\u2019ll be alright so long as we program A.I. to behave in a way that\u2019s good and moral . (But Nick Bostrom\u2019s \u201cpaperclip maximizer\u201d thought experiment pokes a few holes in that one, too.) It\u2019s definitely a concern, though -- which is something voiced by everyone from Elon Musk to Stephen Hawking . \nThen again, if superintelligence turns out to be the greatest thing that ever happened to humanity, do we really want to stop it? Is the singularity our only concern with A.I.? \nAbsolutely not. There are plenty of other concerns involving artificial intelligence that don\u2019t involve superintelligence -- with the impact of A.I. on employment and the use of A.I. and robots in warfare being just two. In other words, cheer up: there\u2019s a whole lot more than the singularity to worry about when it comes to A.I.

The earbuds are connected to a Bluetooth dongle at the end of the headphone wire, which terminates at about the same spot that the earbud wires converge on the wired version. So, while you\u2019ll still have to deal with some cables, you\u2019ll be untethered from whatever device you\u2019ll be listening to. The dongle houses both the Bluetooth receiver and a battery, which can be charged via micro USB for up to five and a half hours of playback time. \nThe most important point of comparison are the drivers. Like the Xelento Remote, the Xelento Wireless use Tesla transducers, which are made with tiny ring magnets and voice coils designed to offer the same fluid and exquisite audio that we loved in the Xelento Remote. \nWhile it\u2019s one thing to be equipped with high-performance drivers, wireless headphones have to contend with the obstacle of connection quality. It may seem unreliable to use Bluetooth as the transmission method, especially when these headphones are being marketed to the audiophile crowd, but Beyerdynamic is opting for the aptX HD codec (for those with aptX compatible devices), which is designed to enable 24-bit transmission at full resolution (The Xelento Wireless also supports aptX, AAC, and SBC Bluetooth). For those who want the option to listen via wired connection \u2014 or in the event your battery runs out \u2014 the Xelento wireless\u2019 Bluetooth dongle features a 3.5mm jack to plug into. \nConsidering this is a pair of headphones aimed at audiophiles, the Xelento Remote carry a premium price tag. The wired Xelento Remote cost a whopping $1,000, so it\u2019s no surprise that the Xelento wireless will be going for $1,200. Beyerdynamic is launching the headphones at the 2017 Rocky Mountain Audio Fest , which takes place October 6-8 in Denver, Colorado.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T00:22:21.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d099c444156d442c5c1d471bdf06a2003f87bfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8AhdU.UXby2GevNVvb6pjkSqewXZkCuN72E1Ex5fhgMggWg--", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Cribitt app wants to help New Yorkers find an apartment fast", "title_full": "Cribitt app wants to help New Yorkers find an apartment fast", "published": "2017-10-04T20:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.17, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/cribitt-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 13, "comments": 0, "shares": 13}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d099c444156d442c5c1d471bdf06a2003f87bfc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8AhdU.UXby2GevNVvb6pjkSqewXZkCuN72E1Ex5fhgMggWg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lulu Chang", "published": "2017-10-04T20:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cribitt app wants to help New Yorkers find an apartment fast", "text": "Home > Home > Cribitt app wants to help New Yorkers find an\u2026 Cribitt app wants to help New Yorkers find an apartment fast Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you With Cribitt, you can select an apartment, book an appointment, and get a new home in New York with a tap of a button. \nLiving in New York City is difficult enough, and that doesn\u2019t even take into consideration how hard it is to just find a place to live. Not only are apartments in New York among the most expensive in the U.S., but they are also some of the fastest moving as well. But now, there\u2019s an app that could help you snag that great deal with great speed. It\u2019s called Cribitt and it is heralded as the \u201conly on-demand rental app,\u201d allowing renters to summon an agent and view apartments with the tap of a button. \nUsing Cribitt, your smartphone is all you need to discover available apartments, coordinate instant viewings, and even apply for a new residence. Simply select an apartment that catches your eye, summon a broker, and keep tabs on said broker\u2019s location in real time to avoid unexpected delays or the dreaded no-show. While other apps and websites require users to call agents to book their appointments up to days in advance, Cribitt wants to make everything fully responsive to the renter\u2019s schedule. \n\u201cThe real estate industry is at least a decade behind when it comes to incorporating technology and the process of renting an apartment has hardly changed in the last 10 years,\u201d Cribitt founder and CEO Stephen Steiner said in a statement. \u201cRenters still have to mine through listings \u2014 many of which are often no longer available, call to schedule a viewing and take a gamble on whether or not the agent shows up. Cribitt eliminates that uncertainty for both the renter and the agent.\u201d \nCribitt not only wants to benefit apartment hunters, but purveyors as well.

But what they fail to understand is that there are plenty of riders who don\u2019t get on a bike to see how fast or far they can go, but instead see them as a basic form of transportation instead. Those cyclists are looking for a comfortable ride that will allow them to commute to and from work, run errands around town, and arrive at a destination still feeling fresh and clean. That is exactly the idea behind the Avenue , the latest ebike from Gazelle , which was built specifically with those kinds of urban riders in mind. \nWith its lightweight aluminum frame and low-step design, the Gazelle Avenue has a look that is far less intimidating to new riders than some of the more aggressive-looking ebikes on the market. It features 26-inch wheels and integrated cables, as well as Magura brakes for safe and easy stopping in high traffic environments. The bike\u2019s geometry includes a 68-degree headtube angle and a 70-degree seat tube angle, which translates to a more upright and comfortable seated position while riding. This makes the Avenue more akin to a cruiser rather than a traditional road bike. \nPowered by a Shimano STEPS drive system , the Avenue has an average range of about 50 miles before its 504-watt battery needs a recharge. Riders who rely less on the ebike\u2019s pedal-assist functionality could extend that range out to as far as 80 miles, however, depending on the bike\u2019s settings. The electric drive is reportedly almost completely silent, offers up to three levels of pedal assist, and has seamless automatic shifting through its eight gears. It even comes with a \u201cwalk assist\u201d mode that kicks in when riders get off the bike and push it instead. \nThe Avenue is available now in three frame sizes (45, 51, and 57) and in one color (saturn blue) \u2014 although Gazelle promises that more options are coming soon. It is competitively priced at $2,899, with options to add premium accessories including a front basket for carrying extra cargo. Find out more at gazellebikes.com .

They may not offer the same production values as the newest Call of Duty or Halo release, but then again, they won\u2019t cost you upwards of $60 either. Here are our top picks for the best free first-person shooter games, so you can frag fools and save money. Blacklight Retribution (Windows, PlayStation 4 ) \nBlacklight Retribution offers the simple perk to every player right out of the gates. Among its novel features, the game also offers a wide variety of intense game modes, highly customizable weapons and armor, and futuristic technology that will keep you playing and upgrading for a long time. The visual and graphical interfaces are gorgeous, while the convenient weapon depots and hulking hardsuits provide additional means of playing the title\u2019s nine maps and seven classic game modes. \nPlayers also earn points in a variety of ways throughout matches to enable in-game perks, such as health replenishment and heavy artillery, furthering the gameplay alongside the thousands of available gun combinations and mod attachments. However, permanently earning in-game bonuses takes time, so simplicity will have to do for a good while. Download now from: Team Fortress 2 (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) \nBoasting beautifully-rendered graphics and a well-balanced class system, the lauded Team Fortress 2 still appeals to casual gamers and pros alike, garnering what is still one of the largest player bases on the Steam marketplace more than seven years after its initial debut. The game is a steadfast hybrid of fast-paced combat and intense strategy in which every one of the game\u2019s nine classes exhibits its own powerful strengths and crippling weaknesses. \nGame modes are straightforward, primarily pitting two teams against one another in an effort to move a cart, capture select points, or steal a briefcase. It\u2019s highly competitive in nature, but it still caters to all skill levels. Like most multiplayer titles, it\u2019s about exploiting the Achilles heel of your enemies while protecting your own, but it still relishes a stylized brand of humor that has become iconic for the Team Fortress brand. Few games have held up as well over the years, and to be honest, few probably will. Download now from: Red Trigger (Windows) \nBorn as Maxime V\u00e9zina\u2019s final college assignment, Red Trigger plays like anything but a student project. A simple white, blue, and red color scheme gives players a platformer with a toned-down Portal aesthetic. You wield a lone gun used to shoot red platforms which either expand or retract. The platforms can be used for defense or to move forward. Your ultimate goal is to decimate a computer system with the self-injected eponymous virus by reaching the end of each stage. Solving puzzles is half the battle, as the platforming elements, much like Portal , become the main barrier to progress. \nWhile it isn\u2019t a violent shooting gallery, Red Trigger is a gunplay-driven first-person puzzler: Impressive and charming, it will scratch an itch for precision shooting and puzzle solving for the price of nothing but your time. The experience lasts for about an hour, so it\u2019s the perfect free-to-play game to tinker with on an evening when you just can\u2019t figure out what to play. Download now from: Tribes: Ascend (Windows) \nIn Tribes: Ascend , players maneuver using a jetpack and skis, traversing massive environments at breakneck speeds, whether by their own accord or using a variety of in-game vehicles. The game features a wide variety of modes, and nine unlockable classes, each of which offers its own distinct set of weaponry and skills obtainable through the game\u2019s progression system. \nThe enormous maps are also a great fit for the objective and defense-based game modes, focusing on a breadth of aerial dogfights and mid-air explosions, instead of emphasizing cover and well-rehearsed strategy like most titles. Furthermore, the character models are finely polished, and the gameplay allows up to 32 players to compete in hallmark game modes such as capture the flag, team deathmatch, and five-on-five arena battles. The menu navigation and feature set may not define it, but the high-speed combat and Tribes: Ascend \u2018s consistently-expansive updates certainly do. Download now from: Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) \nWolfenstein: Enemy Territory picked up quite a bit of steam since it was originally released as a multiplayer-only title in 2003. It garnered considerable support for its classic ranking and experience system, die-hard community, and innovative class system \u2014 even though the graphics were never quite on par with competitive offerings, even then. \nEasy to play but difficult to master, the game allows players to take on the role of either Axis or Allies, pitting them in team-based combat spanning a variety of objective-based scenarios. Up to 32 players can choose from one of five distinct classes and compete on three maps, each of which is linked to an over-arching campaign. However, the title\u2019s true lasting appeal lies within the aforementioned class system, providing a welcome set of battlefield promotions that come coupled with enhanced skills and additional weaponry such as land mines and the mobile MG-42. Download now from: Planetside 2 (Windows, PlayStation 4) \nWith planet-spanning battles and three diverse factions, Planetside 2 ups the ante on everyday first-person shooters. Everything the player does affects their faction\u2019s success in battle, from killing enemies to buying vehicles and taking enemy control points, all of which takes place on a massive scale featuring lean animation and exceptional skill trees. The diverse combat ensures no two matches are ever the same, placing players against one another in custom tank battles one minute, and urban firefights and aerial onslaughts the next. It all gives players the opportunity to unlock weapons, attachments, skills, and other components through the game\u2019s intuitive leveling system. \nThe core of Planetside 2 revolves around holding crucial territories and claiming key resources, with hundreds of players fighting it out over the course of multi-day and week-long battles. Turning the tide takes teamwork \u2014 and sometimes being a cog in the machine isn\u2019t so bad.

Mixing in smart home capabilities move itwell beyond sound. \nSonos announced the all-new Sonos One smart speaker in early October, the company\u2019s first product with voice control \u2014 and it\u2019s a doozy. Our Sonos One review described it as \u201cthe perfect smart speaker.\u201d At launch, the Sonos One smart speaker will integrate with Amazon\u2019s digital assistant, Alexa, but the speaker is designed to support multiple voice-control platforms \u2014 in 2018, the Sonos One will be updated to support Google Assistant as well. \nNot to be left out, existing Sonos speaker owners will be able to control their systems via Alexa through any of Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker devices pursuant to a software update issued later Wednesday. Airplay 2 support is coming for iOS device owners, and for those who have longed to be able to control their Sonos speakers from individual music apps like they do with Spotify, Sonos revealed that in-app control would be coming to Pandora and Tidal later this year, with iHeart Radio soon to follow. Sonos One \nThe new Sonos One speaker looks a whole lot like the company\u2019s existing Play:1 speaker , but a closer look reveals a key difference: A six-microphone array installed at the top of the speaker. Under the hood is additional hardware which allows the speaker to accept and process voice commands. Everything else that makes a Sonos speaker sound like a Sonos speaker is still baked right in. \nIn demonstration videos Sonos showed at its New York City unveiling, it appeared to be unnecessary for users to address the speaker by saying Alexa\u2019s name to wake it up. However, during the hands-on demos, Sonos reps made it explicitly clear that you will indeed have to call out Alexa in order to control your Sonos One. \nDuring the hands-on demos, the Sonos One could be controlled by swiping on top of the device. Similar to the Playbase and Play:5 , you can skip a track or play a previous track by swiping to the right and to the left, respectively. Unlike its predecessors, though, you can also control video playback from streaming services like YouTube when sound is routed to the Sonos One. \nYou can pre-order a Sonos One smart speaker here . From trash to treasure \nSonos One\u2019s six microphones are similar to the microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphones found in smartphones, and the company is pretty excited about the new system. In fact, Klaus Hartung, Sonos\u2019 director of smart audio and voice, was so eager to test the new mics he used one of the company\u2019s discarded foam mockups to try them out. \u201cI wanted to test something out, so someone fished it out of a garbage bin in Santa Barbara and Fedexed it over to me. We simply \u2026 drilled some holes in it and put microphones in it, and we put it in the anechoic chamber and we measured it,\u201d Hartung told Digital Trends at the Sonos One unveiling. \u201cSometimes we call them Frankenstein units.\u201d \nSonos has two anechoic chambers \u2014 one in Santa Barbara, CA and one in Boston, MA \u2014 which are \u201csoundproof\u201d rooms often employed by speaker designers in order to analyze components without acoustic interference. The company did extensive testing inside the chambers with the Sonos One to create an algorithm that allows the mics to suppress ambient noise and focus on the direct sound of a voice. Now you can be the control freak \nPreviously, Sonos operated a closed, very tightly controlled system. It wanted its hardware and software to work seamlessly together, and always work perfectly for its customers. The company feels it has achieved that experience, but now Sonos has to look beyond its heavily fortified fortress and start letting others in. \nDuring its announcement in New York today, Sonos revealed it has opened up its platform and started working with developers from over 100 different partners. While that might sound like inside baseball, it is the very same practice that has led Amazon\u2019s Alexa to its rampant popularity today \u2014 Alexa is virtually everywhere now, and Sonos likely wants to enjoy the same sort of omnipresence. \nBy allowing other tech companies to integrate their software and hardware with Sonos products, Sonos itself will play a bigger role in smart home systems. Perhaps instead of a traditional doorbell, you hear a clip of your favorite song coming from a Sonos speaker anytime someone presses the button at the door, for instance. \nWith the integration of Amazon Alexa into Sonos\u2019 products, the speaker company is entering what it calls the \u201c sonic internet\u201d \u2014 i.e., the internet of things with voice assistance. \u201cWe really will keep an open attitude with what\u2019s the role of voice, how is it compelling, which products should have it, which products should not have it. Maybe, ultimately, all products have it,\u201d Tad Toulis, vice president of design at Sonos, told Digital Trends. More Apple integration \nSonos knows which side its bread is buttered on and hasn\u2019t forgotten the partner which bring it to where it is today. Announced today, Airplay 2 is coming to Sonos speakers next year. This will allow Sonos speaker control from iOS devices and through any Siri interface. Potentially, this could mean Sonos speakers like the Sonos PlayBar and PlayBase could work wirelessly with the Apple TV 4K . \nThe Sonos One smart speaker is only the latest way Sonos is trying to make your listening experience smarter. The company recently unveiled its Wrensilva Sonos Edition Record Console , a turntable set-up connected to two of Sonos\u2019 Play:5 speakers . The console was designed after the sleek style of Sonos\u2019 NYC flagship store and looks like a piece of furniture from The Jetsons. You can toggle between the past and thanks to the ability to switch between streaming music or a built-in turntable by simply turning the nob on the console. \nYou can get your hands on the Sonos One when it goes on sale on October 24. Pre-orders for the device are available as of Wednesday. If you happen to find yourself in New York City, you can get an early hands-on test with the new smart speaker at the company\u2019s NYC store. \nUpdate: Added link to our review of the Sonos One.

Using one of Rethink Robotics\u2019 Baxter robots , a VR headset, and maybe a page or two from mecha anime like the classic Mobile Suit Gundam Wing , they created a smart head-mounted \u201csensor display\u201d system which puts human operators in the head of the robot they are controlling. \n\u201cA lot of jobs are difficult to do remotely, particularly in manufacturing and industry,\u201d Jeffrey Lipton , one of the postdoctoral researchers who worked on the project, told Digital Trends. \u201cA system like this could one day allow humans to supervise robots from a distance. This would enable employees to work from home, and could even open up manufacturing jobs to people with physical limitations, [such as those] who can\u2019t lift heavy or bulky objects. Many industrial jobs are also terrible for human health \u2014 imagine servicing the inside of an airplane or working out on an oil rig. They can be dangerous, cramped and uncomfortable, but right now they need a human mind to understand, make decisions, and do movements. We think this model of teleoperation could allow us to keep humans safe and away from these sites while leveraging human mental capabilities.\u201d Jason Dorfman/MIT CSAIL \nMIT\u2019s smart system embeds the user in a virtual reality control room with multiple sensor displays, allowing the user to see everything the robot is seeing at any given moment. To execute tasks, the human then employs gestures \u2014 picked up courtesy of hand controllers \u2014 which are mirrored by the robot.

The Well has a level of polish that will turn more than a few heads. \nTurtle Rock Studios, best known for multiplayer games like Left 4 Dead and Evolve , has announced its next game, which promises to be a much more personal experience. Coming exclusively to Samsung Gear VR , The Well is a turn-based fantasy role-playing game built specifically for VR. It features a \u201cstorybook art style\u201d and a \u201cdark, dreamlike atmosphere.\u201d \nWhile playing The Well , players explore the ancient world of Tholl to defeat the demonic Tesh. This destructive force is throwing off the balance between the peaceful villagers and the barbaric tribes in the wilderness. Players choose between one of four classes \u2014 Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Druid \u2014 each with their own set of spells and abilities. Along the way, other characters will join the party and level up over time to unlock new abilities. \nFor those who doubt Turtle Rock\u2019s ability to create a quality experience in virtual reality, this isn\u2019t the first time the studio has created a VR game. It\u2019s actually its fourth. Previous titles include Face Your Fears , Blade Runner 2049: Replicant Pursuit , and Otherworlds . All can be found on the Gear VR Store . \n\u201c The Well is not only our most ambitious VR title to date, it is our most unique,\u201d said Turtle Rock GM Steve Goldstein in a statement to Gamespot . \u201cWe\u2019re excited to create a new, original fantasy world unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, and it\u2019s specifically crafted for the Gear VR platform. It\u2019s not just a fun game, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201dPriced at $10, The Well launches for Samsung Gear VR on October 11, which is the first day of this year\u2019s Oculus Connect event , where the game will also be playable. \nTo get the most out of Samsung Gear VR, players should get their hands on a controller. A new headset with the controller included can cost as little as $98 new depending on the user\u2019s phone. Early adopters looking to improve their experience can pick up a stand-alone controller for $25. \nIn October 2016, Turtle Rock Studios ceased support on its previous multiplatform release, Evolve .

Announced on October 4 during an event in San Francisco , the Google Pixel 2 camera sports background blur without a second camera, dual optical and electronic image stabilization, automatic HDR and augmented reality stickers inside the native camera mode. Oh, and with a rating of 98, the Pixel 2 also earns the highest rating for any smartphone camera yet from DxOMark . \nThe updates stem from Google\u2019s focus on mixing machine learning, hardware, and software across its entire line of new products. Machine learning is responsible for a number of the Pixel 2\u2019s new features. First, the Google Pixel 2 includes a portrait mode that, like the last few iPhone Plus phones , simulates background blur that more closely resembles the photos shot from a DSLR, rather than a small sensor smartphone. The difference? Pixel 2 doesn\u2019t need two cameras to do it. Google / YouTube \nInstead of creating a 3D depth map by comparing the different views from the two different locations, Pixel 2 uses a dual pixel sensor, comparing the right and left sides of the pixel to determine what objects are close to the camera and what is in the background. Machine learning software then applies the blur effect to the background. According to Google\u2019s Aparna Chennapragada, the system is very accurate, even with busy backgrounds or when photographing an object instead of a person. \nBesides the fact that the one-camera requirement means the feature is available without moving to the larger phablet-sized XL, the portrait mode is also available with the front-facing camera in the Pixel 2. \nComputational photography is also responsible for the Pixel 2\u2019s boost in photo quality using an automatic HDR. When a photo is shot on the Pixel 2, the camera takes several images at slightly different exposure levels, then aligns them via software on a pixel-for-pixel basis. With the data from multiple files, the resulting image contains more detail in the lightest and darkest areas of the image. Chennapragada says that all of this happens instantly, with no shutter lag between shots as the smartphone processes the files. \nBoth hardware and computational photography are also responsible for the Pixel 2\u2019s boost in low light stills and video. Dubbed Fused Video Stabilization, the Pixel 2 essentially uses both the optical stabilization, the hardware-type system that doesn\u2019t create a loss in image quality, and electronic stabilization, which measures any remaining shake and crops the footage to steady the shot. Google / YouTube \nBesides capturing the real world, the Google Pixel 2 includes built-in augmented reality stickers. While AR stickers are growing in popularity in apps like Snapchat and Facebook Camera, the Pixel 2 is the first mainstream smartphone to our knowledge to include AR inside the native camera mode instead of a third-party app. The AR stickers, which range from emojis to characters from movies including Stranger Things and Star Wars, aren\u2019t just placed in the scene but move around. Place two stickers, and they\u2019ll even interact with each other. \nGoogle says that factors like emotions, physics, and even the lighting in the scene all blend together to make the virtual characters feel like part of the scene. \u201cNow you can be the director of all kinds of stories and share these with friends,\u201d Chennapragada said. \u201c\u2026The stickers are so easy to use and they look great because the Pixel camera is specially calibrated for AR with pixel tracking and 60 fps. The camera can bridge the physical and digital with AR.\u201d \nThe Pixel 2 also features a motion photos mode, a shooting style that captures three seconds of video behind the scenes. \nThe Pixel 2\u2019s camera specs are rounded out with a 12.1-megapixel sensor paired with an f/1.8 lens and an updated, dual pixel autofocus system. The front-facing camera uses an eight-megapixel sensor. \nAll those features factor into the Pixel 2\u2019s DxO score of 98, the highest score yet from the third-party camera testing company for any smartphone. Last month, DxO Mark updated its testing for smartphones to include factors like the artificial background blur from portrait mode. While the updated guidelines suggest that the Pixel 2 has one of the best cameras for smartphones, the guidelines don\u2019t directly compare it under the rest of DxOMark\u2019s tests, so the Pixel 2\u2019s score of 98 doesn\u2019t compare to the same 98 earned by the full frame Sony a7R II . \nThe Pixel 2\u2019s camera will also come into play for more than just shooting photos \u2014 a preview of Google Lens , an artificially intelligent computer-vision program, is built into the Google Photos and Google Assistant native apps. The feature allows users to snap a photo of a flyer and copy and paste an email address or phone number without retyping, and to discover more about art, movies, books and music by snapping a photo. \nAll those features suggest users will be taking a lot of photos with the Pixel 2 \u2014 but the included Google Photos app also now gives Pixel 2 owners free, unlimited photo storage. The app also uses an automatic tagging system, making all those photos easy to search through. \nPricing for the Google Pixel 2 starts at $649, with the XL starting at $849.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aparna chennapragada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chennapragada", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google pixel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook camera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dslr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google lens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google photos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pixel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T01:43:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb90d0e557c96480c4aa330ba7fe4b07f9500b48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBlJfEkMyLcfgYxj.YrJPb.rayjhIbFrDjX4A.ZVx5TRx1anc49rkGPczkqHeD0cRNld7m9dU5pJQ-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.topix.com/rss/wire/tech", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Fire it up from far away - these are the best remote car starters around", "title_full": "Fire it up from far away - these are the best remote car starters around", "published": "2017-10-05T00:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/car-remote-starter-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb90d0e557c96480c4aa330ba7fe4b07f9500b48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBlJfEkMyLcfgYxj.YrJPb.rayjhIbFrDjX4A.ZVx5TRx1anc49rkGPczkqHeD0cRNld7m9dU5pJQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T00:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fire it up from far away - these are the best remote car starters around", "text": "Here are the best Apple accessory deals for the iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: \nA remote start system for your vehicle may sound like a niche gadget, but with more than a million aftermarket units sold in North America each year, it\u2019s clear these devices have a variety of attractive use cases.

A new project created by researchers at the Human Computer Interaction Lab at Germany\u2019s Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) builds on that idea \u2014 through the creation of a \u201cparasitic\u201d machine that requires human-generated energy in order to function, but which gives absolutely nothing back to the human user in return. Picture the robot equivalent of a mosquito, and you won\u2019t be a million miles off. \n\u201cThis is an art piece made by five researchers in human computer interaction: [myself], Alexandra Ion, David Lindbauer, Robert Kovacs and Professor Patrick Baudisch,\u201d Pedro Lopes , one of the creators, told Digital Trends. \u201cThe purpose is to stimulate the viewer or visitor. The project itself is a reversal of our own work in HCI where all our prototype technologies, much like in our everyday life, includes a human [coming out] on top of machines. We just wanted to let visitors try out how it feels if a \u2018machine is on top.\u2019\u201d \nThe device is housed in a rectangular acrylic tube, which features a crank mechanism and seat at each end. The crank-style levers invite you to grab them but, when you do, a pair of electrode cuffs lock your arm in place, and then stimulate your wrist muscles with small electric shocks to make you involuntarily crank the lever. Doing this generates kinetic energy, which keeps the machine going. The process is only ended (well, for you at least) when another person comes along and cranks the opposite lever \u2014 thereby taking over as the host. The machine\u2019s name? \u201cAd Infinitum.\u201d \nLopes says that the project grew out of five years of serious work on electrical muscle stimulation, and what exactly this could be used to achieve. When it comes to \u201cAd Infinitum\u201d he makes clear that the work is \u201c100 percent\u201d conceptual, although it certainly provokes plenty of interesting questions about the relationship between humans and the technology they use \u2014 and the symbiotic, occasionally parasitic, link between the two. (You can argue similar power dynamics when it comes to the use of data and how we willingly make smarter the machines that may one day replace us.) \nSo far, \u201cAd Infinitum\u201d has been shown off at events including the Science Gallery Dublin\u2019s \u201cHumans Need Not To Apply\u201d exhibition in Ireland, and \u201cThe Practice of Art and Science\u201d exhibition at Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria.

It has Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip, which compares favorably to the Pixel\u2019s Snapdragon 821 \u2014 Qualcomm claims the former has a 27 percent performance advantage. We will have to wait until we get our hands on the Pixel 2 to say for sure, but on paper, it comes out safely ahead of last year\u2019s Pixel in the raw power department. \nThe Pixel and Pixel 2 are a little more evenly matched when it comes to memory and radios. Both have Bluetooth 5.0, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage. The first-gen Pixel is at a slight disadvantage in that the cheaper model has just 32GB of storage, compared to the Pixel 2\u2019s baseline 64GB. But in most other respects, it\u2019s a tie between the two phones. \nIn the end, the Pixel 2\u2019s faster processor and higher storage capacity are enough to win the specs round. \nWinner: Pixel 2 Design, Display, and Durability Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends \nThe Pixel 2 takes more than a few design cues from its predecessor, but look a little closer and you will notice the differences. \nWhile the Pixel 2\u2019s glass-and-aluminum design mimics the original, down to the curved edges, rounded corners, thick top and bottom bezels, and two-tone rear cover. The glass inlay is smaller and the fingerprint sensor is part of the aluminum body this time around. The front camera has not budged from its top-left perch on the front panel, nor has the primary camera and flash from their respective spots on the rear. There is nothing much different about the Pixel 2\u2019s volume rocker, power button, and USB-C port, either. \nThe displays are mostly the same, too. Both the Pixel and Pixel 2 have 5-inch 1080p (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) P-OLED panels with higher-than-average contrast, deeper-than-average blacks, and ultra-wide viewing angles. The Pixel 2 slightly edges out its predecessor in color reproduction thanks to a wider gamut, but a Google-led effort to optimize both screens\u2019 touch responsiveness means it shouldn\u2019t be any less snappy than the first-gen Pixel. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends \nThat is where the similarities between the Pixel and Pixel 2 end, though. The Pixel 2 ditches its predecessor\u2019s 3.5mm audio jack. It ships with a USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter, but it\u2019s more of a band-aide solution than a fix. Embedded in the Pixel 2\u2019s bezels are two front-facing speakers (one above the screen and one below it) in stereo configuration, arguably a worthy consolation prize for that missing 3.5mm headphone jack. \nThe Pixel 2 isn\u2019t just louder than the Pixel \u2014 it\u2019s more durable too. It\u2019s IP67 certified, meaning it\u2019ll come up unscathed after a 30-minute dunk in a 3.5-foot pool of water. That is compared to the original Pixel\u2019s IP53 rating, which doesn\u2019t guarantee it will withstand anything more than a few splashes. \nOn top of the superior water resistance, the Pixel 2 has Corning\u2019s shatter-resistant Gorilla Glass 5 compared to the 2016 Pixel\u2019s Gorilla Glass 4. There is not a massive difference between the two, but Corning claims that Gorilla Glass 5 is \u201chighly\u201d (80 percent) likely to survive drops up to 5.2 feet, while Gorilla Glass 4 peaks at 3.2 feet. \nThe Pixel 2 may not look all that different than the 2016 Pixel. But appearances can be deceiving. In truth, the Pixel 2 can withstand a lot more abuse, and that\u2019s enough to win it this round. \nWinner: Pixel 2 Battery life and charging Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends \nThe Pixel and Pixel 2 are on par when it comes to the screens and design, and the same is true of battery life. The battery in the Pixel 2 has shrunk very slightly to 2,700mAh, compared to the 2,770 mAh battery in the original. \nOn the Pixel, Google pegs the battery at 19 days of standby time and up to 13 hours of 4G LTE internet browsing, which equates to about a full day of moderate multitasking. The Pixel 2 has a slight leg up thanks to its power-efficient Snapdragon 835 processor, but it doesn\u2019t work miracles \u2014 Google says the Pixel 2 will last a \u201cday\u201d on a charge, which could very well end up mirroring the first-gen Pixel\u2019s stats. \nOn the charging side of things, the Pixel and Pixel 2 are on equal footing. They both support the USB Power Delivery standard, which means that just 15 minutes of charging with a compatible wall adapter is enough to deliver around seven hours of battery life. \nThat is why we\u2019re calling this round a tie. From what we know so far, neither phone has the advantage when it comes to battery life and charging. \nWinner: Tie Camera \nThere is yet another category where the Pixel and Pixel 2 are alike, and it\u2019s the camera. \nThe Pixel 2 has almost the same camera hardware as the first-gen model, on paper at least. The Pixel 2 camera is rated at 12.2 megapixels, compared to the first Pixel\u2019s 12.3 megapixels. As for the front-facing camera, they\u2019re both rated at 8-megapixels with an f/2.4 aperture. The Pixel 2 has the same 1.4\u03bcm pixel size, the same dual pixel phase-detection technology, and the same laser autofocus sensor as the first-gen Pixel. It has roughly same video capabilities too \u2014 both phones\u2019 rear cameras can shoot up to 4K at 30 frames per second, or up to 1080p at 120 fps. \nBut the Pixel 2\u2019s camera is improved in other ways. It has an f/1.8 aperture as opposed to the Pixel\u2019s f/2.0, which should translate to better low-light shots, and a Google-designed imaging chip that can apply camera filters in real time. That is in addition to a \u201cfusion\u201d of optical image stabilization (OIS) and electronic image stabilization (EIS), which the aforementioned imaging chip taps to counteract jerky motions while recording video. \nAll those improvements together were enough to earn it a 98 from DxOMark , the highest score the company has ever awarded to a smartphone camera. \nThe Pixel 2\u2019s other differentiating features are software-based. It boasts an improved Portrait Mode-like bokeh mode that captures pics with an in-focus foreground and out-of-focus background (a la the iPhone ), and a Motion Photo feature that records a three-second clip before and after you tap the shutter button. \nThen there\u2019s Google Lens, an AI photo analyzer than can pick out books, DVD covers, architectural landmarks, and more. Thanks to Google-designed machine-learning chips that process more than 180 trillion floating point operations per second, Google Lens can give a description of a building in a photo, identify the artist of a painting, or even enter a Wi-Fi password automatically from a photo of the underside of a Wi-Fi router. \nGoogle says the Google Lens will eventually come to other platforms. On a technical level, there is nothing preventing Motion Photo from hitting the first-gen Pixel \u2014 both are built into the Google Camera, the camera app that ships on the Pixel and Pixel 2. But for now, the Pixel 2 has the advantage of timed exclusivity. \nIt is a close call when it comes to the cameras. But the Pixel 2\u2019s superior aperture, optical image stabilization, and wealth of software features win it the round. \nWinner: Pixel 2 Software \nSoftware is where the Pixel 2 really shines. It runs Android 8.0 Oreo, same as the first-gen Pixel, which received an upgrade to the new operating system earlier this year. \nAmong the highlights is a revamped notification shade that lets you snooze incoming alerts. Notification Channels, a related feature, allows you to toggle categories of notifications on a per-app basis \u2014 if you have the YouTube app installed and you only want to see subscription updates from certain channels, for example, you can block notifications from other subscribers. Notification Badges mimic iOS\u2019 unread badge counters \u2014 you\u2019ll see dots appear above an app or folder with new notifications, and tapping or pressing the icon of an app with a dot show it as a pop-up. \nThat is all available on the first-gen Pixel, but not all of the Pixel 2\u2019s software are heading to its predecessor. An upgraded Pixel Launcher (the app that powers the Pixel 2 and first-gen Pixels\u2019 home screens) moves the prominent Google search bar to the bottom of the screen, where it\u2019s easier to reach, and adds an optional \u201cdaily briefing\u201d widget that shows the current weather, temperature, and upcoming calendar entries. \nThe Pixel 2\u2019s other software exclusives take advantage of its custom hardware. The low-power Always On Display shows a monochrome clock and notifications, even when the phone is off. Now Playing taps the Pixel 2\u2019s three-microphone array to identify music playing nearby and put a link a relevant Google Play Music listing on the lock screen. Then there\u2019s Google\u2019s AR Stickers, launching in preview alongside the Pixel 2, which project digital labels onto tables, chairs, and other surfaces. \nThere\u2019s nothing preventing the Pixel from getting many of the Pixel 2\u2019s software features down the line, but one feature it won\u2019t get is the Active Edge, which allows you to squeeze the Pixel 2 to launch Google Assistant or snap a selfie, just like Edge Sense in the HTC U11 . There are enough small extras to hand the Pixel 2 the win. \nWinner: Pixel 2 Price and availability \nGiven all that\u2019s improved in the Pixel 2, you would be forgiven for expecting it to cost an arm and a leg. But it comes in at the same launch price of last year\u2019s Pixel. \nThe Pixel 2 (in \u201cjust black,\u201d\u201cclearly white,\u201d and \u201ckinda blue\u201d colors) is available in 64GB and 128GB storage configurations for $649 and $749 unlocked, respectively \u2014 exactly the same prices as the 2016 Pixel. Alternatively, you can opt for Google\u2019s monthly financing, which is $27.04 per month for the 64GB model and $31.21 per month for the 128GB model. \nFor a limited time, Google\u2019s throwing in the Google Home Mini for customers who pre-order. But there\u2019s a wildcard to consider: The Google Store has the first-gen 32GB Pixel for $550 unlocked, or $100 off the original asking price. \nThe Pixel 2, like last year\u2019s Pixel, is compatible with every major U.S. carrier, but Google has an exclusive retail partnership with Verizon Wireless in the U.S. \nRegardless of carrier, though, Google says it will support the Pixel 2 for three years \u2014 a full year more than the Pixel\u2019s two-year guarantee. \nThe Pixel 2 won\u2019t begin shipping until later this year. But here os the takeaway: It\u2019s a better phone for $100 more than its predecessor, give or take. That is a steep price to swallow, but the durability, speed, and software improvements make the upgrade more than worth it. \nWinner: Pixel 2 Overall winner: Pixel 2 \nThe Pixel 2 is not a massive leap from the Pixel. In many ways, it\u2019s more of an evolution. The design is more or less the same, albeit a bit more durable. The battery life and screen haven\u2019t improved all that much, and the excellent cameras are on a fairly even footing. \nBut what enhancements the Pixel 2 does have are tempting. It\u2019s more durable than the 2016 Pixel, and it\u2019s got a faster processor and stereo speakers. Exclusive software features like the Google Lens and an all-new Pixel Launcher, meanwhile, are icing on the cake. \nWe will have to spend some time with the Pixel 2 before we come to a definitive conclusion, but from what we\u2019ve seen so far, it has the first-generation Pixel beat.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "julian chokkattu/digital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corning", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "google camera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qualcomm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google lens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "verizon wireless", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google home mini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google store", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T02:22:05.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba99f1a60dc02c7f5149dc5af555805b0ef7b89e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXAE_7DCaJzQ1WB6o.FBEx2GhLSgvEn2ouWorFEOPggFCsSpbDFXequBdpQmKK4upUw-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/android/feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Android Army\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Here\u2019s how and where to buy the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL", "title_full": "Here\u2019s how and where to buy the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL", "published": "2017-10-05T00:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/pixel-2-hands-on-black-lock-screen-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 38, "comments": 3, "shares": 38}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba99f1a60dc02c7f5149dc5af555805b0ef7b89e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmB.m7s9UBbNXAE_7DCaJzQ1WB6o.FBEx2GhLSgvEn2ouWorFEOPggFCsSpbDFXequBdpQmKK4upUw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brenda Stolyar", "published": "2017-10-05T00:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here\u2019s how and where to buy the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL", "text": "Google's high-end Pixelbook packs a punch, and it starts at just $1,000 Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: \nBuilding on last year\u2019s bar-setting Google Pixel and Pixel XL , Google unveiled its newest Pixel devices at an October 4 event in San Francisco.

Alongside the launch of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, Google announced the release of a new device called Google Clips . \nAs the name suggests, Google Clips is a small lifelogging camera designed to clip onto objects and record life as it happens, keeping only the best moments for you to save and cherish. \nThe square device weighs just 60.5 grams and measures 49mm, making it roughly the size of similar lifelogging cameras. On the front of the camera is a large, protruding camera lens that captures 130-degree field of view through an f/2.4 aperture. \nAt the heart of the camera is an A.I. engine designed specifically to capture the details of life in the best quality possible. Using machine learning, the camera captures 15 frames per second and pulls out the sharpest, most important details. You can manually sort through the photos it chooses and save the ones you want. \nIt can even learn the faces of people you capture the most and learn to prioritize those particular images. If that thought is a little scary, don\u2019t fret \u2014 all of this processing is done in-camera. \nThe sole button on the device is a large shutter button on the front of the camera. Although Google Clips can stand on its own, there\u2019s a clip case included for mounting the camera on just about anything you can imagine, from the pocket of your shirt to your dog\u2019s collar. \nGoogle Clips has 16GB of onboard storage and files stored on the device can be transferred to Android devices running Android 7.0 Nougat or later using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. \nYou can currently sign up through Google\u2019s online store to be on a waiting list to order Google Clips, which will retail for $250.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T02:22:09.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6a16231385013d5ecabb8fa3d05317aa3ca078ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8Ahfj1DIEamw0eG8muTS0T.7dN1TAqJWv_TJXAwpoxCpmmhZQHFR5DGI55zXrQ5bMn84-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/android/feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Android Army\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Google Home Mini and Google Home Max: Rumors and news", "title_full": "Google Home Mini and Google Home Max: Rumors and news", "published": "2017-10-03T17:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/google-maps-10-4-home-platform-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 31, "comments": 0, "shares": 31}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6a16231385013d5ecabb8fa3d05317aa3ca078ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8Ahfj1DIEamw0eG8muTS0T.7dN1TAqJWv_TJXAwpoxCpmmhZQHFR5DGI55zXrQ5bMn84-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christian de Looper", "published": "2017-10-03T17:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Home Mini and Google Home Max: Rumors and news", "text": "Home > Home > Google Home Mini and Home Max shrinks and\u2026 Google Home Mini and Home Max shrinks and supersizes smart speaker offerings Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Google is taking on the Dot and Sonos with its two new offerings because it really wants you to bring the Home into your house. \nIf you\u2019ve been keeping an eye out for leaks before today\u2019s Google event, then chances are you know a lot about the new Google Home Mini, the puck-like Amazon Echo Dot equivalent, and Google Home Max, a Sonos-esque speaker. The two new additions to the Google Home lineup were formally unveiled at the event, confirming much about what we\u2019d already heard. Google Home Mini \nFirst up is the $49 Google Home Mini. \u201cForm and size really matters for creating that something that actually fits into any room or on any surface,\u201d Isabelle Olsson, Google Home\u2019s lead hardware designer, said at the event. A leaked pre-order page from Walmart (since removed) gave us the dimensions ahead of time: 4.53 by 4.53 by 4.72 inches and weighing less than a pound. A video showcasing the product promised it would be smaller than a doughnut and weigh less than a chipmunk. Four LED lights at the top illuminate when you say \u201cOK, Google,\u201d and you can tap the Mini to pause music, change the volume, or activate Assistant. \nCovered in fabric (available in a pinky-red Coral, a grayish white Chalk, and darker gray Charcoal), the Mini is supposed to project 360-degree sound, but it can wirelessly connect to speakers with Chromecast built in. Like the original Home, you\u2019ll have to plug it in, but it can use Google Assistant in all the same ways: telling you the weather, giving you the day\u2019s events based on your calendar, reciting a story, and so on. Asking it to use the upcoming Broadcast feature, you can turn all your Home devices into intercoms, so you can call your children to dinner. We\u2019ll have to wait to hear if it\u2019s something you\u2019ll want to listen to music on, given its compact size. Google Home Max \nOn the other end of the price and sound spectrum is the $399 Google Home Max. In terms of sound quality, it clearly aims to take on the popular Sonos Play:5 . Google played up the Home Max\u2019s 4.5-inch high-excursions drivers, which indicate the speaker should indeed be able to output generous amounts of bass and play very loud, as Google suggested during its presentation. The bass drivers are accompanied by two tweeters to cover the high frequencies, and all together will be controlled by what sounds like some very advanced digital signal processing (DSP). \nIn most instances, DSP is used to sculpt sound quality to suit the standards of the speaker\u2019s engineering team. That will certainly be the case here, but Google is taking sound-shaping to another level with what it calls Smart Sound \u2014 essentially an ultra-smart EQ system. Google says that Smart Sound will analyze the acoustic properties of the environment it is placed in, and do it in real time. It will use that information to adjust the Home Max\u2019s sound curve to best match the room it is placed in, leveraging thousands of room presets. For example, if the speaker were placed in a room full of glass that tended to over-accentuate high frequencies, it might dial back the treble in a few key frequency bands. Likewise, if it\u2019s in a room with a lot of sound-absorbing materials like carpet and large, overstuffed chairs, it might pump up the bass to keep the low-frequency pulses in balance with the rest of the sound. \nSmart Sound goes a step further, however, and learns different aspects of music listening. As an example, Google said the Home Max could turn the volume down automatically when streaming music in the morning. Conversely, the speaker might play at a high volume with lots of bass on weekend nights in a home that tends to entertain and party on Friday and Saturday evenings. The speaker will also recognize individual voices and play songs that match that user\u2019s musical taste. \nThe Home Max supports most popular streaming music services like Spotify and YouTube music , and for its price of $399 (which comes in under the Sonos Play:5) comes with a 12-month subscription to YouTube Red , which includes YouTube music. \nFor those who wish to connect their own sound sources, like a turntable, personal music player loaded with high-res audio, or television, the Home Max supports both digital and analog audio inputs. The speaker can also be set up in a horizontal or vertical orientation, the latter of which would be ideal if two speakers were to be paired for stereo sound. A moveable magnetic base allows the adjustment. \nYou can pre-order the Home Mini today, and it will hit stores October 19. To get the Home Max, you\u2019ll have to join a waitlist , and those won\u2019t ship until December.

The earbuds are connected to a Bluetooth dongle at the end of the headphone wire, which terminates at about the same spot that the earbud wires converge on the wired version. So, while you\u2019ll still have to deal with some cables, you\u2019ll be untethered from whatever device you\u2019ll be listening to. The dongle houses both the Bluetooth receiver and a battery, which can be charged via micro USB for up to five and a half hours of playback time. \nThe most important point of comparison are the drivers. Like the Xelento Remote, the Xelento Wireless use Tesla transducers, which are made with tiny ring magnets and voice coils designed to offer the same fluid and exquisite audio that we loved in the Xelento Remote. \nWhile it\u2019s one thing to be equipped with high-performance drivers, wireless headphones have to contend with the obstacle of connection quality. It may seem unreliable to use Bluetooth as the transmission method, especially when these headphones are being marketed to the audiophile crowd, but Beyerdynamic is opting for the aptX HD codec (for those with aptX compatible devices), which is designed to enable 24-bit transmission at full resolution (The Xelento Wireless also supports aptX, AAC, and SBC Bluetooth). For those who want the option to listen via wired connection \u2014 or in the event your battery runs out \u2014 the Xelento wireless\u2019 Bluetooth dongle features a 3.5mm jack to plug into. \nConsidering this is a pair of headphones aimed at audiophiles, the Xelento Remote carry a premium price tag. The wired Xelento Remote cost a whopping $1,000, so it\u2019s no surprise that the Xelento wireless will be going for $1,200. Beyerdynamic is launching the headphones at the 2017 Rocky Mountain Audio Fest , which takes place October 6-8 in Denver, Colorado.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "beyerdynamic", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qualcomm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sbc bluetooth", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T02:29:38.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "92012f5ea7a6ee37982330053fe4f97e3f0a528f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8AhecqCdLL1gtuwxtuo4pIZdbdLAOe7LlAeqgwbN2_pT8XYJAquq8JEwx0o1fiUsB0y4-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Home Theater\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Google\u2019s new Pixel Buds earphones are wireless, but not like Apple\u2019s AirPods", "title_full": "Google\u2019s new Pixel Buds earphones are wireless, but not like Apple\u2019s AirPods", "published": "2017-10-04T21:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/pixel-buds-feat-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 249, "comments": 2, "shares": 249}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 21}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92012f5ea7a6ee37982330053fe4f97e3f0a528f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBhP3n.PO8AhecqCdLL1gtuwxtuo4pIZdbdLAOe7LlAeqgwbN2_pT8XYJAquq8JEwx0o1fiUsB0y4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Parker Hall", "published": "2017-10-04T21:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google\u2019s new Pixel Buds earphones are wireless, but not like Apple\u2019s AirPods", "text": "Home > Home Theater > Google\u2019s new Pixel Buds earphones are wireless\u2026 Google\u2019s new Pixel Buds earphones are wireless, but not like Apple\u2019s AirPods   Why it matters to you Google's first crack at wireless earbuds, the Google Pixel Buds, offer some intriguing features, including real-time translation of up to 40 languages. But unlike Apple's Airpods, they aren't fully wireless. \nFollowing the release of its successful smart speaker, Google Home, Google has been digging increasingly deeper into the hardware space. At an event in San Francisco, the tech giant today unveiled several new products, including it new Pixel 2 phones , and a brand new pair of wireless earbuds called the Pixel Buds. \nThe new headphones feature a tethered wireless design, rather than a fully wireless design like Apple\u2019s Airpods , looping a thin cable that connects the two rather bulbous earbuds. In addition to passing sound between the left and right earphones, the cable features a small loop of wire designed to help keep each of the earphones securely in your ears. Like the Pixel 2 phones, the new earbuds will be available in \u201cclearly white\u201d, \u201ckinda blue\u201d, and \u201cjust black.\u201d \nIn terms of functionality, the Pixel Buds will have many of the same hardware features we\u2019ve seen on most Bluetooth in-ear headphones on the market, including touch controls that allow users to tap the right earbud to pause music, as well as swipe forward and backward to change songs. \nGoogle has also integrated the new headphones with other smart features via Google Assistant as soon as you pair the buds with a new Google Pixel device. The most intriguing feature shown is real-time translation via Google Translate, which claims to allow for efficient translation of 40 languages. The company showed the feature in action at the live event, presenting seamless translation between English and Swedish. That said, it\u2019s one thing to do a canned demonstration, and another to translate languages in real-world scenarios. We\u2019ve tried features like this before with inconsistent results, so it will be a real test for Google\u2019s new earphones. \nIn terms of juice, the new headphones will offer a middling five hours of battery life per charge, but that will be supplemented by a wireless charging case that allows for 24 hours of total playback on the go, similar to Apple\u2019s Airpods. \nIt\u2019s perhaps surprising that Google didn\u2019t leap right into the burgeoning fully wireless headphone space, which is currently dominated by the AirPods. That said, many models of fully wireless headphones still struggl e with basic issues like battery life and connectivity, so Google is likely aiming to provide buyers with a more stable, longer-lasting experience. It\u2019s also understandable that Google would take cautious first steps into the headphones space, given how competitive the marketplace is. \nThe Google Pixel Buds will start at an AirPod-matching $159, which will be a serious test considering that there are teems of tethered wireless earbuds currently available at a lower price point. The Pixel Buds can be pre-ordered today on the company\u2019s website , and will ship in 6-7 weeks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google pixel buds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google translate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pixel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T02:29:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e1d29755253e88565bdda8bb87e1a61d7507a82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBaGClvoMMJyM6gwlk3hFL9p7sWp4.UF0pnckzU44BQDr5Ev1OMpO_eK9gthA5H2RNlnk2zELm5P8-", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Computing\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "Samsung Odyssey hands-on review", "title_full": "Samsung Odyssey hands-on review", "published": "2017-10-05T00:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/windows-mixed-reality-headset-samsung-hmd-odyssey-hands-on-11-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 13, "comments": 0, "shares": 13}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e1d29755253e88565bdda8bb87e1a61d7507a82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBaGClvoMMJyM6gwlk3hFL9p7sWp4.UF0pnckzU44BQDr5Ev1OMpO_eK9gthA5H2RNlnk2zELm5P8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nick Mokey", "published": "2017-10-05T00:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Samsung Odyssey hands-on review", "text": "Samsung Odyssey \nWindows Mixed Reality will support five different headsets at launch, which puts would-be buyers into a familiar pickle for any Microsoft fan: Which device should you buy when they all seem more or less the same? \nSamsung offered an easy solution on October 3 when it introduced the Odyssey: Just spend an extra $50 and get the good one. Better in every way \nThe first Mixed Reality headsets Microsoft announced ranged between $350 and $450, and each one boasted the same 1,440 x 1,440 resolution in each eye, and 95-degree field of Vision. Essentially, you\u2019re choosing between a Pontiac Grand Am, an Oldsmobile Alero, and a Chevy Malibu, which is to say: multiple rebadged versions of the same painfully average thing. Sure, the Dell comes in white and the Lenovo in black , but beneath the hood, the same engine\u2019s humming. \nYou\u2019re really more of a sucker not to get it. \nSamsung just pulled a Cadillac with the Odyssey. At $500, it\u2019s undeniably more expensive than any of its peers, but the negligible premium buys you so many important upgrades that you\u2019re really more of a sucker not to get it. \nWhat kind of upgrades? Let\u2019s start with the 1,440 x 1,600 resolution OLED screens. They have more pixels than the competition, and they\u2019re OLED instead of LCD, which means blacker blacks, more vibrant color, and in our experience, silkier motion. Tiny boosts in resolution may be moot point on a 5-inch phone screen these days, where we\u2019re reaching the limits of human perception, but spread across your entire field of view, more pixels matter. First-gen VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive still produce a visible \u201cscreen door effect,\u201d and every extra line of pixels makes it less severe. Nick Mokey/Digital Trends Nick Mokey/Digital Trends Nick Mokey/Digital Trends \nThe Odyssey also has a physical knob to adjust for the difference between your pupils. Yes, the others are \u201cone size fits all\u201d units that only attempt to compensate for differences in human anatomy with software. Only the Samsung allows you to manually adjust the differences between the eye pieces with an easy-to-use knob that you turn until images look their sharpest, like at the eye doctor. It also boasts a 110-degree field of view, which bests the 95 degrees offered by nearly every other competitor \u2014 the Acer headset also features a 110-degree field of view. \nIn practice, the Samsung not only looked sharper than its peers, it produced less of the noticeable haze that appears around bright spots in your peripheral vision in VR goggles, and felt more fluid as we looked around. Maybe that\u2019s the OLED screens. Maybe it\u2019s the 110-degree field of vision. Maybe it\u2019s the manual adjustment. We\u2019re not optical engineers, but we can say without hesitation that Samsung\u2019s headset looks better than any of its peers, particularly when viewing the type of detailed content (like text) that you\u2019re liable to view in Windows Mixed Reality . \nAs if you needed any icing on the VR cake, the Odyssey comes with built-in AKG headphones. These seem like a small detail, particularly if you already own headphones you like, but the convenience of having them built into the headset is greater than you may anticipate. Putting headphones on top of a VR headset means carefully assembling and disrobing a VR ensemble every time you take them on and off. There\u2019s an order of operations to remember, like taking your shoes off before your pants. With the headphones built in, you just take the entire thing on and off. One movement. Nothing to remember.

When we first tackled this topic, in 2013, free-to-play gaming was still in its infancy. Candy Crush Saga was barely a year old, and South Park hadn\u2019t yet lampooned the \u201cpay-to-win\u201d gaming model in 2014\u2019s Freemium Isn\u2019t Free . \nIn the years since, the MMORPG paradigm has shifted. Removing subscription fees and monetizing games via microtransactions and paid expansions has proven to be a successful remodel for MMO publishers. In response to dwindling subscription numbers, which can be attributed simply to the ever-growing number of games out there, many MMO developers have been forced to reduce \u2014 and in many cases, completely remove \u2014 the monthly subscription fees that once powered ultra-popular virtual universes. Zenimax\u2019s The Elder Scrolls Online , for example, launched in 2014 to much ado, then quickly dropped its monthly subscription requirement before releasing to consoles in 2015. It seems like unless your game is named World of Warcraft , the subscription MMO business is dead and buried. \nIf you\u2019re looking to delve into the MMO world for minimal cost, there\u2019s no better time than now. Check out our choices for the best free MMORPGs on the market, so you can hack, slash, and shoot your way through the next six months of your life. \nNote: Most free-to-play games have additional components and unlockables that are only accessible through premium subscriptions and microtransactions, but the free versions still offer a healthy taste of gameplay sans a hefty economical commitment. Also, we\u2019ve only included MMOs that continue to receive updates and support from their developers. RuneScape 3 \nIt\u2019s hard to argue a game isn\u2019t one of the best of its kind when it boasts more than 200 million accounts. Jagex\u2019s Runescape \u2014 now in its third incarnation \u2014 has undergone a series of design and gameplay overhauls since its 2001 debut, garnering the honor of the Most Popular Free MMORPG in existence, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. \nThe latest version of the browser-based MMORPG doesn\u2019t deviate much from previous renditions of the game. Set in the war-torn fantasy realm of Gielinor, Runescape is a simple and familiar take on the MMORPG, laced with a familiar focus on PvE and crafting. Questing and combat are straightforward and often humorous, typically requiring you to click an enemy to death and collect its loot. Thankfully, the bland repetition is offset by the end-game content and the title\u2019s sheer amount of depth. Much of that content remains hidden behind a paid subscription, but even the free content is engaging and fun. \nSimplicity and accessibility are the game\u2019s true strong suits. The game sports a fully-customizable user interface and an engaged community while offering quality voice dialogue and sleek visuals that were recently updated courtesy of the developer\u2019s recent switch from HTML5 to a new C++ engine, called \u201cNXT.\u201d Old content remains available and backward compatible with legacy browsers. Runescape is incredibly rich and doesn\u2019t tax your PC. DC Universe Online \nDC Universe Online dropped its subscription shortly after launch in 2011, but the game still offers as much action-heavy MMO fun now as it did when it was a \u201cpremium\u201d game. Based around the fictional superheroes and villains in the DC Universe, Players begin by either creating a character from scratch or one inspired by famous DC characters such as Superman, Batman, and the like. The rest of the game unfolds in RPG-like fashion, with stereotypical kill-collect quests scattered across Metropolis and Gotham City, and dungeons that break up the standard MMO grind. \nThe well-designed cities, NPCs, and other elements also bask in the kind of comic-esque nuances you\u2019d come to expect from such a title, and although the visuals are nowhere near photo-realistic, they are fittingly stylized. The combat is fast-paced and responsive, too, whether you\u2019re engaging in the game\u2019s heated PvP matches or participating in end-game raids. \nLong-term players can expect a steady stream of ample daily quests and additional endgame content once you blaze through the game and hit the level cap. While the game is not without its faults \u2014 the voice-acting is cringe-worthy at times \u2014 there is no finer MMORPG for comic book fans and those that seek a solid alternative to fantasy-blazoned RPGs like Lord of the Rings Online, and TERA . \nWhat\u2019s more, now is the perfect time to dive into DC Universe Online , as a July update unlocked all content for all players to celebrate Wonder Woman\u2019s 75th birthday. Guild Wars 2 \nWith a 90 on Metacritic and a 90.02 percent rating on GameRankings.com \u2014 second only to World of Warcraft and three of its expansions \u2014 Guild Wars 2 is one of the most critically acclaimed massively multiplayer games of all time. Though it will never unseat Blizzard\u2019s gaming goliath in terms of sheer popularity (or cultural cache), Guild Wars 2 does many things better than World of Warcraft, and without charging a monthly fee. \nGuild Wars \u2018 fluid, unrestrictive combat system provides an excellent counterpart to the rigid, role-based combat that Blizzard began with the Diablo series and built upon with World of Warcraft . Though it lacks the kind of depth and difficulty that forces players to work together in demanding raid environments, the system in Guild Wars 2 encourages players to team up however they see fit \u2014 trying to plow through some difficult PvE content in Guild Wars doesn\u2019t necessarily require a dedicated tank and healer, for instance. The in-game gem store also allows developer ArenaNet to continue profiting off the game and create new content, while simultaneously allowing for new players to jump in at no cost. Rift \nTrion Worlds\u2019 Rift looks and plays like a carbon-copy of World of Warcraft at its core, but who says you have to reinvent the wheel to make a great MMORPG? The game was one of the most stable and expansive MMOs when it launched back in 2011, bursting with striking environments, superbly-crafted character models, and gameplay culled from some of the best aspects of similar titles. Though the early-game quests and lore are drearily dry, the game becomes increasingly more interesting as the story dissipates and you begin closing the sporadic, dimensional rifts that unleash a flurry of demonic beings into the game\u2019s sprawling landscapes. \nRift \u2018s best feature is a flexible and immersive class system. Players begin by choosing one of two opposing factions \u2014 either the Guardians or Defiant \u2014 followed by one of three races and a standard archetype such as a mage, rogue, cleric, or warrior. Additionally, players take on three souls at a time, which function like subclasses, and develop their character using an elaborate skill tree. This level of customization adds to the game\u2019s strategy and makes the accompanying co-op dungeons that much more dynamic and intriguing. The learning curve is steep, even after level 50, but the originality is all there\u2026 assuming you can look past the elements cribbed from other titles. \nWhile Trion Worlds has supplied a steady stream of free content for Rift since the game went free-to-play in 2013, the game will be getting its first piece of premium DLC, an expansion titled Starfall Prophecy, which releases Fall 2016. Starfall Prophecy will add a host of new content, including new areas, dungeons, a raised level cap, and updated gameplay features that will only be available to players who purchase the expansion. The base game and all previous updates will still remain free-to-play, however, so if you don\u2019t mind missing out on the newest content, you can play Rift as much as you like without paying a penny. Star Wars: The Old Republic \nAny game built into the Star Wars universe is a massive undertaking considering the legion of devotees and die-hard fanatics that possess an attachment to the material. Luckily, BioWare\u2019s subscription-turned-free-to-play title set in the Old Republic timeline \u2014 i.e. thousands of years before the movies \u2014 is both easily accessible and instantly recognizable. The writing and fully-voiced dialogue is excellent, bolstered by class-specific narratives and a wealth of contextual backstory that any fan of the franchise will admire. The visuals still hold up fairly well, and users can easily customize graphics settings to fit a broad range of gaming rigs. The gameplay mechanics are also rooted in real-time, hotkey-based combat, and offer additional variation in the form of on-rails space combat and PvP warzones. \nDespite the multiplayer functionality, SWTOR is also an enjoyable solo experience. Players choose from one of two factions, either the Republic or the Empire, and select from one of four distinct character classes specific to each side of the force. If you choose the Republic, you\u2019ll have access to the smuggler, trooper, Jedi Knight, and Jedi Consular, while the Empire provides options to be a bounty hunter, Sith warrior, Imperial agent, and Sith Inquisitor. The story-driven flashpoints, SWTOR \u2018s equivalent to co-op dungeons, offer some of the most rewarding and challenging gameplay in the entire Star Wars universe, throwing players at drifting Republic warships and distant Imperial prisons as they battle alongside others in an effort to complete the designated objectives in exchange for valuable loot. \nThough SWTOR has been out for more than five years, BioWare keeps churning out new content and released Knights of the Eternal Throne in late 2016. And while the game has undergone considerable changes since its switch to free-to-play \u2014 both good and bad \u2014 it remains an incredibly vibrant branch of the Star Wars universe. Read our initial review . TERA \nLike the aforementioned Rift , TERA isn\u2019t going to set the world on fire with refreshing gameplay or revolutionary ideas. Yet what it does, it does exceptionally well, setting the stage for one of the most dynamic and pleasing combat systems in MMORPG history. Like TERA \u2018s counterparts, the game offers a diverse assortment of characters and classes \u2014 from the giant-bred Amani to the adorable Popori \u2014 each of which is accompanied by a familiar set of classes available to all races. The environments are dazzling and bright, with lush vistas and sprawling plains, and the character models are a joy to look at no matter what your machine\u2019s graphics settings call for. \nWhile the general questing-and-crafting gameplay in the early hours of TERA are standard fare, but the aforementioned combat mechanics which feels incredibly dynamic and different compared to the stand-still combat that characterizes most MMORPGs. The game requires the player to engage in a variety of fleet-footed maneuvers as they dodge and jab at opponents: The result feels more like a third-person action game than a hotkey-heavy WoW -style affair. Hunting and eradicating \u201cbig-ass monsters\u201d alongside a group of fellow players is exhilarating, as are the group dungeons, but the events and quests are all loosely connected by a story arc that barely qualifies as mundane. However, additional components, such as in-game elections and open-world PvP, add enough individual flair to make TERA a world all its own. \nA massive 2014 update increased the level cap from 60 to 65 and added several new zones, all for free. Last year saw the addition of two new playable classes, while smaller updates continue to roll out regularly, including new dungeons, battlegrounds, and skills for each of the game\u2019s 11 classes. That said, TERA still has one of the most active gaming communities of any MMO, mostly due to strong support from the game\u2019s developers. The Lord of the Rings Online \nLike SWTOR , the world surrounding that of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s Middle Earth has been one hugely solidified in popular culture thanks to Peter Jackson\u2019s feature-length films. Fortunately, Lord of the Rings Online contains a wealth of content from Tolkien\u2019s work, stuff that Jackson\u2019s films never touched, and its cartoonish visuals color the rich environments of Middle Earth. The places you\u2019ll visit are as diverse and eclectic as they are in the various books, ranging from snow-topped peaks to rolling hills, and the creation tools allow players to tackle the story as a hobbit, human, dwarf, or elf. Classes are as equally diverse, ranging from burglar and hunter to lore-keeper and guardian, but the selection is specific your race. \nWith four expansions out the door and more on the way, the game has undergone substantial changes since its initial release in 2007, yet the core mechanics and gameplay remain roughly the same. The storyline is still epic, driving players through familiar spaces filled with recognizable figures from both the books and films, and the overall narrative gives otherwise bland quests substantial, contextual weight. Character progression and PvP combat is limited, but additional elements like deeds and Monster Play \u2014 which essentially allows you to play in the role of one of Sauron\u2019s minions \u2014 add greater depth to the game\u2019s seemingly straightforward approach. LOTRO is often dubbed a World of Warcraft ripoff, and perhaps it is in many ways, but it\u2019s a hard argument to make when so much of the latter MMORPG was likely inspired by the world engulfing the former. Neverwinter \nDeveloper Cryptic Studios combined the simplicity and combat-focused gameplay of Diablo with a more traditional fantasy setting to create Neverwinter , based upon lore from the Dungeons & Dragons universe. The combat system utilizes a computerized version of D&D\u2019s 4th Edition by rolling imaginary dice to determine hits, misses, and damage dealt. The game, initially released in 2013 for PC and 2015 for the Xbox One, features 10 PvE campaigns and one dedicated PvP campaign for players to experience. Though the game assumes a linear approach, the fluid, Darksiders -esque combat feels fresh \u2014 especially for Xbox One, where the game\u2019s aversion to social interaction and traditional RPG elements feels less oppressive. \nThough the game\u2019s performance can tank if you\u2019re in high-level zones on an Xbox or a low-end PC, the game features excellent spell effects and sound design, two underrated aspects of fantasy games that can be make-or-break your immersion in the experience. Though some of the game\u2019s systems, such as its lack of communication channels and an insanely expensive in-game store, seem poorly executed. Even with those faults, though, Neverwinter is a fast-paced game that provides a different feel relative to most of the MMOs on our list. Dungeons and Dragons Online \nFor most of us, Dungeons and Dragons has always been the tabletop game we kept to ourselves in fear of being ostracized (no shame there). However, despite DDO \u2018s launch woes and flawed beginnings, the sun-dappled city of Stormreach has never been so appealing. Loosely based on the D&D 3.5 ruleset, DDO is a game with extensive customization directly built into the framework. Featuring more classes than any other title on our list, the character creation tools allow players to experiment with a dynamic multiclass system wherein your character can effortlessly combine facets of skillsets. Although the latest updates still heavily cater toward group instances and the game\u2019s rooted emphasis in tight-knit teamwork, solo options are becoming exceedingly robust, especially if you can afford to pick up an NPC \u201chireling\u201d or two to back you up. \nLet\u2019s be honest, though: DDO , which launched in 2006, doesn\u2019t hold up when compared to newer, oft-updated titles, particularly in terms of visual fidelity. While it isn\u2019t an eyesore, the game doesn\u2019t pack the polygonal depth and vibrant details of newer MMOs like Tera . The game behind the visuals, however, is captivating, fueled by story-driven raids and dungeons whirling around the never-ending defense of Stormreach. Aion Online \nWith titles like City of Heroes and the first Guild Wars under its belt, Korean developer NCSoft knows its way around an MMORPG. Aion is a tightly-polished effort, rooted in a post-cataclysm world that\u2019s been torn asunder by two warring races. Players begin by selecting the hardy Asmodians or the radiant Elyos \u2014 each with four distinct classes that are subdivided into two more once you reach level 10 \u2014 and are then thrust into the stunning environments of Atreia. The questing and six crafting systems are linear, often requiring you to grind between lulls and recruit other players for the more populated zones. \nAion \u2018s true calling lies in it\u2019s ability to balance both PvE and PvP components. Once players hit level 25, they can enter the Abyss, a PvPvE battleground in which opposing factions battle for control over fortresses. Combat is fast-paced and responsive, reliant on chain attacks and fair amounts of button mashing, and incorporates flying mechanics that are truly unique to the genre. Although most regions outside the Abyss are designated as no-fly zones, players can still glide within the regions from any elevated jump-off point. Flying in the Abyss is also limited, but the added component provides an entirely new dimension to think about while in combat since you constantly need to be aware of what\u2019s going on at various elevations before you become exhausted and fall from the sky. Aion is an immediately enjoyable and beautiful title from the get-go, even if it does take you a while to earn your wings. Honorable mention \u2014 Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn \nFinal Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is a bit different than other entries on our list, as it isn\u2019t fully \u201cfree-to-play.\u201d Originally, the 2013 MMO featured a 14-day trial period for new users. In 2016, though, Square Enix nixed the time restriction and gave players free reign of the continent of Eorzea until they reach level 35. Make no mistake, though, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is one of the best MMOs available today. It stands tall as a love letter to series fans who were almost universally disappointed in its predecessor Final Fantasy XIV . And the journey to level 35, well, it\u2019s bound to sink its teeth in and draw you into its beautiful and engaging world. \nAvailable on PlayStation 4 and PC, A Realm Reborn tells a fairly traditional Final Fantasy narrative \u2014 the pursuit of thwarting a nefarious evil that threatens the well being of the people. Despite this, cut scenes are implemented smartly and certainly draw you in to care about the world. \nMechanically, A Realm Reborn stands out thanks to its diversified class and quest systems. Classes are dictated by the gear that your character holds, so you can switch your class with ease. Within the level 35 cap, you will be able to further advance your primary and secondary classes into jobs which unlock even more specialized traits. The quests mix from epic adventures to shorter fetch quests across the vast lands. Trial players can wade through the first 10 levels of the constantly changing test of strength that is the Deep Dungeon, and they can also head over to the Gold Saucer for Chocobo Racing and Triple Triad, a card game that originally appeared in Final Fantasy VIII . \nFans of traditional MMOs will find much to love throughout the journey to level 35 and if you get hooked enough to pay for a subscription, just know that the game\u2019s delights ramp up from level 35 to the level 50 cap. \nUpdate: Added Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:07:45.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4a07c0ec93432a5d3bc549aade51fceb40cede8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz7tjfNWJW4r3PDpsITrEV8LrH2EWgCJfvKY4eS7UI3g3y.pP4SFuHQk", "site_full": "www.digitaltrends.com", "site": "digitaltrends.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/feed/", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Computing\u2013Digital Trends", "title": "The best gaming desktop you can buy", "title_full": "The best gaming desktop you can buy", "published": "2017-10-04T22:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/digital-storm-velox-main-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg?ver=1", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 1067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 232, "comments": 6, "shares": 232}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 7}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4a07c0ec93432a5d3bc549aade51fceb40cede8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZCZo9Q1DrPGnRIhKmERmBukCaNF8wIz7tjfNWJW4r3PDpsITrEV8LrH2EWgCJfvKY4eS7UI3g3y.pP4SFuHQk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jayce Wagner", "published": "2017-10-04T22:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "The best gaming desktop you can buy", "text": "Who it\u2019s for: Budget-minded gamers who want a slick gaming rig \nHow much will it cost: Starts at $650, tested at $950 \nWhy we picked the Dell Inspiron 5675 \nNot everyone wants (or is able) to spend thousands on a gaming PC. Luckily, there are potent options out there for even the most frugal gamers, and Dell\u2019s Inspiron 5675 is at the top of the list. \nIf you\u2019re a fiend for gorgeous graphics, you can find better options, but few \u2014 if any \u2014 desktops offer the same level of power as the Inspiron for such a reasonable price. At 1080p, but it\u2019ll play demanding games like Battlefield 1 without breaking a sweat. \nIn Battlefield 1 , the Inspiron and its RX 580 never dipped below 60 FPS at 1440p, even at ultra-high detail settings. To be fair though, our review unit wasn\u2019t the basic $650 model , but a slightly upgraded model which retails for $950. Either way, it\u2019s still an exceptionally capable machine at a bargain basement price. \nThe Dell Inspiron 5675 is a solid performer with a few drawbacks, but its low price and solid gaming performance make it a good choice, especially if you\u2019re looking to step into the world of PC gaming for the first time.

The laptop is HP\u2019s first enterprise Ultrabook with docking capability, making it great for business elites who want to stay productive anywhere they go. \nThe enterprise laptop packs a third-generation Intel Core processor giving you ultimate control, security, and remote manageability. At just 0.75-inches thick, it\u2019s the thinnest EliteBook to date, yet it gives you a 14-inch (355.6 mm) diagonal display providing all the mobility you need. It has VGA , DisplayPort, Ethernet , and three USB 3.0 ports so you can be more efficient wherever you take it. \nWe got our hands on an HP EliteBook Folio 9470M and found its slimness and number of ports to be huge pluses, along with the user-removable battery that doesn\u2019t jet out and the pointstick and touchpad with discrete mouse buttons. We also confirmed that the laptop remains fairly quiet when not connected to the AC adapter and when hooked up with the fan running constantly, noise levels aren\u2019t that noticeable even in quiet environments. We concluded that if ports and a removable battery are high on your list, you should definitely consider this HP model. \nIn testing, we found that under normal usage, you can probably get about seven and a half hours or more of battery life and if that\u2019s not enough you can carry another battery and easily swap it out yourself. It has a generous touchpad and two sets of mouse buttons. Because you get distinct left and right mouse buttons, the design helps prevent issues with finger misplacement and accidental multitouch gesture activation. Additionally, if you\u2019d rather use the pointstick for navigation, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s precise and easy to use. \nYou can keep the computer and your documents fully protected with a full set of EliteBook business software and anti-virus protection, which are automatically preloaded including HP Client Security and HP BIOS Vault .
