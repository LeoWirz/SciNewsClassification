top policy team amid ongoing EU antitrust row \nPrime Minister Theresa May set out her quest to tackle social and racial injustice on Tuesday, hoping to shift the focus of her Conservative party\u2019s annual conference away from rifts over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and her leadership. \nAfter a bruising start to the party\u2019s annual meeting in the city of Manchester, May will try to reset the agenda after remarks on Brexit policy by foreign minister Boris Johnson that deepened divisions in her top team of advisers. \nShe said an audit will be published on Oct. 10 spelling out the \u201cuncomfortable truths\u201d of life in Britain, showing how people of different racial backgrounds are treated in the health, education, employment and the criminal justice system. \nHer ministers will also announce policies to try to prove critics wrong and show that her government is working, including measures to toughen sentences of people streaming or browsing extremist material, and to increase nurse training. \n\u201cIn doing this ground-breaking work we are holding a mirror up to our society,\u201d May said in a statement. \n\u201cMy most fundamental political belief is that how far you go in life should be based on your talent and how hard you work \u2013 and nothing else.\u201d \nBut in early morning broadcast interviews, May was repeatedly asked about her relationship with Johnson after he set out four personal red lines for the Brexit negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union. \n\u201cI don\u2019t set red lines,\u201d May told BBC television, describing her cabinet of top ministers as united over Brexit. \n\u201cLeadership is about ensuring that you have a team of people who aren\u2019t yes men, but a team of people of different voices around the table so that we can discuss matters, come to an agreement and then put that government view forward, and that is exactly what we\u2019ve done.\u201d \nMay promised to build a \u201ccountry that works for everyone, not just the privileged few\u201d when she became prime minister just over a year ago after Britons voted narrowly to leave the EU and her predecessor David Cameron stepped down. \nBut she has had to shelve many of her domestic policies \u2013 such as social care and corporate reforms \u2013 since losing the Conservatives\u2019 majority in parliament in a June election. That setback has undermined the party\u2019s confidence in her ability to lead it into the next election, due in 2022. \nThe preliminary findings of the audit showed that the unemployment rate for black, Asian and minority ethnic people of working age is nearly double that for white groups, while more than nine in 10 headteachers are white, the government said. \nThe findings, the government says, can help better target training and mentoring programmes. \n\u201cThe idea itself is not new,\u201d May said. \n\u201cCharles Booth\u2019s maps of rich and poor areas in Victorian London drew attention to hardship that was too often hidden \u2013 but this focus on how ethnicity affects people\u2019s lives will present findings that are uncomfortable.\u201d For all the latest World News , download Indian Express App More Related News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "david cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles booth", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:52:52.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d1a509932d65e216c733305a2b31133af8abcb5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOWvWECmUc642L._wBww_Cqh8IooCu39S7t.U1pUA4d8ndOhfB94ukSuW_dlQEIFJFHiL1weEntWyMddhADtdxyb6TItQDKRSw-", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/world/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "World \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "Russia threatens relation over U.S. \u2018break-in\u2019 at San Francisco consulate", "title_full": "Russia threatens relation over U.S. \u2018break-in\u2019 at San Francisco consulate", "published": "2017-10-03T13:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/09/us-russia-759.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 39, "comments": 0, "shares": 39}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d1a509932d65e216c733305a2b31133af8abcb5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOWvWECmUc642L._wBww_Cqh8IooCu39S7t.U1pUA4d8ndOhfB94ukSuW_dlQEIFJFHiL1weEntWyMddhADtdxyb6TItQDKRSw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T13:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russia threatens relation over U.S. \u2018break-in\u2019 at San Francisco consulate", "text": "Amazon Great Indian Festival sale: Apple iPhone 8 to Redmi 4, here are top tech deals \nU.S. officials broke into residences at Russia\u2019s consulate in San Francisco, the foreign ministry in Moscow said, threatening retaliation over what it called a hostile and illegal act. Russian staff had left the consulate last month, after Washington ordered Moscow to vacate some of its diplomatic properties, part of a series of tit-for-tat actions during a thorny phase in bilateral relations. \nSince then, U.S. officials had occupied administrative parts of the compound but on Monday they entered residential areas that the departing staff had locked, the ministry said in a statement late on Monday. \u201cDespite our warnings, the U.S. authorities did not listen to reason and did not give up their illegal intentions,\u201d it said. \u201c\u2026We reserve the right to respond. The principle of reciprocity has always been and remains the cornerstone of diplomacy.\u201d \nFootage aired repeatedly on Russian state television showed what the broadcaster said were U.S. officials breaking locks that had sealed off parts of the compound and entering the buildings. The \u201cintruders\u201d had taken over the whole premises including the consul general\u2019s residence, the ministry said. \n\u201cTherefore, we understand that Americans, breaking into our diplomatic buildings, have de facto agreed that their missions in Russia may be treated likewise.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin last month accused Washington of \u201cboorish\u201d treatment of Russia\u2019s diplomatic premises on U.S. soil, ordering the foreign ministry to take legal action over alleged violations of Russia\u2019s property rights. \nThe tit-for-tat began late last year when former U.S. president Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for alleged Russian meddling in the election that took Donald Trump to the White House. Trump took office in January, saying he wanted to improve ties with Russia, while Putin also spoke favourably of Trump. \nBut the allegations of interference in the vote, which Moscow has denied, have persisted as an investigation by U.S. authorities has widened. In July, Moscow ordered the United States to cut the number of its diplomatic and technical staff working in Russia by around 60 percent, to 455.

Show them that you mean business by speaking out or even terminating your NRA membership. Show that you care about your fellow Americans,\u201d she said. \nShe added: \u201cAct now. Enough is enough.\u201d \nThe Las Vegas shooting on Sunday night, in which at least 59 people were killed and more than 500 wounded, has rekindled the debate on gun control laws in the US. \nNearly 12,000 Americans have been killed by guns in 273 mass shootings in 2017 so far \u2013 one incident for each day, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit corporation that tracks gun-related violence in the US. \nOn an average, more than 90 Americans lose their lives to gun violence every day, a daily toll of heartbreak and tragedy in communities across the US. \nOther Indian-American Congressmen too joined Jayapal in condemning the incident. \nNo community should have to fear going to the movies, a concert, or dropping their child off at school, said Ami Bera, the three-term Congressman from California. \n\u201cIn the wake of this tragedy, I hope we\u2019ll all be able to take the time to look for the helpers and that each of us, in our own way, will seek to help our nation heal, move forward, and work to prevent similar tragedies,\u201d Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat Congressman from 8th district Illinois, said. \n\u201cWe must end this senseless violence,\u201d said Congressman Ro Khanna, Democrat Congressman from 17th district California. \nIn a statement, UNITED SIKHS condemned the \u201csenseless act\u201d of terror. \nIts volunteers have teamed with Gurdwaras, where shelter, hot meals (langar) and other assistance is being offered to all who may need it. \nSikh taxi drivers are volunteering to drive people to their destinations safely, it said.

The airline declared bankruptcy on Monday after failing to secure fresh capital or sell the business, leaving British authorities racing to rescue tens of thousands of customers stranded abroad, while Monarch staff were made redundant. \n\u201cYesterday was a heart-breaking day as 2,000 people lost their jobs and we are all absolutely devastated for the customers and for all of us,\u201d Swaffield told BBC Radio 4. \nThe Civil Aviation Authority regulator launched an emergency repatriation scheme on Monday to fly back 110,000 Monarch customers to Britain at an estimated cost to taxpayers of \u00a360 million. Monarch has been badly hit by a legacy of weak demand in previously key markets Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt that have each suffered terrorist attacks in recent years. In turn, the events have sparked fierce competition and oversupply for popular destinations Portugal and Spain. \nConsequently, the airline suffered a 25-percent reduction in ticket prices which created a \u201cmassive economic challenge\u201d for the group, Swaffield said.

But to migrating birds, they\u2019re a potentially fatal attraction, according to a scientific study published Monday. \nDuring the seven-year study at National September 11 Memorial and Museum, researchers noticed thousands of birds were drawn to the annual light display, causing them to waste precious energy circling and calling and risking collisions with buildings or capture by predators. \nIn 2015, for example, the count of birds within a half-kilometer (0.3 miles) of the tribute sight went from 500 to 15,700 within a half hour of the lights coming on. And when the lights were turned off, the birds went on their way within minutes. \n\u201cMigrating is already hard enough for birds without this added danger from artificial light at night,\u201d said Susan Elbin, of New York City Audubon, co-author with researchers from Oxford University and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. \nTheir study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, estimates that the light beams influenced more than a million birds _ including warblers, thrushes and sparrows _over seven years of the one-night tributes. \nResearchers said they could not get an accurate count of how many birds actually died since some of them fell onto scaffolding, were snatched by scavengers or disposed of by maintenance workers. \nMost bird migration occurs at night, and billions of birds move through increasingly light-polluted skies. The authors recommend bright lights around homes, stadiums, offshore oil rigs and construction sites be turned off as much as possible during migration season, especially from midnight to dawn. \nUnder a protocol established in 2002 to prevent harm to migrating birds, the tribute lights representing the fallen Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are turned off for 20 minutes whenever more than 1,000 birds are seen circling or flying dangerously low with frequent calling. The interludes of darkness allowed scientists to quantify changes in bird behavior. \nThe birds were counted by more than 20 volunteers. Data from National Weather Service radar helped document the density and movements of birds, and acoustic monitors recorded vocalizations. \nWhile researchers have known for more than 60 years that that powerful lights pointed at the sky attract birds, this study is useful for quantifying how far away birds are being attracted, said Travis Longcore, assistant professor of architecture, spatial sciences and biological sciences at the University of Southern California \nWhen you put up a tall tower or a tall building or lights that you shine straight up in the sky, you\u2019re not just affecting the birds that might fly over just that spot anyway. \u2026 But we\u2019re changing migratory pathways to actually encounter these obstructions,\u201d said Longcore, who was not involved in the study.

The Export-Import Bank of China (China Exim Bank) has signed an agreement with CRCC to provide 200-billion-yuan (about USD 30 billion) to enable it aggressively market its technology abroad. \nThe bank will offer CRCC a wide range of financial services, including credit support and information counselling, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. China has identified its bullet train technology as one of the items to boost its sagging exports. \nThrough the move, the China Exim Bank hopes to help the CRCC increase its core competitiveness in railway engineering and equipment manufacturing, and encourage outbound cooperation, the report said. \nIn recent years, Chinese enterprises have been quickening their pace of \u201cgoing global\u201d, and have gained a strong competitive edge in the area of railway construction. China, which recently increased the speed of its bullet train to 350 kms, has the world\u2019s longest high-speed rail network with 22,000 kms currently in operation. \nIt is now trying hard to market it abroad including in India.

The ongoing flight, that has already seen over 500,000 Rohingya enter Bangladesh since last month, casts doubt on the practicality of a Myanmar proposal aired on Monday to begin repatriation of the Muslim minority. \nRakhine state has been emptied of half of its Rohingya population in weeks, and more are on the move as insecurity presses them to leave villages which have so far been spared the worst of the communal violence to rip through the state. Over \u201c10,000 Muslims are arriving at the western grove between Letphwekya and Kwunthpin village to emigrate to the neighbouring country,\u201d the state-backed Global new Light of Myanmar reported today. \nMyanmar\u2019s government refuses to recognise the Rohingya as a distinct ethnic group, instead calling them \u201cMuslims\u201d or \u201cBengalis\u201d\u2014 code for illegal migrants. Authorities have tried to reassure fleeing Rohingya that they are now safe in Rakhine, the report added, but they want to leave \u201cof their own accord.\u201d \nVillagers are running short on food, while fear in ethnic Rakhine-majority areas has been kindled by the violence and reports of death threats by their Buddhist neighbours. \u201cIn some villages they are scared to pass by Rakhine villages,\u201d said Chris Lewa, from Rohingya advocacy group the Arakan project, told AFP. On occasions when the Rohingya village chief decides to leave, the whole hamlet will follow, emptying a village \u201cin just a few hours.\u201d \nOn Monday, Myanmar\u2019s Minister of the Office of State Counselor, Kyaw Tint Swe, told Bangladesh his country was ready to return refugees subject to a verification process agreed in the early 1990s by the neighbours. Under that agreement nearly a quarter of a million Rohingya were repatriated from Bangladesh to Myanmar between the early 1990s and 2005, he explained. \nBut refugees and rights groups say the verification process relies on documents most Rohingya do not have. The refugees also are also deeply fearful of what awaits back in Myanmar, with many recounting stories of rape, murder and arson. Inside Rakhine, conditions are deteriorating for those left behind. \nUN officials toured a conflict-hit portion of the state on Monday, noting the \u201cunimaginable\u201d scale of suffering. An EU delegation accompanying them on the government-steered day trip urged for an end to the violence after seeing \u201cvillages burned to the ground and emptied of inhabitants.\u201d For all the latest World News , download Indian Express App More Related News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris lewa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyaw tint swe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohingya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohingya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buddhist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of state counselor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "myanmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "letphwekya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwunthpin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arakan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohingya village", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rakhine", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:53:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ed42e214f63724f3a0ae38f0619c9e9e56b3687", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qPxXD.nJkRJ_D2ozID70DiM3hpAjk1umUnCnoArhfAZf9eod2lSwOwzRKcFACodj4ovISI2BGVjzY96sLTfRRpq", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/india/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "India \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "Second reach of Kochi Metro commissioned", "title_full": "Second reach of Kochi Metro commissioned", "published": "2017-10-03T13:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/06/nh07kochimetro-759-1.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ed42e214f63724f3a0ae38f0619c9e9e56b3687", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qPxXD.nJkRJ_D2ozID70DiM3hpAjk1umUnCnoArhfAZf9eod2lSwOwzRKcFACodj4ovISI2BGVjzY96sLTfRRpq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T13:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Second reach of Kochi Metro commissioned", "text": "After Kochi Metro, can other Tier II cities go the extra mile to finish projects on time? \nThe second reach of Kochi Metro from Palarivattom to Maharaja\u2019s College ground in the heart of the city was commissioned on Tuesday by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the presence of Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.

Hailing the Right to Information Act (RTI) as a \u201cgreat success story\u201d, Habibullah added that there were still challenges in the implementation of the 12-year-old law. \nThe absence of updated information on websites by ministries, both at the central and state level, and the maintenance of autonomy and independence of the Central Information Commission and information commissions in states were some of the challenges, the former CIC told PTI. \nUnder the RTI Act, Habibullah said, it is expected that every ministry and department under the Centre or state government should not only develop a website but also ensure that it contains a host of routine information. The websites are there and a lot of information is there but that \u201cinformation is unfortunately out of date\u201d, he said. \nEvery ministry must be \u201ccompelled\u201d to disclose all this information which can be disclosed legally, he said. The government should set up an authority to supervise ministries in declaring all disclosable information on their own, the 72 -year-old former bureaucrat said. \nHabibullah, who was CIC for nearly five years from 2005, said, \u201cUnfortunately, the law itself carries no clause for enforcement of section 4 (of the RTI Act) which talks of computerisation of all records. There is no authority to actually enforce it, the information commission can advise but cannot enforce it.\u201d \nAnother challenge for the RTI, he asserted, was that information commissions were expected to \u201cstand alone\u201d and supposed to be not only autonomous in their functioning but also independent in their decision making. \u201cThey take no dictates from the government. Unfortunately, that (independence and autonomy) has not happened,\u201d he said, adding that the performance of the Central Information Commission on this front had been much better than commissions in the states. \nAsked how the government could influence commissions, Habibullah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had himself mentioned a way out. The prime minister has said the government should treat RTI as an instrument by which it can improve itself, he noted and suggested that every ministry should have a group or a team that vets the type of information that is sought. It will give the government a clear indication of the areas of concern, he said. \n\u201cThe PM put his finger on it. Unfortunately, nothing much has happened so far, (but) since the PM himself is behind it, activists, commissioners, people working within the establishment, should work together in making this a reality,\u201d he said. Asked whether RTI was being misused by some people and was, in certain cases, putting a burden on government departments, Habibullah said there was some truth in that argument. \n\u201cWhen I was the CIC, I myself would dismiss any complaints of its misuse, saying it was being misused because of the lack of information you are putting out. If you put out all the information there is no question of misuse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that we (establishment) are not taking the trouble of suo motu disclosing information which is disclosable under the act and unnecessarily applying the Official Secrets Act where it is not really applicable, we have made it more difficult for ourselves,\u201d he added.

The Senate voted on a bitterly divided partisan lines to confirm Pai\u2019s nomination for his second five-year term. The FCC is an independent agency created by Congressional statute to regulate interstate communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and US territories. \nThe vote was 52-41 for 44-year-old Pai, who has served as a commissioner at the FCC since 2012. He is the first Indian American to hold this post. Speaking on the Senate floor against Pai, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer alleged that during his tenure as acting FCC Chairman, he has established a clear record of favouring big corporations at the expense of consumers, innovators and small businesses. Pai, he alleged, supported Congressional attempts to reverse the FCC\u2019s 2016 broadband privacy rule, which would have prevented big cable and internet companies from profiting off of personal internet data. \nNow, internet service providers no longer have to obtain consumer consent before they sell or share sensitive personal data, he rued. \u201cMost disturbingly, Pai is currently attempting to dismantle the Open Internet Order, the net neutrality rules under which millions of consumers currently have access to a free and open internet,\u201d Schumer alleged. Pai, however defended his work. \u201cSince January, the Commission has focused on bridging the digital divide, promoting innovation, protecting consumers and public safety, and making the FCC more open and transparent,\u201d he said. Several lawmakers agreed with him. \nPai has focused on the expansion of rural broadband and acceleration of next generation infrastructure deployment. In defense of Pai, Republican Sen Roger Wicker said he is \u201cworking to establish the light-touch regulatory framework that allowed the internet to become the marvel of the modern age, keeping it free and open for consumers, innovators and providers. Internet technology will continue to thrive if we keep the heavy hand of government away from the controls.\u201d Pai understands communications policy from just about every angle \u2014 no wonder, given his deep and impressive resume, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (File Photo) \nSenator John Thune, chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, said, \u201cIn recent weeks, Pai has worked tirelessly to help ensure communications services are restored to the communities affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.\u201d In just nine months since becoming Chairman, Pai has also made much-needed reforms to improve transparency at the FCC and to improve the agency\u2019s processes, he said. Senator Shelley Moore Capito said Pai truly understands the need to bring more rural communities online and has shown a real commitment to closing the digital divide in America. \nPai understands communications policy from just about every angle \u2014 no wonder, given his deep and impressive resume, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He comprehends the needs of rural communities in states like mine \u2014 a product of his own rural upbringing, he said. However, Senator Blumenthal alleged that Pai has taken one step after another that are contrary to the public interest. \nHe has launched an attack on net neutrality, and is working adamantly toward undoing the open internet order, the lawmaker charged. Pai forcefully advocated in support of efforts to rescind the FCC\u2019s broadband privacy rules \u2013 a blatant attack on consumer privacy rights, all the more striking in light of recent concerns about privacy, he said. \u201cSigning up for the internet should not mean that you have to sign away your rights to privacy. Chairman Pai has raised severe doubts about his commitment to the average American consumer,\u201d Blumenthal said. \nSoon after becoming the president, Trump designated Pai as acting Chairman of Federal Communications. He had previously served as Commissioner at FCC. Appointed by his predecessor Barack Obama , Pai was confirmed unanimously by the Senate in May 2012. Before joining FCC, Pai was a Partner at Jenner & Block, LLP from 2011 until 2012, and Deputy General Counsel, Associate General Counsel, and Special Advisor to the General Counsel at the FCC from 2007 until 2011. \nThe son of immigrants from India, Pai grew up in Parsons, Kansas.

The Detroit automaker is promising two new EVs loosely based on the Chevrolet Bolt in the next 1 \u00bd years and more than 20 electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2023. The company sees its entire model lineup running on electricity in the future, whether the source is a big battery or a tank full of hydrogen. \n\u201cWe are far along in our plan to lead the way into that future world,\u201d product development chief Mark Reuss said Monday at a news conference at the GM technical center north of Detroit. The event was billed as a \u201csneak peek\u201d into GM\u2019s electric future. The company also pledged to start producing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for commercial or military use in 2020. And it promised an increase in the number of electric fast-charging stations in the US, which now total 1,100 from companies and governments, taking a shot at electric competitor Tesla Inc by saying the system would not be \u201cwalled off\u201d from electric vehicles made by other manufacturers. \nTesla has 951 fast-charging stations globally that can only be used by Tesla owners. The news helped push GM\u2019s stock up 4.4 percent to a record closing price of $42.16 on Monday, besting the old high of $40.99 set on December 20, 2013. The hastily called event was short on specifics, and it came just a day before the CEO of Ford Motor Co, GM\u2019s prime competitor, was to announce its business plan that likely will include electric and autonomous vehicles as priorities. \nThe two new GM electrics in the immediate future likely will be SUVs or a sportier car designed to compete with Tesla\u2019s upcoming Model 3 sedan, Reuss said. The Model 3, which is now in the early stages of production, will go hood-to-hood with the Bolt, starting around $35,000 (excluding a $7,500 federal tax credit) with a range of over 200 miles. The Bolt starts at $37,495 excluding the credit. \nBehind Reuss and other executives were nine vehicles covered with tarps that the company said were among the 20 to be unveiled by 2023. GM pulled away the tarps on three of them, clay models of low-slung Buick and Cadillac SUVs and a futuristic version of the Bolt that looked like half of an airport control tower glued to the top of a car body. The rest remained covered. \nThe company wouldn\u2019t allow photographs of the vehicles, and it wouldn\u2019t say if any of the vehicles it showed were the ones coming in the next 18 months. Reuss said the new vehicles that aren\u2019t built on the Bolt platform will have GM\u2019s next-generation electric architecture, which he said will be more efficient with longer range than the Bolt\u2019s 238 miles. Through August, GM has sold 11,670 Bolts, which is less than 1 percent of GM\u2019s total US sales so far this year. \nReuss promised that the new vehicles will be profitable as people become more accustomed to the advancing technology. \u201cWe can\u2019t just flip a switch and make the world go all-electric,\u201d he said.

Cyber security continues to threaten the global landscape in 2018 and 95 per cent of CIOs surveyed said they expect cyber threats to increase and impact their organisations, said the survey, presented during Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Ontario. \n\u201cIn response to these concerns, the survey found that digital security ranks high on the CIO agenda as 35 per cent of respondents said they have already invested and deployed some aspect of digital security, and 36 per cent are in the process of planning to implement some form of digital security,\u201d said Andy Rowsell-Jones, Vice President and Distinguished Analyst at Gartner. \n\u201cCIOs are also increasingly adopting AI in their organisations. Predominantly, AI is being used initially, either to boost the customer experience or to fight fraud,\u201d he added. The \u201c2018 Gartner CIO Agenda\u201d survey gathered data from 3,160 CIO respondents in 98 countries and all major industries. The results showed that 95 per cent of CIOs expect their jobs to change or be remixed due to digitalisation. \n\u201cThe CIO\u2019s role must grow and develop as digital business spreads, and disruptive technologies, including intelligent machines and advanced analytics, reach the masses,\u201d said Rowsell-Jones. CIOs surveyed rank AI, followed by digital security and the Internet of Things (IoT), as the most problematic technologies to implement. \nThe respondents agreed that the most common pain point is the fact that these technologies, particularly AI, demand new skills, some of which can be hard to find. The survey found that CIOs are spending more time on the business executive elements of their jobs compared with three years ago.

The actor, who has taken a break from the show for quite some time ahead of her baby\u2019s arrival, celebrated the special moment with her family, friends and it seems her serial\u2019s star cast was also present to share her happiness. \nBhavya Gandhi, who features as Dayaben\u2019s onscreen son Tipendra Gada, shared a picture of the actor on his Instagram account and wrote, \u201cGlad to be a part of my \u201creel\u201d mother\u2019s \u201creal\u201d baby shower ceremony.\u201d \nDisha has gained immense popularity among the audiences for her portrayal of Dayaben in the series, which airs on Sony \u2019s Sab TV. Earlier, there were reports that the actor might walk away from the television show ahead of the baby\u2019s arrival but was retained by the makers. Disha shot for the last episode of Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah on September 17. \nTimes of India earlier reported that the production house shot for very limited hours with the actor keeping her health in mind. They mostly shot close up shots and Disha\u2019s mother-in-law would also accompany her on sets to take good care of her. \n\nDisha tied the knot with Mumbai-based Chartered Accountant Mayur Pandya in November 2015. She is expecting her first child. Disha has also appeared in films like Jodha Akbar, C Kkompany and Love Story 2050, apart from TV shows Khichdi and CID.

However, it has no mention of Taj Mahal, one of the seven \u2018wonders of the world\u2019. \nThe move has not gone unnoticed as it comes a few months after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that Taj Mahal \u201cdid not reflect Indian culture\u201d. Released by state Tourism Minister Rita Bahuguna, the cover has a picture of the Ganga Aarti in Varanasi with a picture of Adityanath and Bahuguna lighting a traditional lamp on the inside. \nThe booklet features most of the cultural and religious sites of tourism and carries names of temples from Mathura, Ayodhya and Gorakhpur. Giving special attention to sites pertaining to the Hindu religion, it promotes Ayodhya as the birthplace of Hindu god Ram and Mathura-Vrindavan for their links to another Hindu deity Krishna. It emphasises on the religious and cultural significance of Varanasi and its ghats, the upcoming Ardh Kumbh Mela of Allahabad, and also covers most of the cultural and heritage cites like Awadh and Gorakhpur. \nThe Gorakhpeeth in Gorakhpur, which has the UP CM Adityanath as its head priest, has also been presented as a tourist attraction, along with the Devipatan Shakti Peeth. The booklet also mentions the work done and the development projects for Naimisharanya, Allahabad, Chitrakoot, Kushinagar, Bundelkhand, Mirzapur and Sonbhadra. \nThe absence of a single mention of Taj Mahal in the entire booklet led to reactions from various leaders. CPM member Brinda Karat said, \u201cI believe that for people all over the world, one of the major spots for tourists is the Taj Mahal. It also supports the economy of UP. This is truly made in India. Therefore, people will only laugh at him and his complete ignorance of history and importance of preserving the beauty of Taj Mahal.\u201d \nAfter the omission of Taj Mahal was highlighted, former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav retweeted an older video by the then UP government, titled \u2018Uttar Pradesh \u2013 Home of the Taj\u2019. \nDefending itself over the backlash, the UP government issued a press release on Monday, stating that the state government has allotted Rs 156 crore for schemes catering to Taj Mahal. \n\u201cTourism projects worth Rs 370 crore are proposed, under which schemes worth Rs 156 crore are meant for the Taj Mahal and its surrounding areas in Agra,\u201d the release read. The proposal for the projects have been prepared in consultation with the World Bank and submitted to the Union government for approval, which is expected within the next three months, the release read. \nSpeaking on the exclusion of the Taj Mahal in the booklet, Avanish Awasthi, Director General, Department of Tourism of UP Govt, told The Indian Express that the booklet just included a few of the projects by the state and was in no way a reflection of the complete list of tourism projects. \nIn June, listing achievements of the Narendra Modi -led BJP government, Adityanath had said foreign dignitaries visiting India were now being given copies of Gita and Ramayana instead of Taj Mahal replicas. \u201cForeign dignitaries visiting the country used to be gifted replicas of the Taj Mahal and other minarets which did not reflect Indian culture,\u201d Adityanath reportedly said.

Beware, you may be at an increased risk of atherosclerosis, a condition in which the arteries tend to harden and narrow due to a build-up of plaque, researchers have warned. On the other hand, eating a healthy breakfast has been shown to promote greater heart health, including healthier weight and cholesterol. \nThe study showed that atherosclerosis was observed with more frequency among people who skipped breakfast and was also higher in participants who consumed low-energy breakfasts compared to breakfast consumers. Importantly, people who skipped breakfast had the greatest waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood lipids and fasting glucose levels. \nParticipants who skipped breakfast were more likely to have an overall unhealthy lifestyle, including poor overall diet, frequent alcohol consumption and smoking. They were also more likely to be hypertensive and overweight or obese. Additionally, cardiometabolic risk markers were more prevalent in those who skipped breakfast and low-energy breakfast consumers compared to breakfast consumers. \n\u201cPeople who regularly skip breakfast likely have an overall unhealthy lifestyle,\u201d said author Valentin Fuster, Director of Mount Sinai Heart Institute \u201cThis study provides evidence that this is one bad habit people can proactively change to reduce their risk for heart disease,\u201d Fuster added. \nFor the study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the team in Madrid examined 4,052 male and female volunteers who were free from cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease. \nOf these, 2.9 per cent skipped breakfast, 69.4 per cent were low-energy breakfast consumers and 27.7 per cent were breakfast consumers.

Researchers have found that just one hour of exercise every week can help prevent depression. \nThe results, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, showed that people of all ages can gain mental health benefits from even small amounts of exercise. The analysis involved 33,908 Norwegian adults who had their levels of exercise and symptoms of depression and anxiety monitored over 11 years. \nThe team found that 12 per cent of cases of depression could have been prevented if participants undertook just one hour of physical activity each week. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for some time that exercise has a role to play in treating symptoms of depression, but this is the first time we have been able to quantify the preventative potential of physical activity in terms of reducing future levels of depression,\u201d said lead author Samuel Harvey, Associate Professor at Black Dog Institute and University of New South Wales in Australia. \n\u201cThese findings are exciting because they show that even relatively small amounts of exercise \u2013 from one hour per week \u2013 can deliver significant protection against depression,\u201d Harvey said. The researchers believe that the combined impact of the various physical and social benefits of physical activity could be linked to mental health benefits of exercise. \n\u201cIf we can find ways to increase the population\u2019s level of physical activity even by a small amount, then this is likely to bring substantial physical and mental health benefits,\u201d Harvey added. With sedentary lifestyles becoming the norm worldwide, and rates of depression growing, these results are particularly pertinent as they highlight that even small lifestyle changes can reap significant mental health benefits, Harvey said.

He is survived by his wife Nayan Kala Chemjung and one son.\nNaik Mahendra Chemjung was a brave and sincere soldier, the spokesperson said, adding that the nation will always remain indebted to him for the supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty.

Alert BSF troops in Arnia sector had on Saturday last detected an incomplete cross border tunnel emanating from Pakistan side of the international border.\nEarlier on Wednesday last, Pakistani troops had resorted to mortar shelling on civilian areas in Balakote and Manjakote sectors of Poonch and Rajouri districts, respectively, injuring two civilians including a 50-year-old woman on September 27.\nFor all the latest India\n\u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "modi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "prakash raj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yogi adityanath", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jawan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chemjung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naik mahendra chemjung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krishna ghati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zobia kousar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nayan kala chemjung", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pakistan army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian army", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "poonch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chilingdin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kashmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jammu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nepal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:51:21.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9db1bf0d7814cd4607f493308cdb975ce4f9972c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOkTZx7K9XQAJa87gDbxOB8L9FcuchGf3MOO9brcQg47tyRvnmRR2BK.QUo4iU4QGQYJk5l2cS01jixgtM6UC3.aNceXObR5lpVKwYLuZzmmA--", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/india/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "India \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "Four accused in rape of minor girl arrested in Muzaffarpur", "title_full": "Four accused in rape of minor girl arrested in Muzaffarpur", "published": "2017-10-03T15:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/09/gangrape-759.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 86, "comments": 0, "shares": 86}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9db1bf0d7814cd4607f493308cdb975ce4f9972c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOkTZx7K9XQAJa87gDbxOB8L9FcuchGf3MOO9brcQg47tyRvnmRR2BK.QUo4iU4QGQYJk5l2cS01jixgtM6UC3.aNceXObR5lpVKwYLuZzmmA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Four accused in rape of minor girl arrested in Muzaffarpur", "text": "Bihar CM Nitish Kumar campaigns against child marriage, dowry \nFour youths accused of raping a minor girl in a Muzaffarpur village on Saturday have been arrested by the police.Four youths accused of raping a minor girl in a Muzaffarpur village on Saturday have been arrested by the police.

The Adarsh scam had kicked up a political storm leading to the resignation of the then Congress Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Ashok Chavan. The 31-storey Adarsh apartments was built at Colaba in posh South Mumbai locality for 1999 Kargil war heroes and war widows. \nA bench comprising Justices J Chelameswar and S Abdul Nazeer asked the probe agency to file its response within two weeks after the counsel appearing for the housing society said they needed money for maintenance of the building. \nSenior counsel Meenakshi Arora, appearing for the housing society, told the apex court that money in the frozen bank accounts belonged to the cooperative society which has nothing to do with the alleged scam. \nShe said the Bombay High Court had dismissed their plea seeking defreezing of the bank accounts and said that it would remain frozen till the conclusion of the criminal case trial. \u201cThese bank accounts should be defreezed. The cooperative society is not an accused in the case. These accounts were frozen when the probe had started in the case,\u201d Arora said, adding that the cooperative society and its bank accounts have \u201cno direct link\u201d with the alleged crime. \nThe Bombay High Court had earlier ordered demolition of the apartments and sought initiation of criminal proceedings against politicians and bureaucrats for alleged misuse of powers, holding that the tower was illegally constructed. \nIt had asked the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest to carry out the demolition at the expense of Adarsh Society. \nIt had also asked the Centre and Maharashtra government to consider initiating civil and criminal proceedings against bureaucrats, ministers and politicians for misuse and abuse of power to get plots under the scheme, originally meant for Kargil war heroes and war widows. \nLater, the top court in July last year had said that the Adarsh apartments would not be demolished for the time being and asked the Centre to secure it after taking its possession from the housing society. \nIn 2011, the Maharashtra government had set up a two-member judicial commission headed by Justice J A Patil to inquire into the Adarsh scam. \nAfter probing the issue for over two years, it submitted its report in 2013, which found that there had been 25 illegal allotments, including 22 purchases made by proxy. Later, the CBI, the Income Tax Department and Enforcement Directorate (ED) also investigated the scam.

The bench sought a status report from the police by November 27 on the man\u2019s allegations against his younger son. The petitioner, Ghanshyam Singh Rawat, has alleged that his younger son, along with some associates, had severely assaulted him and tried to kill him when he refused to sell his house and give the proceeds to his son. \nRawat claimed that despite lodging a complaint, the police had failed to act against his son.

He said the Act does not contain any provision to meet the needs of persons like him, who do not seek any maintenance from their children but only wish to be allowed to live in peace. \nHe has also contended that such people need to be protected from hostile and violent children who are only interested in grabbing the properties of their parents and do not care how much suffering they cause.

The \u2018Modi magic\u2019 deserves that a temple be built which will also be a kind of commemoration of Modiji\u2019s model of development,\u201d said J P Singh, a \u201cfollower and supporter\u201d of Narendra Modi told the media who owns a trust. Singh recently retired on September 29 as assistant engineer in the Uttar Pradesh irrigation and water department. The temple would be built in the Sardhana area of Meerut where a 100-foot statue of the Prime Minister would be installed. \n\u201c5 acres of land has been bought on Meerut-Karnal highway. A statue of Modiji will be installed in the temple. It will take two years to complete the Modi temple,\u201d he said, adding that the Bhumi Pujan and the stone laying ceremony for the edifice would take place on October 23. The estimated expenditure of \u20b910 crore would be generated out of public donations, he added. According to various reports, Singh has clarified that prayers would not be offered to Modi himself and the actual God to be worshipped in the temple is yet to be decided. \nMeanwhile, Modi already has a temple dedicated to him in Rajkot, since 2015, where his status is installed as the de facto deity, to which prayers are offered regularly. It is run by a trust formed by some of his supporters. \nIndia has long been a place of offbeat deities; from a cinema superstar to a sportsperson, mass veneration has oft equaled temples and shrines. Here are two other literally-worshipped politicians: \n\u201cGoddess Sonia\u201d: Another famous politician shrine in Mallial, Telangana belongs to the AICC President Sonia Gandhi . The temple, complete with a bronze statue of Goddess Sonia and portraits of her family members ( Rajiv Gandhi , Rahul Gandhi and Indira Gandhi ), was set up by Congress party leaders in Telangana as a gesture of \u2018gratitude\u2019 towards Sonia Gandhi for separating Telangana from Andhra Pradesh. \nMGR Shrine: Unsurprisingly the late superstar-turned Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu has a famed shrine in his name that continues to inspire his followers. M G Ramachandran, who held a deity-like aura and sway among his fans since his days as a famous actor in Kollywood, has a temple dedicated to him in Nathamedu village in Thiruninravur district of Tamil Nadu since 2011.   \u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "modi", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajiv gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telangana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahul gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhumi pujan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonia gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "g ramachandran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j p singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modiji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indira gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modiji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aicc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ie online media services pvt ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "meerut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bilaspur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathamedu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thiruninravur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sardhana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "telangana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andhra pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tamil nadu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mallial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meerut-karnal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uttar pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:51:31.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be82879bc77dd1cb6090d6a55e05eedb588adac4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qM19y.e5Zc1FaG8xLy.1PQNp447cbY1k9r2fHqF4XgO_iahrfUI9_SSw7xsJ.3wSyYkHN9lmhA9RW9LILJxq1fADSBU2MiGtB0Y4jHp_ODbgxVxIgrIBHuP", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/india/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "India \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar confirms BHU V-C GC Tripathi on leave", "title_full": "HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar confirms BHU V-C GC Tripathi on leave", "published": "2017-10-03T15:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/bhu.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 93, "comments": 0, "shares": 93}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be82879bc77dd1cb6090d6a55e05eedb588adac4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qM19y.e5Zc1FaG8xLy.1PQNp447cbY1k9r2fHqF4XgO_iahrfUI9_SSw7xsJ.3wSyYkHN9lmhA9RW9LILJxq1fADSBU2MiGtB0Y4jHp_ODbgxVxIgrIBHuP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ritika Chopra", "published": "2017-10-03T15:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar confirms BHU V-C GC Tripathi on leave", "text": "Prakash Javadekar did not wish to comment on who would act as V-C in GC Tripathi\u2019s absence.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar asked them to make submissions in this regard, stating the extent of debris removed by each of these authorities. \u201cYou have filed affidavits before us in Manoj Misra (Yamuna) case stating that debris from the floodplains of Yamuna have been removed. However, they (AoL) are saying something different. You address us on that behalf,\u201d the bench said. \nThe observation came after the lawyer for the Art of Living (AoL) foundation of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar told the green panel that the debris already existed on the site before the event and the condition of floodplains was \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201chighly polluted\u201d. The AoL had contended that the event site was not an identified floodplain even after NGT\u2019s 2015 direction to the authorities to demarcate the floodplain, and hence it cannot even be considered a floodplain. \nThe AoL\u2019s contention came in the backdrop of an expert committee earlier telling the NGT that a whopping Rs 42.02 crore would be required to restore Yamuna floodplains which was ravaged due to the AoL cultural extravaganza. \u201cIn any event, there is no prohibition whatsoever on conducting cultural activities on floodplains. Even according to the reports of the principal committee submitted to this tribunal, which form an integral part of the judgement dated January 13, 2015, conducting of cultural activities on floodplains is not prohibited\u2026 \n\u201cHaving obtained all required approvals from all relevant statutory authorities, Respondent No 3 (AoL) has not violated any law or regulation by holding the festival at the event site or carried out any activity which has led to any pollution,\u201d it claimed. AoL told the bench that the contention of the committee that compaction has been caused by the World Culture Festival organised by it was \u201cerroneous and untenable\u201d as the panel has not conducted any scientific test or geotechnical investigation of the soil density of the land. \n\u201cIn the absence of scientific data and investigation, the Committee has concluded, without any basis, that there has been compaction. It is scientifically impossible to assess compaction without conducting a soil density test. Merely on a visual assessment (as done by the Committee), it is not possible to assess whether or not there has been compaction,\u201d it claimed. The allegation that there has been compaction in the area where the stage for the event was located is without any basis as the stage was a floating stage and was supported on a series of iron scaffolding with raft footing. \n\u201cNothing was anchored or embedded in the ground and as such the stage had a floating foundation. The impact of such a foundation on the ground is therefore insignificant,\u201d AoL said. Referring to a 1985 Survey of India map, the AoL said the site did not have any wetland as there are no contours and the entire event site is flat. \n\u201cEven the Ramsar Convention which is a fundamental document covering wetlands across the globe does not identify or mention that the event site contains any wetland. There are various satellite images which indicate that the event site does not contain any wetland as alleged or otherwise. \u201cIt is evident from these images that the event site is land on which agricultural activity is being carried on. These satellite images at various intervals from December 22, 2000 to December 6, 2015 establish conclusively that the entire event site was under agricultural use,\u201d it said. \nThe hearing remained inconclusive and will continue tomorrow. The foundation had earlier told the NGT that the Yamuna floodplain was in a \u201csordid\u201d condition prior to the holding of the three-day World Culture Festival. The NGT set up the Principal Committee to see execution of Yamuna rejuvenation.

Chief Magistrate Emma Louise Arbuthnot has been hearing Mallya\u2019s extradition case at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on his previous arrest warrant executed by Scotland Yard in April. \nMallya\u2019s trial, in that case, is scheduled for two weeks, starting December 4. It remains to be seen if both cases will be clubbed together, which may lead to a delay in the trial date. \nMallya, who owes over Rs 9,000 crore to various Indian banks, has been living in self-imposed exile in Britain since March 2016. \nHe was earlier arrested by Scotland Yard in April on fraud allegations, triggering an official extradition process in the British courts. He attended a central London police station for his arrest and was released on conditional bail a few hours later after providing a bail bond worth 650,000 pounds, assuring the court of abiding by all conditions associated with extradition proceedings, such as the surrender of his passport and a ban on him possessing any travel documents.   \u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vijay mallya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma louise arbuthnot", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "westminster magistrates\u2019 court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metropolitan police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ie online media services pvt ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland yard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:51:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ed5041d0d3b85c5c526ce66bfec23a73da5ad82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qNvfSCsSHtjUfRP4Mje7csSDXHbwcwpTCHvAJPfu1CxP5e2GOTXHhVPmvUxqH8mwF0ZEi5evJps01dSKQXDWyueDmB9gR1AvC7AyXBUnSZPiw--", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/india/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "India \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "GJM leader Binay Tamang asks BJP to clear stand on Gorkhaland", "title_full": "GJM leader Binay Tamang asks BJP to clear stand on Gorkhaland", "published": "2017-10-03T14:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/tamang.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 12, "comments": 0, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ed5041d0d3b85c5c526ce66bfec23a73da5ad82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qNvfSCsSHtjUfRP4Mje7csSDXHbwcwpTCHvAJPfu1CxP5e2GOTXHhVPmvUxqH8mwF0ZEi5evJps01dSKQXDWyueDmB9gR1AvC7AyXBUnSZPiw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "GJM leader Binay Tamang asks BJP to clear stand on Gorkhaland", "text": "MCG elections: BJP gets the numbers \nChairman of the Board of Administrators for Darjeeling hills and expelled GJM leader Binay Tamang has asked Union minister S S Ahluwalia and West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh to clear their stand on the Gorkhaland issue before setting foot in the hills.

Some operators had complained about methods and results of the TRAI\u2019s MySpeed app, and the regulator will soon come out with a white paper on underlying methodology and algorithms used by the said app for calculating data speeds of various service providers. \n\u201cWe have also contacted Ookla and others. We are trying to understand what their methods are \u2026 We would like all stakeholders to sit together and come to a conclusion over most appropriate methodology,\u201d the TRAI chairman said. The regulator will also take suggestions from operators on the issue, he said. \u201cWe will sit together with the operators and take their suggestions as what should be an agreed methodology so there are no such complaints,\u201d Sharma said on the sidelines of the TRAI\u2019s open house discussion on \u2018data speed under wireless broadband plans\u2019. \nAfter strengthening the service quality norms for voice calls, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is now focusing its attention on benchmarks for data experience of consumers. TRAI hopes to finalise, by month-end, views on parameters for measuring data speeds for wireless broadband. \u201cThere were large number of quality of service (norms) for voice (offerings) like call drops. Data has recently started becoming prominent, and voice is now an application on top of data. So there is a need to have much better grip on the QoS in the data world,\u201d he added. \nSharma said that both TRAI\u2019s views on the data speed issue and its white paper on MySpeed app will be out by the month-end. \u201cWork on both the aspects will happen simultaneously,\u201d he said. While operators had previously stated that having a minimum guaranteed data speed would be difficult in the wireless world, TRAI is looking at suitable parameters, say average speed, that could serve as a benchmark. \nIn its consultation paper on wireless broadband data speeds, TRAI has also sought industry\u2019s views on whether information on wireless broadband speeds currently being disclosed is enough for consumers to make informed choices. It has asked if average speed can be specified by service providers. The consultation also touches on other related issues such as the need to revisit service quality parameters or existing benchmarks stipulated in the regulations.

A 3.5mm headset jack is present at the top. \nI struggled a bit using the power button and volume up key as they\u2019re placed a little higher on the right edge. Given this has a large 5.5-inch screen, place the power button more towards the center would really make it easy to use. There\u2019s a round fingerprint sensor at the back. This isn\u2019t the fastest I\u2019ve seen on a phone, but works fairly well and accurately. 10.or E has a polycarbonate body design, no visible antenna lines, and rounded edges. The back cover has a smooth finish, one that isn\u2019t slippery to hold. \n10.or E has a 5.5-inch Full HD display with a 2.5D curved Corning Gorilla Glass 3 coating on top. The phone display is a delight to look at and viewing angles are good as well. The colours are well balanced and icons appear sharp, which is great. I didn\u2019t like the presence of thick bezels on top and bottom, especially when it has on-screen navigation buttons. \n10.or E Camera \n10.or E has a 13MP rear camera with CMOS sensor, PDAF, and flash. Frankly, I wasn\u2019t impressed with the quality of pictures taken using back camera. I had to struggle with the focus (a lot), especially in dimly lit places. The results missed details and I didn\u2019t like the colour reproduction. I\u2019ve seen better cameras in a Rs 7,999 phone. 10.or E camera sample. (Image resized for web) 10.or E camera sample. (Image resized for web) 10.or E camera sample. (Image resized for web) \nA note to readers \u2013 Forget this one if you want a phone for its camera. The front 5MP camera performs like it should. Don\u2019t expect great or detailed pictures, but it works well if you\u2019re happy with basic selfies. \n10.or E Battery, Processor, and Memory \n10.or E is powered by an Octa-core Snapdragon 430 processor and we got the 3GB RAM variant for review. In terms of performance, the phone is capable of handling most day to day tasks such as browsing Internet, messaging, and making calls. \nHowever, I encountered visible lags while multitasking as well as switching between tabs. Also, there was a delay in touch response time. Playing graphics heavy games like Asphalt-8 makes the phone warm within a four minutes, and slows it down as well. On our PC Mark battery test, it scored 12 hours and 33 minutes, which is a good score. \n10.or E has a 4,000mAh battery which easily lasts for two days on moderate usage which includes browsing Internet and social media, watching a couple of videos, making 4G calls, and messaging. On our PC Mark battery test, it scored 12 hours and 33 minutes, which is a good score. 10.or E takes more than two and half hours to get fully charged from 15 per cent battery left. \n10.or E Software \n10.or E runs Android 7.1.2 Nougat and offers stock UI experience, which I\u2019ve always enjoyed. Stock UI means minimum bloatware, which boosts up phone\u2019s battery and processing power. Plus a lot of OEMs are steering towards stock UI version for their devices and we could see it being adopted by a lot more brands. The phone comes preloaded with Amazon app, and a 10.or Care app. \n10.ore E Final Thoughts \n1.or E is a good first attempt by the company. The budget smartphone segment is crowded with players like Xiaomi , Motorola , and Coolpad which are offering good value-for-money devices. Sure, 10.or E has a good battery and a Full HD display to boast about, but the camera bit and performance issues need to be taken be sorted. For now, this is just another budget phone on the list.   \u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Top News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "modi", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "prakash raj", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "yogi adityanath", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ie online media services pvt ltd more top news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motorola", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:04:52.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06618f699c3972dd42102eafdf60512d50330cc3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOyZLBZzZCtjCzivnbDSqHReefTqKex.zVVhV4Wy0EcsSC4SM7EnhgtqpcvumXDL65MbVFy94BwmmJ9J.2s2C5IEDt82Hx8JhzNZXk3xaVo20NzZtYXt0.QyeKTvJ9PhrXtWsoa4j.TwA--", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/technology/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Technology \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "Irish court refers landmark EU-US data transfer case to EU", "title_full": "Irish court refers landmark EU-US data transfer case to EU", "published": "2017-10-03T15:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/ireland-facebook-copy.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06618f699c3972dd42102eafdf60512d50330cc3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOyZLBZzZCtjCzivnbDSqHReefTqKex.zVVhV4Wy0EcsSC4SM7EnhgtqpcvumXDL65MbVFy94BwmmJ9J.2s2C5IEDt82Hx8JhzNZXk3xaVo20NzZtYXt0.QyeKTvJ9PhrXtWsoa4j.TwA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Irish court refers landmark EU-US data transfer case to EU", "text": "Las Vegas shooting: Google, Facebook, Twitter failed to curb fake news \nIreland\u2019s High Court today ruled that the Court of Justice of the European Union must decide the rules on the transfer of data from European Facebook users to the US \u201cto ensure consistency\u201d. Judge Caroline Costello said that \u201conly a decision of CJEU can resolve the potential for inconsistent applications\u201d of the mechanism used by internet giants to transfer European users\u2019 data to the US. \nThe legal action follows a complaint by Austrian privacy lawyer Max Schrems to Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) about Facebook\u2019s use of so-called standard contractual clauses (SCCs) to transfer personal data from Europe to the US, via its European headquarters in Dublin. SCCs are now widely used by data exporters and are intended to allow for the legal transfer of data from EU citizens as long as \u201cadequate protection\u201d is in place. \nSchrems argues that the SCCs offer no redress for European citizens in the US in the event of their data being accessed by a third party, such as US intelligence services, or compromised in some other way. His legal team claimed that the Irish watchdog already had the power to stop data transfers from Facebook and should use it. Mason Hayes & Curran, the Dublin-based legal team acting for Facebook, earlier warned in a briefing note of the negative impact a defeat would have on its client and other multinationals. \n\u201cThe widespread interest in this case arises, in part, from the potential economic and commercial consequences that could flow from a ruling that the SCC decisions are invalid,\u201d it said. The lawyers quoted estimates saying that if services and cross-border data flows were to be disrupted, the European Union\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) could be hit by as much as 1.3 percentage points. \nFacebook argues there is nothing wrong with the current system and that there is no need for a referral. It was forced to switch to SCCs last year after the European Court of Justice ruled in 2015 that the Safe Harbour framework, which had governed the EU-US flow of personal data, contravened EU law because the privacy of European citizens could not be guaranteed in the US. \nThe SCCs are considered as something of a stopgap measure designed to allow the transfer of data, pending agreement on a more comprehensive regime.

It also points out that more people are willing to opt for iPhone X compared to iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus . Wireless charging in iPhone X seems to be the most popular feature followed by facial recognition. While facial recognition is exclusive to Apple\u2019s tenth anniversary edition iPhone, wireless charging is available for iPhone 8 series as well. \nAccording to a note by RBC analyst Amit Daryanani, about 57 per cent people have indicated preference for 256GB storage option of iPhone X. In case of iPhone 8, close to 45 per cent users opted for the 256GB model. Notably, iPhone X is the most expensive iPhone that the company has ever made and it starts upwards of $1000 for the base model with 64GB storage. The 256GB variant costs $150. \n\u201cDespite Apple increasing the minimum storage in iPhones, there has been a shift in consumer preference towards higher storage models. In case of iPhone X, for the first time, a majority of users have indicated preference for the highest storage models with over 57% opting for the 256GB model. This skew is stronger than iPhone 8 where 45% opted for 256GB model,\u201d read RBC analyst Amit Daryanani\u2019s note, according to a report on Business Insider. \nRBC\u2019s study shows that only 17 per cent and 20 per cent are planning to buy iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus respectively and the number was much higher (28 per cent) for iPhone X. RBC\u2019s survey saw the participation of more than 4,000 people in the US. \nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had previously predicted that pre-orders for iPhone X could reach over 50 million, and Apple could struggle to keep up with the high demand for the smartphone. Further, iPhone X will likely to be in \u2018tight supply\u2019 until the first half of 2018, and the anticipation could likely contribute to its demand. \nApple iPhone X is a significant upgrade to previous-generations iPhones from the company. It features an all new edge-to-edge OLED display, A11 Bionic chip which brings processing power for AR and VR capabilities as well as facial recognition for unlocking the device. \nApple iPhone 8 series bring minor changes to iPhone 7, 7 Plus. There\u2019s a new glass back design, a True Tone display, upgraded cameras, A11 Bionic chipset, wireless charging and other changes. The dual cameras on the iPhone 8 Plus now support the new \u201cPortrait Lighting\u201d feature.   \u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:04:56.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f74604f5f51913c638c61ea53cbf4e4d5c603c36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOyZLBZzZCtjCUzEWgDJ5s.vjsTec7V7DEAlHDc2_iQa9KjwlYnjL5O0c_2EGSeldG6CRXiqGt70uU4oJ3HcAYUj6skWPIPkvOMdYFmEw4hCqyOPbOeft94Yet7P32uNJyGWJohEgpyd2tguKRwRqCa", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/technology/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Technology \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "Google Android 8.0 Oreo now on 0.2 per cent devices, Nougat on 17%", "title_full": "Google Android 8.0 Oreo now on 0.2 per cent devices, Nougat on 17%", "published": "2017-10-03T14:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/androidoreo_big_google.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f74604f5f51913c638c61ea53cbf4e4d5c603c36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOyZLBZzZCtjCUzEWgDJ5s.vjsTec7V7DEAlHDc2_iQa9KjwlYnjL5O0c_2EGSeldG6CRXiqGt70uU4oJ3HcAYUj6skWPIPkvOMdYFmEw4hCqyOPbOeft94Yet7P32uNJyGWJohEgpyd2tguKRwRqCa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Android 8.0 Oreo now on 0.2 per cent devices, Nougat on 17%", "text": "Google Android 8.0 Oreo now on 0.2 per cent devices, Nougat on 17% Google Android 8.0 Oreo now on 0.2 per cent devices, Nougat on 17% Google's latest Android OS 8.0 Oreo is now listed on the monthly data mapping the distribution of various versions of the mobile OS. By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Published:October 3, 2017 4:51 pm Google Android Oreo now on 0.2 per cent devices and the adoption rate continues to rise very slowly. \nGoogle \u2019s latest Android OS 8.0 Oreo is now listed on the monthly data mapping the distribution of various versions of the mobile OS. Of course, Android Oreo 8.0 adoption remains low and it is still running on only 0.2 per cent of devices in the market. The previous OS, which is Android Nougat is on around 17.8 percentage point of active devices. While Android Nougat 7.0.0 is on 15.8 per cent devices, around 2 per cent users are on Android Nougat 7.1. \nAndroid\u2019s OS fragmentation problem is one that is not going to be solved anytime soon. While Android Oreo is now available for Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus devices, most other manufacturers and OEMs are still working on the update. With carrier network testing, chip testing, OEM testing, etc, the Android Oreo update for most phones will probably appear by the time the Android P is out. Recently Sony launched its Xperia XZ1 in the market with Android Oreo running out of the box. \nFor now even Android Nougat\u2019s base is not the majority one on the chart. Android Marshmallow continues to dominate with 32 per cent of Android devices still on this version of the OS. The nearly two-and-half-year old OS still continues to dominate Android\u2019s charts, and many phones remain on Marshmallow, especially budget ones. These are unlikely to get the update to Nougat. \nAndroid Lollipop has a 27.7 percentage point share, this includes 6.7 per cent devices on Android 5.0, while 21 per cent devices are on Android 5.1 Lollipop.

Inflammation linked to belly fat in elderly: Study Contrary to the conventional view that stress enhances our ability to detect sources of threat, a team of researchers have found that it diminishes the ability to predict new dangers. The research indicated that stress reduces physiological response to the new threat cue.\n\u201cOur study shows that when we are under stress, we pay less attention to changes in the environment, potentially putting us at an increased risk for ignoring new sources of threat,\u201d said lead author Candace Raio, a postdoctoral researcher at New York University.\nThe researchers conducted a series of experiments to test the ability to learn to flexibly update threat responses under stressful conditions. Here, the participants viewed images on a computer screen. The appearance of some images was coupled with a mild, electric wrist-shock.\nHalf of the participants underwent a laboratory procedure a day later designed to induce stress. This \u201cstress group\u201d placed their arm in an ice-water bath for a few minutes, which elevated the two stress hormones alpha-amylase and cortisol.\nLater, all the participants repeated the threat-conditioning procedure. However, this time the cue outcomes switched. The earlier threatening cue no longer predicts shock, but the formerly safe cue did. While the participants viewed the images, the researchers collected physiological arousal responses in order to measure how individuals anticipated the outcome of each cue.\nOn the second day, the \u201cstress group\u201d was less likely to change their responses to threats than the control group. The research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested that participants did not fully switch their association with this cue from safe to threatening.\nFor ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "candace raio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national academy of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:19:06.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b21722ef16699b27b4c8d9357e514023c9f3380", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOhN_OCfbboqDRjY9agt0V2Xcia4tQFf05CFeMVh0ZmmUP2cnF.ozvlpKHDETiS9E6HFGEQYEEtW6Tnb6P1RnzE84RCdoxFs46r8jVAl0HxKA--", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/lifestyle/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Lifestyle \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "Katrina Kaif\u2019s latest Instagram photo has her flaunting summer love in this floral Peter Pilotto dress", "title_full": "Katrina Kaif\u2019s latest Instagram photo has her flaunting summer love in this floral Peter Pilotto dress", "published": "2017-10-03T15:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/katrina-kaif-dress_759.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 337, "comments": 0, "shares": 337}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b21722ef16699b27b4c8d9357e514023c9f3380", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOhN_OCfbboqDRjY9agt0V2Xcia4tQFf05CFeMVh0ZmmUP2cnF.ozvlpKHDETiS9E6HFGEQYEEtW6Tnb6P1RnzE84RCdoxFs46r8jVAl0HxKA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Katrina Kaif\u2019s latest Instagram photo has her flaunting summer love in this floral Peter Pilotto dress", "text": "Take some inspiration from Katrina Kaif if you\u2019re heading out to a summer destination for your vacations.

We think Patani missed the mark by inches this time but still managed to look elegant and graceful. \nThe MS Dhoni star rounded out her look with black heels by Only Two Feet and went with minimal make-up and nude lips, which we feel added a sultry touch to her attire and made up for the bling that more accessories could have added.

(Source: AP) However, Deldicque has said there were differences, including the way the subject holds her chest and the hairstyle. Art historians believe Leonardo drew or painted a nude version of the Mona Lisa. Deldicque acknowledged that the belief is feeding hopes that the Chantilly museum\u2019s sketch was indeed made by Leonardo\u2019s hand.\nAmong the array of clues under study is whether the artist of the sketch was left-handed. \u201cWe know that Leonardo da Vinci was left-handed and now we are just looking for the left-handed features,\u201d the curator said. But the task is difficult. \u201cThe drawing is very old, very fragile,\u201d he said, making it uncertain firm evidence will be uncovered showing that the charcoal nude was sketched with a left hand.\nThe government-run Center for Research and Restoration of the Museums of France says the sketch will stay out of the public eye until the examination by experts is complete.\nWatch the video here.\nFor ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fren", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vikrant", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mona lisa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "leonardo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mathieu deldicque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonardo da vinci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deldicque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruno mottin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "center for research and restoration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "louvre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chantilly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "musee conde du domaine de chantilly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venice", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:19:16.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "653ac4844409b2cfdf2be4e0afd43a1ddabe2071", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOhN_OCfbboqKxpBxaQQe367TS_SZD1pvH6.PgG4kO.d0fKLBKy95gcnmcQtRO.vpx7ox8H.p0FkOdJ29_.OnK0aB73a9KwxdOfFjouj_J8IlKX2OcsGZ3qvD9TSQQwzOJhl2YlQCTv0lojXpIqcNHA_jHx34JAVyk-", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/lifestyle/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Lifestyle \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "A father\u2019s heartfelt appeal: Help me save my 2.5 year old from blood cancer", "title_full": "A father\u2019s heartfelt appeal: Help me save my 2.5 year old from blood cancer", "published": "2017-10-03T11:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/lead-n-1.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "653ac4844409b2cfdf2be4e0afd43a1ddabe2071", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qOhN_OCfbboqKxpBxaQQe367TS_SZD1pvH6.PgG4kO.d0fKLBKy95gcnmcQtRO.vpx7ox8H.p0FkOdJ29_.OnK0aB73a9KwxdOfFjouj_J8IlKX2OcsGZ3qvD9TSQQwzOJhl2YlQCTv0lojXpIqcNHA_jHx34JAVyk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T11:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "A father\u2019s heartfelt appeal: Help me save my 2.5 year old from blood cancer", "text": "A father\u2019s heartfelt appeal: Help me save my 2.5 year old from blood cancer A father\u2019s heartfelt appeal: Help me save my 2.5 year old from blood cancer It has been 7 months since my 2.5-year-old son, Shaurya, was diagnosed with Leukemia. I\u2019m sure cancer has never met a soul like him. He\u2019s over 200 days and 4 chemotherapy sessions into the disease, but his spirit and smile remain unfazed. Updated: October 3, 2017 5:54 pm Always creating a ruckus in the hospital, Shaurya is the apple of everyone\u2019s eye. \nThe last time I cried was when my son said to me, \u201cIs this my new hairstyle baba? But there\u2019s no hair at all!\u201d He was chuckling, running his hand over his hairless head. \nIt has been 7 months since my 2.5-year-old son, Shaurya, was diagnosed with Leukemia. I\u2019m sure cancer has never met a soul like him. He\u2019s over 200 days and 4 chemotherapy sessions into the disease, but his spirit and smile remain unfazed. I feel like a failure who can\u2019t even pay a sum of 15 lakh to save his son from dying. This is perhaps why I wish to share my story with you. \nMy name is Deepak Chaurasia. I live in Charni Road with my parents, wife, and Shaurya. I\u2019m a team leader at Syska Accessories and earn a sum of 18,000 per month. My salary is the only source of income for our family of five. When I received the news about Shaurya\u2019s illness, I knocked on every possible loved one\u2019s door for help. With their contribution, I managed to gather Rs. 8.5 lakh, but it was all in vain. All that money was exhausted in paying the piled up bills and purchasing the pending prescribed medicines. It drained me off my savings bringing me back to zero. Now I have no source of help left to gather Rs. 15 lakh all over again. I feel utterly broken and helpless. Donations are the only option left for me. \n\nSometimes, a seemingly ordinary day can change your whole life. My life changed in February 2017 when one day my son developed rashes on his face. This was followed by swollen shoulders and high fever. Worried, we rushed him to the hospital, where a devastating diagnosis shattered our world \u2013 Shaurya had blood cancer. It took a lot of time for me to just accept that my son had cancer. I couldn\u2019t muster the courage to inform my wife. I kept this news from her for over 10 days. What if she couldn\u2019t handle it? What if she cried in front of our son? How will a 2.5-year-old battle cancer if two full grown adults cry in front of him? We have to be his strength, after all. \nAlways creating a ruckus in the hospital, my Shaurya is the apple of everyone\u2019s eye. Nobody believes us when we tell them our son has blood cancer. He is always so playful and cheerful. There are times when his mother and I look away when the doctors come to draw blood, but he is always ready and willing. I still remember how nervous we were the first time he was getting an injection. We held him close and placed his favorite Perk chocolate in his hand. Since that day, every time the doctor arrives, he looks at me and asks for another. That\u2019s all he needs to face the needle. So we have kept a jar full of chocolates by his bedside. I feel my son is way stronger than his parents, and that makes me proud. \nShaurya has a machine attached to his body. He has undergone 4 out of 5 cycles of chemotherapy that are required currently. Doctors say that he would need to continue the treatment for at least 2.5 years. There are times when he\u2019s required to spend more than a month at the hospital because the cycle lasts for over 45 days. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see his childhood getting lost in hospitals. I know my son deserves a better life and your donations can help me give him that. \nThe doctors are very surprised with his response to the treatment. They had warned me of sad times but ever since his diagnosis, I\u2019ve only seen smiles in place of sadness and hope in place of despair. That makes me very nervous. I keep fearing that one day I\u2019ll wake up to a weak and sad Shaurya. I hope to get his treatment started as soon as I can. If my son loses his precious smile, it will devastate me. \nPlease help me maintain that smile on Shaurya\u2019s face by donating to our fundraiser on Ketto .

But this time the actor did give us quite a shock when she stepped out in a hot pink pantsuit by Riva. How an outfit so garish can come across as so bland is anyone\u2019s guess but that\u2019s how the pantsuit in its almost eye-blinding grandeur looked. The outfit could have definitely used some better styling, maybe a belt cinched at the waist to accentuate it and break the monotony of garish pink. \nIf you thought pink, the actor\u2019s \u201d favourite crayon\u201d was the culprit of the look, you need to check out her tasseled earrings whose pop of colour is too much for comfort. The earrings by Accessorize, hanging in peacock green and pink tassels did not match with the outfit \u2013 even if they were meant to contrast \u2013 and added another garish hue to the ensemble. The actor sadly failed with the make-up too, choosing to go with a peacock green on the eyelids. We are quite thankful for the nude lips, the only wise choice for this look. \nAnother hot pink number was donned by fashionista Esha Gupta whose sense of style we can\u2019t help applauding. The actor wore a body-hugging dress for an event in Dubai that she attended. We love how stylist Aastha Sharma paired the flashy colour with heels in nude. The contrast toned down the flashy colour, making the combination look stunning. We give full-marks to the actor for carrying off the colour with elegance. \nThough both the actors were bold enough to try on the garish colour, we think Esha Gupta had no competition as she completely nailed the look. \nWho do you think looked better?

He also said that a lot of the Australian players are \u2018scared\u2019 while playing. \n\u201cA lot of them are playing a little bit scared, which we try not to do. We try and make sure they play with a lot of freedom and express themselves as much as they can. But when you\u2019re losing, you play scared, you go insular and you start looking after number one,\u201d Saker said. \u201cI think there\u2019s little bits of that. It\u2019s not dramatic and we know we can fix that. I think the talent is there.\u201d \nThe stand-in head coach added that it is not an issue with any one player in particular and more about the mindset of the team when they are out in the field. \u201cIt\u2019s not mainly personnel, I think it\u2019s mainly just their mindset and where they are in their games,\u201d Saker said. \nAustralia have only won one game in the last 13 completed ODI games away from home. Saker was worried about the team\u2019s away form especially because that the 2019 World Cup will be held in England. He hinted that the team can be re-jigged. \n\u201cObviously, our away form has been quite dreadful so we have to have a look at that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next World Cup is away (from home). I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all doom and gloom, I think there\u2019s some talent in that team. But there\u2019s no doubt we have to probably re-jig a few things and see where we\u2019re at.\u201d \nAustralia now play the three-match T20I series and will look to turn around the things. Saker hoped that his batsmen will now express them freely in the shortest format of the game. \n\u201cBringing almost half the squad in who haven\u2019t been here for the four weeks so far is going to be exciting, and exciting for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Twenty20 cricket we\u2019re definitely going to go out there (to) express ourselves and have some fun. After a long tour, India can sometimes get you down and wear you down but getting five or six new guys into the squad after what\u2019s happened in the one-day series, we\u2019ll be really determined to bounce back.\u201d For all the latest Sports News , download Indian Express App \u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david saker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kedar jadhav", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "saker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ie online media services pvt ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ranchi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:19:30.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6794442ba87719ccd3d868988fe5fae7c93d35ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qPqzce7d0tPrYCKM7sv86G78OW96z5d.7qqodZKWcy.pI9L1cIJY99lylDqk4H_MF0pvFxGiaPrFHBeqrLBSSrd", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/sports/cricket/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Cricket \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "Retirement at 46?

No way, says Brad Hogg", "text": "Judwaa 2 box office collection day 5: Varun Dhawan film stays strong on crucial Tuesday, earns Rs 85.30 cr \nBrad Hogg will be 47 come February but the Australian Chinaman bowler says the thought of announcing retirement from international cricket has not yet crossed his mind. \nWhile he is \u201cnot done yet\u201d, Hogg remains realistic about his chances of making another comeback for Australia. \nHe is currently commentating in the limited-overs series between India and Australia and if it was not for a surgery on his left knee, he may well have been preparing back home to make another First-Class comeback for Western Australia. \n\u201cI am not worried about my age mate. I am still trying to play First-Class cricket for Western Australia. I don\u2019t think I will ever announce my retirement from international cricket because it is a privilege to play for your country and if I am doing well enough I would never say no,\u201d Hogg tells PTI in a freewheeling chat. \nThe boom in T20 cricket has pushed a host of cricketers to stretch their careers. Hogg is a prime example of that alongside India\u2019s \u201cageless\u201d Ashish Nehra, who, at 38, has earned a recall to the Indian team for the three T20s against Australia beginning October 7. \nHogg was 44 when he last played for Australia in 2014 and still thinks he is good enough to bowl at the highest level. \nHe also remains a regular at the Big Bash League and even played the IPL as recently as last year. \n\u201cIf I get the opportunity to play again (for Australia), I would take it. Because once you are long time retired (it is difficult to comeback). If it stops now, it stops now, I know I won\u2019t get to play again. \u201cI am fortunate that at my age I am still wanted. Whether it happens or not, it is another matter but yeah I am not done yet,\u201d he says. \nHogg says the constant curiosity over his age doesn\u2019t bother him and he is focused on getting back to full fitness, having undergone a knee surgery three months ago. \n\u201cWhile I am doing that (recovering), I am using the time to do commentary. I feel at a very fortunate place to be honest and thoroughly enjoying it. The recovery is taking longer than expected but I should be back on the ground soon. Is it tough to maintain fitness as one grows older? \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Hogg. \n\u201cIf you look after yourself, it is not an issue. But as sportsmen, a lot of us have wear and tear. Sometimes it happens early in your career, sometimes it happens late. I am very lucky that it is late in my career. \u201cIn fact I would not call it (injury layoff) a difficult period. I have been extremely lucky to play the game. I am grateful for that. You rather think about the things you have.\u201d \nWhile commentating, he has also found time to help fellow Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, who calls the Australian his mentor with both having spent a lot of time together at the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. \nYadav has been making rapid strides in international cricket ever since making his Test debut against Australia in March, and Hogg is not at all surprised. \n\u201cEveryone\u2019s career graph is different. We all go through different phases and he has got a great foundation. Now he has just to make sure he keeps his head on his shoulders, don\u2019t think too far ahead and keep working on his game. \u201cHe has just got to make sure he is reliable when the captain calls him to bowl. The best cricketers in the world are consistent and reliable, they do the job,\u201d feels Hogg adding Yadav\u2019s accuracy remains one of his biggest strengths. \n\u201cYou rather first work on your strengths than focus on your weaknesses. That is what I all good bowlers do,\u201d he adds.

Nehra\u2019s season was stalled by injuries but he took eight wickets in the six matches that he played. Many a times, his spell proved to be crucial for the Sunrisers Hyderabad. \n\u201cI performed well in the last IPL so I think the selectors must have seen that. I don\u2019t feel I will be out of sorts against Australia,\u201d Nehra said in a conversation with Mid-Day. Nehra also said that he felt \u201cembarassed\u201d when people called him up to congratulate him on his selection. \u201cAfter all, I am 38 years of age,\u201d he said. \nNehra\u2019s career has been hampered by injuries. He shot to fame in the 2003 World Cup, famously taking six wickets in a match against England. Despite the injuries, Nehra has remained a regular in the domestic circuit and has managed 120 ODI appearances. \u201cThey inquired whether I would be able to play the Twenty20 series and I said yes. These days, I cannot play all formats, but I think I will be able to deliver in the forthcoming series,\u201d he said. \nNehra\u2019s chances of making the Indian team, though, has been bleaker due to the emergence of the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar . \u201cI am taking it match-by-match, series by series. I think I will be able to bowl my quota of four overs to the best of my ability,\u201d said Nehra, \u201cI am fortunate to have (Jasprit) Bumrah and Bhuvi (Bhuvneshwar Kumar) in the pace department.\u201d Nehra was especially appreciative of young Jasprit Bumrah. \u201cBumrah is the best in limited-overs business and the way he has bowled, he can be tried in Tests too,\u201d he said.

But this added advantage could well be negated by Australia\u2019s dismal batting record against a strong bowling lineup for England. On the other side is a strong Australian bowling attack against a weak England top order. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no hiding from it and we\u2019re certainly going to try and start making amends,\u201d said Australia\u2019s batting coach Graeme Hick on the topic of recent collapses to cricket.com.au. Hick played 65 Tests for England in a 10-year career. \n\u201cEspecially with the Ashes coming up, we certainly don\u2019t want to be losing wickets in clumps. Our batting collapses are (mental). The players are all there, their techniques are set and they\u2019re all very different and all very individual. Every side collapses at times, but at the moment we seem to be doing it quite a bit in both forms of the game. So I think it is a bit of a mental thing.\u201d \nIn the past 18 months, Australia have gone from a position of strength to absolute mayhem in Colombo last year, in Perth, in Dharamshala against India in the four-match Test series and most recently, in Dhaka to lose the opening Test to Bangladesh. In each of these examples, Australia were in a dominant position and went on to be beaten. \n\u201cAt times when it happens, especially after a long partnership, people sometimes get a little bit relaxed thinking everything is OK and you\u2019re maybe not preparing mentally for that,\u201d Hick says. \u201cAnd the next thing you know you\u2019re strapping your pads on, two or three wickets are down, and you\u2019re out there. Maybe there\u2019s a little bit of that. It happens in all cricket but it\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve identified. You need to identify that (it\u2019s) an important time in the game and maybe just hold yourself back a little bit. Our natural game is quite an aggressive game and at times maybe we need to step back a bit, let a few balls through to the keeper, have a look, take a few deep breaths and suck the atmosphere in rather than chasing things.\u201d \nLike Steve Smith or Darren Lehmann, who have asked for the batsmen to step up following a disappointing 1-4 ODI series loss against India, Hick was at a loss of words in explaining where the team is going wrong. \u201cYou can talk as much as you want about it, but they need to perform on the field,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know that, they\u2019re professionals and they were gutted at the end of (the ODI series).

As America grappled with the deadliest mass shooting in its history, officials reacted cautiously to an Islamic State group claim that Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, had carried out Sunday night\u2019s massacre on behalf of the jihadist group. \nPolice said Paddock, who had no criminal record, smashed windows in his hotel room shortly after 10:00 pm on Sunday and trained bursts of automatic weapons fire on thousands of people attending a country music concert down below. \nIn footage of the massacre broadcast on CNN, the sustained rattle of gunfire is heard as people scream and bolt for cover with little idea of where the shots were coming from. \u201cWe saw bodies down. We didn\u2019t know if they had fallen or had been shot,\u201d said Ralph Rodriguez, an IT consultant from Pomona Valley near Los Angeles, who was at the concert with a group of friends. \n\u201cPeople started grabbing their loved-ones and just strangers, and trying to help them get out of the way,\u201d he said. \nIn a statement on online, IS claimed Paddock was one of its \u201csoldiers\u201d but the FBI said it had found no such connection so far with the local sheriff describing him as a lone \u201cpsychopath.\u201d Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Paddock fired through the door of his hotel room and hit a security guard in the leg. \nBut when a SWAT team stormed the room where Paddock had been staying since September 28, they found he had killed himself. Inside the room were 23 firearms including automatic weapons, he said. \nInvestigators also found another 19 firearms along with explosives and several thousand rounds of ammo at Paddock\u2019s house in Mesquite, Nevada, some 130 km away. \nLombardo said they had discovered several pounds of an explosive called tannerite at the house as well as ammonium nitrate, a type of fertiliser, in his car. \nHe said the death toll had risen to 59, with another 527 people wounded. But the gunman\u2019s motive remains unclear. \u201cWe\u2019re hunting down and tracing every single clue that we can get on his background,\u201d the sheriff said at a late-night briefing. \nSo far, investigators had found no manifesto or anything else to explain Paddock\u2019s actions, he said. \u201cThis individual is a lone wolf and I don\u2019t know how it could have been prevented,\u201d he said earlier. \n\u201cI can\u2019t get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.\u201d \nAs the investigation continued, details started to emerge in the media about some of the victims \u2013 a kindergarten teacher from California who married her childhood sweetheart; a Tennessee nurse; a high school secretary from New Mexico and a cheerleader, also from California. \nLast night, there were vigils of solidarity with the dead and the wounded. The Empire State Building went dark, as did the Eiffel Tower \u2013 and much of the Las Vegas strip itself. \nPresident Donald Trump denounced what he called \u201can act of pure evil\u201d and said he would visit Las Vegas tomorrow. \nBut the White House pushed back at calls to reopen the US debate on tighter gun controls. \u201cA motive is yet to be determined and it would be premature for us to discuss policy when we don\u2019t fully know all of the facts or what took place last night,\u201d Trump\u2019s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. \nLombardo said Paddock had apparently used some kind of hammer to smash the window of his hotel room before opening fire on the crowd of some 22,000 people. \nIS, which provided no evidence for its claims, described him as a \u201csoldier of the caliphate\u201d saying he converted to Islam several months ago and went by the name Abu Abdel Bar al-Amriki \u2013\u201cThe American.\u201d \nBut the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had found no such link so far. \u201cWe have determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group,\u201d FBI special agent Aaron Rouse said. \nCIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said the intelligence community was aware of the claim but advised \u201ccaution on jumping to conclusions before the facts are in.\u201d   More Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ralph rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lombardo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan liu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen craig paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron rouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph lombardo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abu abdel bar al-amriki", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal bureau of investigation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pomona valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mesquite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eiffel tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:32:56.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13fd1ba2ece4b9ebfe1ea06ae0098144af28fd81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qMV.12_VzYf0wvTmNvW3I5PMAAmTQs1G2N9I3wBPnuYAXgxTBU..6KbvxtyxKwfROCLdP1C_gTfpXtp9MLcRpTrJpbEr2ibm0T1Taw4deSa0jc4zW5gAWu.b4qGI7DCB9K7tcN49R2cJoCFZlb0c.vU", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/world/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "World \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "Las Vegas shooting rekindles debate on gun control laws in US", "title_full": "Las Vegas shooting rekindles debate on gun control laws in US", "published": "2017-10-03T16:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/09/trump-7596.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 36, "comments": 0, "shares": 36}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13fd1ba2ece4b9ebfe1ea06ae0098144af28fd81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qMV.12_VzYf0wvTmNvW3I5PMAAmTQs1G2N9I3wBPnuYAXgxTBU..6KbvxtyxKwfROCLdP1C_gTfpXtp9MLcRpTrJpbEr2ibm0T1Taw4deSa0jc4zW5gAWu.b4qGI7DCB9K7tcN49R2cJoCFZlb0c.vU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Las Vegas shooting rekindles debate on gun control laws in US", "text": "Modified weapons, high perch: why the Las Vegas carnage was different \nThe Las Vegas massacre has triggered a debate on the controversial gun control legislation in the US which has recorded one gun-related incident a day so far this year. Nearly 12,000 people have been killed in gun violence as 273 mass shootings have occurred so far in the US in 2017, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit corporation that tracks gun-related violence in America. \nOn an average, more than 90 Americans lose their lives to gun violence every day, a daily toll of heartbreak and tragedy in communities across the US. At least 59 people were killed and over 500 injured on Sunday night when a gunman opened fire during a music concert in Las Vegas, the deadliest in modern US history. \nExperts believe that the incident, which US President Donald Trump termed as an \u201cact of pure evil\u201d, is unlikely to bridge the bitter differences between the pro- and anti-gun control law lobbies in the country. Trump, who ran his campaign against any gun control laws, did not mention it in his two remarks yesterday even as he said it was \u201ca very very sad\u201d day for him. \nResponding to questions, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said yesterday that it was a day for reflection and mourning and not to discuss political issues. But senior Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi shot off a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan over creation of a Standing Committee on gun violence and passage of a common-sense legislation on gun control. \n\u201cCongress has a moral duty to address this horrific and heartbreaking epidemic. Charged with the solemn duty to protect and defend the American people, we must respond to these tragedies with courage, unity and decisive action,\u201d Congresswoman Pelosi said in the letter. The Congress, she said, must pass the bipartisan King-Thompson legislation to strengthen the life-saving background checks that keep guns out of the wrong hands. \u201cBut this is only a first step,\u201d she added. \nIntroduced in 2015, the King-Thompson bill seeks to expand the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads while providing reasonable exceptions for family and friend transfers. \n\u201cI urge you to create a Select Committee on Gun Violence to study and report back common-sense legislation to help end this crisis. The bipartisan committee would make recommendations to prevent unspeakable tragedies such as the mass shooting in Las Vegas and to restore confidence in the safety of our communities,\u201d Pelosi said. \nIndian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal also made a passionate plea for common-sense gun control law, saying gun violence is a public health crisis that has claimed thousands of innocent lives and the Congress must do everything it can to address it. \nIn her speech on the floor of the US House of Representatives yesterday, Jayapal said the American people were tired of being outraged, sending thoughts and prayers, seeing men, women and children die \u201cbecause the gun lobby does put profit over people\u201d. \u201cThat is not what our founders intended by the \u2018right to bear arms\u2019,\u201d the first-time lawmaker from Washington State said, as she joined several of her Congressional colleagues calling for changes in gun control laws. \n\u201cWith rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to stop gun sales loopholes, to enact protections that make sure our children and those with severe mental illnesses don\u2019t have access to guns, to address funding for mental health, and to oppose any efforts to make it easier to purchase silencers,\u201d Jayapal said. The first ever Indian-American women elected to the House of Representatives said 87 per cent of gun owners and 74 per cent of non-resident aliens (NRA) members support those common-sense solutions like criminal background checks. \nCongresswoman Kathy Castor said, \u201cCertainly, we can come together to pass common-sense safety requirements such as background checks and limits on civilian use of military-style weapons and to enforce the laws on the books. \u201cThe sorrow that I and so many around the country feel for the innocent men and women whose lives were cruelly cut short by this heartless act of domestic terrorism is immeasurable\u201d. \nCongressman Earl Blumenauer said, \u201cFrom Orlando to Roseburg, OR and now Las Vegas, the carnage has only continued. Thoughts and prayers will not stop future tragedy. Enough is enough. My hope is that sanity will prevail, and Republican leadership in Congress will muster up the courage to act.\u201d The right-wing -\u2013 and NRA -\u2013 messaging point that nothing could have been done to prevent the horrific attack in Las Vegas is just wrong, he said. \nOver two years ago, he had released a comprehensive plan to deal with gun violence like the public health epidemic that it is, the lawmaker said, adding that the solutions should not be hard. Congressman Andre Carson said it is time people need to stop hiding behind the false narrative that enacting common sense gun policies somehow limits the rights of law abiding Americans. \n\u201cEvery day that we fail to act puts more innocent lives at risk. It is long past time to fix our gun laws. Congress has a moral responsibility to act and address the daily tragedy of gun violence in our communities,\u201d he said. Last week, he said, Republicans planned to vote on a bill that would loosen gun laws, instead of strengthening them. \nIn light of the tragedy in Las Vegas, and the ongoing tragedy of gun violence in America, this could not be more inappropriate. The American people deserve a vote on legislation that will curb gun violence, including reinstating an assault weapons ban and instituting new restrictions on gun trafficking, Carson said. \nCongressman Alcee L Hastings said that more than 33,000 people will die from gun violence this year. \u201cWith each new tragedy that occurs, those who stand in the way of legislation to address our country\u2019s gun violence epidemic are increasingly culpable for its continuation,\u201d he said. \nNo community should have to fear going to the movies, a concert, or dropping their child off at school, said Ami Bera, the three-term Congressman from California. \u201cIn the wake of this tragedy, I hope we\u2019ll all be able to take the time to look for the helpers and that each of us, in our own way, will seek to help our nation heal, move forward, and work to prevent similar tragedies,\u201d Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat Congressman from 8th district Illinois, said. \u201cWe must end this senseless violence,\u201d said Congressman Ro Khanna, Democrat Congressman from 17th district California.

In a statement circulated on its social media accounts, the group said three of its fighters armed with guns, grenades and explosives were involved in the attack in the southern neighbourhood of Midan on Monday. \nThe Syrian interior ministry said on Monday that the attack involved two suicide bombers, one of whom managed to penetrate the police station and reach the first floor before his explosives detonated. \nBut a monitor reported a third explosion involved a car bomb outside the police station, and the IS claim also referred to the third attacker blowing himself up separately from the other two. \nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, said at least 17 people were killed in the attack, among them 13 police officers. \nDamascus has been largely insulated from the worst of the violence during the country\u2019s brutal six-year civil war, but several bomb attacks have shaken the city. The Midan police station has itself been targeted before. \nIn December 2016, three police officers were wounded when a seven-year-old girl walked into the police station wearing an explosive belt that was remotely detonated. \nThe regime is currently waging several offensives against IS, including in the Badiya desert region and in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. \nThe jihadist group is rapidly losing territory across Syria, though it retains a handful of positions, including in the Yarmuk camp in Damascus. \nMore than 330,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.

Tarik Chadlioui, accused of being a recruiter for the Islamic State (ISIS) through extremist videos, had claimed he is an \u201canti-terrorist preacher\u201d in his bid to fight extradition at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court in London last week. \nHis lawyers were fighting against his extradition on the grounds that it will be \u201ca clear interference with his right to a family life\u201d.

Spanish authorities allege that Chadlioui made three videos for extremist forces in Syria during two visits to Mallorca in 2014 and 2015. \nThe 43-year-old faces a charge of collaboration with, or membership of, an armed group for which the maximum sentence is 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. \u201cHe has uploaded thousands of videos to YouTube. This is what he does, he is an anti-terrorist preacher,\u201d Malcolm Hawkes, Chadlioui\u2019s barrister, had told Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court last week. \nChadlioui, a Moroccan-born Belgian national of Middle Eastern origin, moved to the Sparkhill area of Birmingham in 2015, where he lives with his family comprising eight children. Spanish authorities believe he is behind radicalising one of the terrorists Omar Mostefai who killed 89 music fans at the Bataclan theatre in Paris in November 2015 before blowing himself up. \nHe has also been linked with Anjem Choudary, a radical Muslim cleric currently in a UK jail for supporting the ISIS.

A referendum held on September 25 in the country\u2019s Kurdish-held northern regions delivered an overwhelming \u2018yes\u2019 for independence, raising fears in Iraq and abroad of ethnic strains and a weakening of a US-backed campaign against Islamic State. \nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday Turkey would impose further sanctions on northern Iraq over the vote. Powerful neighbours Ankara and Tehran fear it could fuel Kurdish separatism within their own borders. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), however, has not declared independence and the elections are for the parliament and presidency of the region, not for an independent state. \nBaghdad retaliated to the referendum with an international flights ban on Kurdish airports, while Iran and Turkey launched joint military drills with Iraqi troops at their borders with Iraqi Kurdistan. \nThe Shi\u2019ite Arab-led Iraqi government has rejected a KRG offer to discuss independence. It demanded Kurdish leaders cancel the result of the referendum or face continued sanctions, international isolation and possible military intervention. \nSADDAM OVERTHROW \nMasoud Barzani, the heir of a dynasty who have led a Kurdish struggle for independence for over a century, has held the KRG presidency since its establishment in 2005, two years after the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. \nHis tenure was extended beyond his second term, in 2013, as fresh turmoil engulfed the region and Islamic State overran, in 2014, about a third of Iraq, threatening the Kurdish region. It was unclear whether Barzani would or could stand in the November poll as Kurdish law says a president cannot stay in office for more than two terms. \nCampaigning for the two elections will start on Oct. 15, Rudaw TV cited the High Elections and Referendum Commission chief Hendrean Mohammed. Islamic State\u2019s self-declared \u201ccaliphate\u201d effectively collapsed in July, when their stronghold in Mosul, west of the KRG capital Erbil, fell to a US-backed Iraqi offensive with the participation of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. \nThe Kurdish push for independence is meant to capitalize on their key contribution to the war on Islamic State after the group overwhelmed Iraqi forces in 2014. The US administration, which had strengthened its alliance with Iraq\u2019s Kurds during the war on Islamic State, is taking the side of Baghdad in the crisis, in refusing to recognize the outcome of the referendum.

The shrieking gamblers, the bachelorettes with oversized cocktails, the high-rollers spruced up for an expensive evening out, all were nowhere to be seen.

More than half a million Rohingya have fled from a Myanmar military crackdown in Rakhine State launched in late August that has been denounced by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing. \nMyanmar denies ethnic cleansing, saying it is fighting Rohingya terrorists who have claimed attacks on the security forces. The government has said anyone verified as a refugee will be allowed to return under a process set up with Bangladesh in 1993. \nBangladesh and Myanmar agreed on Monday to work on a repatriation plan, and a Myanmar government spokesman confirmed it would go along with it, provided people could verify their status with paperwork. \nBut many refugees in camps in Bangladesh are scornful. \u201cEverything was burned, even people were burned,\u201d said a man who identified himself as Abdullah, dismissing the chances that people would have documents to prove a right to stay in Myanmar. \nAt the root of the problem is the refusal by Buddhist-majority Myanmar to grant citizenship to members of a Muslim minority seen by a mostly unsympathetic, if not hostile, society as interlopers from Bangladesh. \nThough Myanmar has not granted Rohingya citizenship, under the 1993 procedure, it agreed to take back people who could prove they had been Myanmar residents. But a day after Bangladesh and Myanmar announced apparent progress, a Bangladeshi foreign ministry official appeared resigned to a difficult process. \n\u201cThis is still a long procedure,\u201d said the official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media. There were already nearly 400,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh before the latest exodus, but Myanmar had said it would only accept, \u201csubject to verification\u201d, those who arrived after October 2016, when a military offensive in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, the Bangladeshi official said. \n\u201cWe said that many Rohingya refugees have no documents, so this process should be flexible. Myanmar said they will decide who will get involved in the verification,\u201d the official said, adding that Bangladesh wanted international agencies to be involved. \nMyanmar\u2019s government spokesman said under the 1993 pact, even a hospital record was enough to prove residency, but it was only Myanmar, not Bangladesh, that could verify citizenship. \u201cWe have a policy for the repatriation process and we will go along with that,\u201d the spokesman, Zaw Htay, told Reuters. \n\u2018BREAK THEIR PROMISE\u2019 \nBut even if refugees have documents, many are wary about returning without an assurance of full citizenship, which they fear could leave them vulnerable to the persecution and curbs they have endured for years. Amina Katu, 60, laughed at the thought of returning. \n\u201cIf we go there, we\u2019ll just have to come back here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they give us our rights, we will go, but people did this before and they had to return.\u201d Last month, Anwar Begum told Reuters she had fled from Myanmar three times. The first time was to escape a 1978 crackdown, and she returned the following year. She fled again in 1991 and returned in 1994. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back,\u201d the 55-year-old added. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the government. Every time the government agrees we can go back, then we\u2019re there and they break their promise.\u201d Investigators appointed by government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and led by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan recommended in August that Myanmar review a 1982 law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most Rohingya stateless. \nUN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told a meeting in Geneva on Monday that the link between statelessness and displacement was nowhere more evident than with the Rohingya.\u201cDenial of citizenship is a key aspect of the discrimination and exclusion that have shaped their plight,\u201d he said. \nGrandi called for a two-track approach to tackle issues of citizenship and rights and inclusive development to stamp out poverty in Rakhine State. Separately, the UN refugee agency and Bangladesh authorities are working to contain an outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases in the camps, UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic told a briefing in Geneva. \nRefugees are still crossing into Bangladesh, though at a slower rate, a spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration said. A Reuters photographer saw smoke plumes on the Myanmar side of the border but it was not clear what was alight. \nRights groups say more than half of more than 400 Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine State have been torched. Myanmar officials have said they have attempted to reassure groups of fleeing Rohingya but they could not stop people who were not citizens from leaving.

The president is expected to spend more than five hours on the island, meeting with first responders, local officials and some of the residents struggling to recover from a hurricane that, in Trump\u2019s words, left the island US territory \u201cflattened.\u201d \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left. It\u2019s been wiped out,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cNobody has ever seen anything like it.\u201d \nThe trip will be Trump\u2019s fourth to a region battered by storms during an unusually violent hurricane season that has also seen parts of Texas, Florida, Louisiana and the US Virgin Islands inundated by floodwaters and whipped by winds. \nTrump and first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to attend briefings and meet with Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, as well as the governor of the US Virgin Islands. They\u2019ll also meet with Navy and Marine Corps personnel on the flight Deck of the USS Kearsarge. \nEven before the storm hit on September 20, Puerto Rico was in dire condition thanks to a decade-long economic recession that had left its infrastructure, including the island\u2019s power lines, in a sorry state. Maria was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island in nearly a century and unleashed floods and mudslides that knocked out the island\u2019s entire electrical grid and telecommunications, along with many roads. \nNearly two weeks later, 95 percent of electricity customers remain without power, including some hospitals. And much of the countryside is still struggling to access basic necessities, including food, fresh water and cash. \nTrump and other administration officials have worked in recent days to reassure Americans that recovery efforts are going well and combat the perception that the president failed to fully grasp the magnitude of the storm\u2019s destruction in its immediate aftermath. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday the trip would focus on local recovery efforts, \u201cwhich we\u2019re fully committed to.\u201d \n\u201cThe top priority for the federal government is certainly to protect the lives and the safety of those in affected areas and provide life-sustaining services as we work together to rebuild their lives,\u201d she said. \nWhile early response efforts were hampered by logistical challenges, officials say that conditions, especially in the capital, have improved. \nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there are now more than 10,000 federal officials on the ground on the island, and forty-five percent of customers now have access to drinking water. Businesses are also beginning to re-open, with 60 percent of retail gas stations now up and running. \nFor many, however, that isn\u2019t enough. On Monday, the nonprofit Oxfam announced that it would be taking the rare step of intervening in an American disaster, citing its outrage over what it called a \u201cslow and inadequate response.\u201d   More Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sarah huckabee sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melania trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricardo rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal emergency management agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxfam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marine corps", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:33:03.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f3afa9c3d7ddd2894a73c4fb3f38ae2a3f1f90b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qPKYPp9QuFIplkZ1EF6IApUqCxav10vdyGxZxIRCynRAFsTssnTcGGehRInnEBtyjhmZe0uYhqhG1lP.OMdyQWr6XGGZys4nI8x6synXEpNcg--", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/india/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "India \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "CBI puts Kotkhai suspects under lie detection, narco tests", "title_full": "CBI puts Kotkhai suspects under lie detection, narco tests", "published": "2017-10-03T16:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/09/cbi1.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f3afa9c3d7ddd2894a73c4fb3f38ae2a3f1f90b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qPKYPp9QuFIplkZ1EF6IApUqCxav10vdyGxZxIRCynRAFsTssnTcGGehRInnEBtyjhmZe0uYhqhG1lP.OMdyQWr6XGGZys4nI8x6synXEpNcg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "CBI puts Kotkhai suspects under lie detection, narco tests", "text": "CBI puts Kotkhai suspects under lie detection, narco tests CBI puts Kotkhai suspects under lie detection, narco tests In the narco-analysis test, a truth serum is injected on subjects which put them in a kind of hypnotic state during which questions provided by the CBI are asked by the doctors administering the test. By: PTI | New Delhi | Published:October 3, 2017 7:14 pm Central Bureau of Investigation. At Shimla, police station set on fire, questions loom over a custodial death \nThe CBI has carried out narco-analysis and lie detector tests on the suspects arrested in connection with the alleged rape and murder of a minor girl in the Kotkhai area of Himachal Pradesh\u2019s Shimla district. The agency sources said these tests have been recently carried out but refused to tell which suspect underwent which type of test. \nThe Himachal Pradesh Police had arrested Ashish Chauhan alias Ashu (29), a resident of Sharaal village in Mahasu area of Kotkhai; Rajender Singh alias Raju (32), a driver; Subash Singh Bisht (42) and Deepak alias Deepu (29) and Lok Jung alias Chotu (19), hailing from Nepal, in connection with the case. \nThe sources said tests have been carried out after getting the nod from the competent court in Shimla. \nThe tests and their results are not admissible in the courts as evidence but the agency uses them to get further evidence and indication if any of the suspects is lying in the matter. The sleuths pursue leads given by the suspects in these tests and if any credible corroborative evidence is found, it is used as prosecution evidence. \nIn the narco-analysis test, a truth serum is injected on subjects which put them in a kind of hypnotic state during which questions provided by the CBI are asked by the doctors administering the test. The polygraph test monitors body parameters to find out if the subject is answering correctly or being deceptive. \nOne of the suspects who was also arrested by the state police, Suraj Singh, was found dead in police custody in which a separate case has been registered by the CBI. A 16-year-old girl had gone missing after school hours on July 4 from Haliala forest in Kotkhai area of Shimla district. \nHer naked body was found in the forest on July 6 and the post-mortem report confirmed rape. The rape case has created furore in the state which goes to polls later this year. The DGP constituted a SIT headed by an officer of IG rank which arrested six people. \nThe case was handed over to the CBI by the Himachal Pradesh High Court on July 19 on the state government\u2019s plea amid public outburst against the state police. The CBI filed two FIRs on July 22.

A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar sought the AAP government\u2019s stand on the plea which also wants that the term \u2018senior citizen\u2019 to include parents who have not yet attained that status as they are below 60 years of age. \nThe court directed that the petitioner be given police protection when he visits his house where he has not been staying as he apprehended threat to his life at the hands of his 34-year-old younger son. The bench sought a status report from the police by November 27 on the man\u2019s allegations against his younger son. \nThe petitioner, Ghanshyam Singh Rawat, has alleged that his younger son, along with some associates, had severely assaulted him and tried to kill him when he refused to sell his house and give the proceeds to his son. Rawat claimed that despite lodging a complaint, the police had failed to act against his son. The petitioner, represented by advocate Ashok Agarwal, also claimed that while he was hospitalised after the assault, his son broke into the house and forcibly occupied it. \nIn his plea, Rawat has said that he does not want any maintenance from his son, but only wants to live in peace. He has further claimed that he cannot avail any benefit under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act as it caters only to parents who have attained the status of senior citizen. The petition has sought striking down of the provision in the Act which creates the distinction between parents who are senior citizens and those who are not. \nHe said the Act does not contain any provision to meet the needs of persons like him, who do not seek any maintenance from their children but only wish to be allowed to live in peace. He has also contended that such people need to be protected from hostile and violent children who are only interested in grabbing the properties of their parents and do not care how much suffering they cause.

Hundreds of anxious fans received the superstar outside the Central Jail, where he was lodged since his arrest on July 10. The actor was granted bail on stringent conditions with Justice Suni Thomas warning him not to tamper with evidence. \nThe court has asked Dileep to surrender his passport, deposit a bail bond of Rs one lakh and two personal sureties. The court had previously rejected his bail pleas, this was the fifth such approach by the actor. \nWhat is the controversial abduction case? \nDileep, who has been in the Malayalam film industry for over two decades now has been accused of allegedly conspiring to abduct and sexually assault a leading actress in February this year. After hours of marathon interrogation by the police in July, Dileep was charged with several counts, including conspiracy and gang-rape. He was accused of hiring the gang led by Pulsar Suni to kidnap and torment the woman actor to settle his personal scores. \nAlso Read | Dileep gets bail in actress abduction case: Fans and friends celebrate, others express concern \nThe victim was once close to Dileep\u2019s family, at a time when he was married to popular actress Manju Warrier. But this relationship is believed to have soured after Dileep and Warrier formalised a mutual separation in 2015. Dileep is now married to another popular actress Kavya Madhavan. Dileep\u2019s arrest was based on details provided by the key accused in the case, Sunil Kumar alias Pulsar Suni. \nOn February 17, Kumar allegedly intercepted the car in which the actress was traveling in Kochi, assaulted her inside the vehicle for around two hours and recorded visuals of the act on a mobile phone. \nAlso Read | Malayalam actress abduction case: After 85 days, Dileep walks out of jail \nFollowing the alleged assault, police arrested and chargesheeted a seven-member gang, led by Kumar, on charges of abduction, rape and attempted blackmail. But they continued the probe, with the actress claiming that Kumar had revealed that the abduction was a \u201csupari\u201d and asked her to \u201ccooperate\u201d. \nAfter Dileep\u2019s arrest, his family had accused the police and some Malayalam film industry bigwigs of hatching a conspiracy against Dileep. In a statement, Dileep\u2019s family had said, \u201cDespite completely destroying the life and promising career of Dileep and that of his teenage daughter in the process, a group of unscrupulous senior police officers, a small-but-powerful section of the film industry and scores of obliging media personnel are trying to destroy Dileep\u2019s entire family by implicating Kavya in the case and arresting her.\u201d Dileep fans gather near Aluva Jail. \nThe Victim\u2019s Side \nThe Malayalam actress who was allegedly abducted on the alleged directions of Dileep in a release issued to media claimed that she had personal issues with the arrested actor in the past. She said that the news about the actor\u2019s arrest had shocked her. \n\u201cI haven\u2019t tried to make anyone accused in the case out of personal animosity. I have not dropped any hint about any name. I had acted with this actor in several films.

The Make in India slogan seemed very attractive initially, but its hollowness has begun to show now,\u201d he said at a press conference in Mumbai. \n\u201cThe decisions of demonetisation and GST taken by the prime minister without adequate preparedness has dealt a heavy blow on the country\u2019s economy,\u201d he said. The veteran leader also slammed the Centre over incidents of terrorism in Kashmir, and said there were loopholes in the policies adopted by the government in the Valley. \n\u201cThe government should have demonstrated its willingness to establish a dialogue and resolve issues,\u201d he said. Also taking a dim view of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project, Pawar said technology and modernisation should be feasible. \n\u201cI think a bullet train is required between Mumbai and Delhi or Delhi and Kolkata or Mumbai and Chennai. A bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad is impractical. I do not know what is the purpose behind this bullet train. Maharashtra has barely got 4 stations (to be touched by the bullet train), while the maximum stops are in Gujarat. But, Maharashtra has to contribute equal finance in the project,\u201d he said. \nThe Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, however, hastened to add that he was not against benefits to Gujarat, but only wanted to point out that the project would not benefit Maharashtra. \u201cInstead, the government should have taken steps to improve railway services in Mumbai and Maharashtra,\u201d he said. \nTaking a jibe at Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, Pawar said, \u201cI thought he would have more knowledge about Mumbai\u2019s local trains\u2019 issues as he belongs to the city. Lal Bahadur Shastri had resigned after a train accident. I expected the same action from the railway minister (Goyal) but it did not happen\u201d. \nA video clip was also played at the press meet, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen saying that a bullet train is to showcase the country\u2019s strength. \nCommenting on the issues faced by Maharashtra, Pawar said his party would take a call on launching an agitation over the loan waiver for farmers. \u201cThe chief minister has said that farmers will get a loan waiver by Diwali. But, if that does not happen, we will start an agitation after November 5. There will be a meeting in Aurangabad on November 5 in this regard. We will take the final call at the meeting,\u201d he said. \nThe former chief minister of Maharashtra said he has received various suggestions pertaining to the proposed agitation on loan waiver. \u201cIt includes non-cooperation movement and whether or not farmers should pay taxes to the government,\u201d he said. \nThe NCP chief claimed that the total outgo due to the loan waiver announced by the government would not exceed Rs 12,000 crore because \u201cmost farmers will not be eligible for the scheme due to the government\u2019s impractical norms\u201d. \nAsked about former chief minister Narayan Rane\u2019s decision to launch a party, Pawar said, \u201cHe (Rane) could not even induct his own son in his party. What can I say more about this\u201d? \nPawar declined to comment on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat\u2019s critical remarks against the LDF government in Kerala, in which the NCP is a partner. \u201cI do not take his comments seriously,\u201d he added.

We have got past the first rounds of qualifying and we have two decisive matches, but we have a lot of confidence in our players.\u201d \nAt stake for both teams is a place in a playoff against the fourth-placed team in qualifying from the Concacaf region in November, with the winner of that clash advancing to the finals. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like this,\u201d Socceroos midfielder Massimo Luongo told reporters. \n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably be a little bit tense. A little bit more nerve wracking knowing there\u2019s a lot riding on these games. \u201cWe\u2019re not playing for points, you can\u2019t make up the points later on.

In recent weeks, banking sources say, it has become clear to many UAE bankers that Qatar\u2019s isolation could potentially last for years. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Doha on June 5, alleging Qatar funded terrorism, something it vehemently denies. \nAt the time, UAE banks pulled back from new business with Qatari institutions but largely hung on to existing syndicated loans which they had extended to Qatari banks. Some UAE banks did discuss the possibility of selling off their exposure, but very little of any actual business was done and prospective sellers were reluctant to lower the prices of the loans significantly, the sources said. \nNow, however, the idea has firmed as mediation efforts have made no apparent progress. UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said this week that Qatar knew what it needed to do to end the dispute, so the issue was no longer a priority for the four states. UAE banks holding Qatari loans have become \u201cmore aggressive over the past couple of weeks\u201d in offering the loans for sale in the secondary market, said one banker at a European bank specialising in financial institutions. \nProspective sellers, including First Abu Dhabi Bank , have been in talks with a select group of potential buyers over the past two weeks to sound out their appetite for Qatari bank loans, the sources said. A spokeswoman for First Abu Dhabi declined to comment. \nQatari banks have traditionally relied heavily on external financing and raised over $10 billion through syndicated loans since early 2014, Thomson Reuters data shows. A large proportion of that total was lent by banks in the UAE, the region\u2019s financial centre. \nFirst Abu Dhabi, the largest bank in the UAE, participated in several syndicated loans to Qatari banks over the past few years, including loans to Ahli Bank, Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQ) and Qatar National Bank (QNB). \nLoans to QNB, the country\u2019s largest lender, and CBQ are among assets now being offered for sale, the sources said. A spokesman for QNB said: \u201cIt\u2019s a normal practice in the industry that lenders to banks through syndicated loans sell part or all of their exposure in the secondary market. \n\u201cNevertheless, as far as QNB is concerned, we can confirm that we have not received recently any unusual requests for our approval to sell any exposure to QNB in the secondary market, which is required. Accordingly, we can confirm that there is no systematic selling by banks who participated in QNB syndicated loans.\u201d Spokespeople for CBQ did not respond to emails and telephone calls seeking comment. \nWhile most Qatari loans on offer are to Qatari banks, some corporate and project finance loans are also being offered, the banker at the European institution added. \nHolders of Qatari debt may find it hard to sell without accepting significant discounts. Credit rating agencies have downgraded Qatar since the dispute erupted and all three major agencies have negative outlooks on the country. Qatar\u2019s ratings are still high \u2013 Fitch has it at AA-minus \u2013 but potential buyers may be especially wary of loans with over a year to run, given the risk of the dispute worsening.

A name in the real estate business, Paddock had properties in Texas and was well-known in casinos across Nevada. Eric Paddock, \u2018Stephen\u2019s brother, told the Associated Press that \u201che was a wealthy guy and he liked to play video poker and he liked to go on cruises.\u201d Eric further described his brother as peaceful.

Though, former CM Prem Kumar Dhumal and J P Nadda, both in race for Chief Ministerial posts, were sitting on his left and rights respectively, Modi gave no hint about the party\u2019s Chief Ministerial face in the polls. \nWith eyes clearly on the assembly polls, PM Modi tried to sell the government\u2019s development agenda. He listed out 13 major centrally funded projects worth Rs 1500 crores which the central government will implement in the state for urban development, hydro-power, infrastructure including railway network expansions and Highways. \nHe also claimed that under \u201cPragati\u2019 scheme, he had been reviewing old projects with states\u2019 Chief secretaries, which had been pending for years. One railway project \u2013Una-Nangal had been revived after 40 years while Rs 70 cr Steel processing plant, which he dedicated today for Himachal Pradesh had also been delayed for seven years due to tussle between two departments. \nBeing in Himachal, Modi did try to strike a chord with hundreds of families of ex-servicemen and soliders serving the Indian borders. He announced that last instalment of the OROP worth Rs 8500 crore\u2013a promised he had made in Mandi during his earlier rally, will soon be disbursed . \nOn Bhakra Dam oustees issue, Prime Minister said he understands their pain as hundreds of acres of furtile land was sacrificed by the people of Bilaspur to help in green revolution of the country in states like Rajasthan, Punjab etc. That is the best example of contribution to the development of the country, and agriculture revolution. \nOn AIIMS, Modi said the project will work as \u2018Sanjeevani\u2019 not only for the people of Himachal Pradesh providing best health care but also for the adjoining states. Most important benefit will be to the tourists visiting the state, who sometime fall victim to the road accidents. Once the AIIMS becomes operational, it will also promote tourism in the state, which can be a money spinner for the people besides generating employment avenues for the youths. \nIn his 45 minute speech, Modi also touched upon his \u2018swachhat abhiyan\u2019 for which he claimed women have been a major contributor.

He may have told me if I had asked him two months ago,\u201d Rajinikanth quipped referring to Kamal\u2019s imminent political debut. The actor has met several BJP leaders in the past which lead to intense speculation about him joining the part. The actor had also given his support to BJP\u2019s Clean India Campaign, further fuelling rumours that he might join the saffron party. However, there has been no official clarification from Rajini\u2019s side. The speculations which had lasted years renewed when Rajinikanth had asked his fans to be ready for \u2018war\u2019.

And among many admirers of the gorgeousness of Bhansali\u2019s works is filmmaker Karan Johar , who was earlier reported to have differences with the Padmavati director. \nAt an event today, Karan showered praise on the styling of Bhansali\u2019s films, mentioning his upcoming magnum-opus, Padmavati, in particular. The individual looks of Padmavati\u2019s leading cast members \u2013 Deepika Padukone , Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh \u2013 have been released, and getting unanimous praise from the fans and within the industry. \nSharing his opinion on Deepika\u2019s look from the film, Karan told media persons, \u201cShe looks stunning. That\u2019s one thing about Sanjay Leela Bhansali, his aesthetics are always beautiful, always stunning and the best. His sense of visualisation, beauty is the best we have in the country.\u201d \n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Padmavati looks exceptionally beautiful. All three looks, even the Ranveer Singh look was exotic. Deepika is always eternally beautiful but I think Bhansali makes her look more beautiful,\u201d KJo further said. \nKaran and Bhansali apparently feuded over casting Deepika and Ranveer in their respective films. According to reports, Karan wanted to cast the two actors in his much-talked about and much-delayed film, Shuddhi, after Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor backed out, but before he could do that, SLB signed the young stars in Bajirao Mastani. \nNevertheless, the two directors publicly met earlier this year at a party hosted by Deepika, and also got snapped together. According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, the duo chatted for a good 30 minutes.

But before we get to know more about her, let us give you a short recap about who is Lucinda Nicholas. An Australian model, Lucinda is an actor who wants to make a career in Indian film industry. She has been a yoga instructor for over 10 years now. She was seen in Hindi serial Pardes Mein Hai Mera Dil. She also appeared in some dance numbers down south and has done several brand endorsements. \nBeyond her career achievements, Lucinda is also studying law. She came to India in 2013 and made her Bollywood debut with a feature film, \u201cBoss\u201d where she was selected to act and dance alongside Akshay Kumar and Yo Yo Honey Singh in the popular song \u2018Party All Night\u2019. However, she decided to return to her studies and had flown back to Australia. \nMeanwhile, Lucinda featured as the lead actor in French Producer Watermat\u2019s song \u2018Bullit\u2019 (2014), which reached number 2 on the Belgium charts and number 4 on the UK Dance Charts. In May of 2015, she also became the first South Australian female to feature in the Australian edition of the internationally-recognised MAXIM magazine where she featured in a six page spread. \nShe came back to India last year and has been learning more about yoga since then. On the Bigg Boss premiere episode, she left an impression on Salman Khan by naming yoga postures in Sanskrit. In a Hindi speaking show, Lucinda is trying her best to converse in the language she has been learning for the last one year. \nAt present, she has not yet entered the main house of madness in the show but we are sure just like other non-Hindi speaking contestants in Bigg Boss so far, this season 11 contestant will also gain some name and fame among the audience. \nCheck out Lucinda Nicholas pictures: \nCheck out Lucinda Nicholas videos", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bigg boss", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "modi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "prakash raj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yogi adityanath", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lucinda nicholas profile", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "watermat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yo yo honey singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akshay kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucinda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salman khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucinda nicholas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "maxim", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bigg boss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:48:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58ea517e60d77476aba7ffd235c15523231d1627", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qMkK707uLUhVq0i.L26ZPTP6Ki5bNC6Jox1BVOdNnq_lARMpAYPyXtSgOiOqUI0bzqYvMKgiElU27ZiIMa3877p42WSJidObHTN5EYN_3SPwOnyHaJ0mNjdwStKhSBfYLsJ1UIGwvGffjwU35LSYBAz", "site_full": "indianexpress.com", "site": "indianexpress.com", "site_section": "http://indianexpress.com/section/entertainment/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entertainment \u2013 The Indian Express", "title": "Bigg Boss 11 who is Priyank Sharma Profile, Biography, Photos and Video", "title_full": "Bigg Boss 11 who is Priyank Sharma Profile, Biography, Photos and Video", "published": "2017-10-03T17:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/10/priyank-759.jpg?w=759", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 598, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3475, "comments": 0, "shares": 3475}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58ea517e60d77476aba7ffd235c15523231d1627", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_powd1Yb2vRs6mTxdm9hYUwO2jw1hyNMa3qMkK707uLUhVq0i.L26ZPTP6Ki5bNC6Jox1BVOdNnq_lARMpAYPyXtSgOiOqUI0bzqYvMKgiElU27ZiIMa3877p42WSJidObHTN5EYN_3SPwOnyHaJ0mNjdwStKhSBfYLsJ1UIGwvGffjwU35LSYBAz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "A.

Apparently, while travelling with her husband Vivek Dahiya, Divyanka had to report on the sets at a scheduled time. But an unprecedented delay by the airline made it impossible for her to reach on time, that too without any explanation as she intimidated to her fans on her social handle. \nDivyanka wrote, \u201c@JetAirways heights of irresponsibility!
