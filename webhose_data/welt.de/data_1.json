Tatort ist das Wandsbek Quarree, ein Einkaufszentrum im Osten der Stadt .\nDie jungen M\u00e4nner hielten sich in der H&M-Filiale des Einkaufszentrums auf. Dabei beobachtete der 24 Jahre alte Ladendetektiv, wie die beiden Sicherheitsetiketten von mehreren Kleidungsst\u00fccken entfernten. Das Diebesgut verstauten sie in einer mitgebrachten Tasche. Da es sich offenbar um einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Coup handeln sollte, platzierten sie weitere Kleidungsst\u00fccke mit ebenfalls entfernten Diebstahlsicherungen im Laden \u2013 vermutlich f\u00fcr eine sp\u00e4tere Abholung.\nAls die M\u00e4nner die Filiale kurz vor 17 Uhr verlie\u00dfen, folgte der Ladendetektiv den beiden und sprach sie vor dem Gesch\u00e4ft an. \u201eAls der 24-J\u00e4hrige die beiden M\u00e4nner aufforderte, die Tasche zu \u00f6ffnen, soll einer der mutma\u00dflichen Ladendiebe ein Messer gezogen und hiermit mehrfach auf den Gesch\u00e4digten eingestochen haben, der schlie\u00dflich zu Boden ging\u201c, beschreibt eine Polizeisprecherin die Eskalation.\nEin Mann wird vorl\u00e4ufig festgenommen Anzeige Nach der Tat fl\u00fcchteten beide, einer in Richtung Wandsbeker Marktstra\u00dfe , der andere in eine bislang unbekannte Richtung.

However, selling clothes is not all Cinar cares about. Anzeige\nEzgi Cinar Quelle: Ezgi Cinar/PR/OLIVER RUST\nAnzeige 1. What did you want to become when you were little?\nA secret agent.\nAnzeige 2. What did your favourite outfit look like as a kid?\nA red velvet dress with a white lace collar, combined with matching white lace socks and patent black Mary Jane shoes. I would still wear that outfit.\n3. What is your first important memory regarding fashion?\nAnzeige The stories my grandma and grand aunt, who both loved fashion, told me. For example, that they used to go down to the harbour when the big ships were entering the Istanbul port, intending to buy shoes off women coming from Paris. Gems like those just weren\u2019t available in Istanbul at that time\u2026 I always used to visualise those stories, how they, young women so passionate about fashion , went treasure hunting. I think this is when my interest in fashion seriously awoke.\nEzgi Cinar states that the word fairytale describes her clothing and this AW 17 dress perfectly demonstrates that Quelle: Ezgi Dinar/PR\n4. When did you decide to become a designer?\nNever. I prefer to think of myself as a Creative Director, turning phantasies into reality. Beginning with the design of the dresses to the concept of photo shoots to my website. I do not want to simply sell dresses, I like to create a story, a whole world around each collection and every piece, and to convey that corresponding lifestyle.\n5. How often did you want to quit being a designer?\nNever. Even before I knew, there is something like a fashion industry and a whole machinery behind it, I always wanted to surround myself with beautiful things. And it will never change.\n6. What is the most annoying thing about the fashion scene?\nThe widely held mindset of fast food fashion.\nRead another episode from our Ask a Designer series here\nQuestionnaire Ask a Designer \u2013 Episode 4 with Karen Phelps from Goldsign 7.

Which achievement are you most proud of when it comes to your brand?\nHaving been able to place Ezgi Cinar at the two only luxury department stores in Switzerland as the only Swiss designer beside Akris, and simultaneously going internationally with Moda Operandi after only one year on the market. And without wanting to sound arrogant, I knew from the very beginning that the brand would be a success, I just didn\u2019t expect it to be so quick. And this makes me very proud.\nWe ask every designer featured in this series to draw a picture of themself. Well, Ezgi Cinar \"cheated\" a little bit and asked the artist Clinton Bopp to portray her \u2013 the result i ... s beautiful anyway Quelle: Ezgi Dinar/PR\n10.

From Autumn/Winter 2017/18 it is the Morpheus dress & the Eos pyjama suit.\n11. Which song gets you in a creative mood?\nIt\u2019s also different each season. I use to play it up and down till everybody around me is getting crazy, hahaha. For AW 17 it was \u201cEnglishman in New York\u201c from Sting, for SS18 it is \u201cNo Roots\u201c from Alice Merton. My absolute favourite, that never disappoints, is \u201cWalking in My Shoes\u201c from Depeche Mode.\nThe Morpheus dress is one of Ezgi Cinar's favourite pieces from her AW 17 collection Quelle: Ezgi Dinar/PR\n12.

However, Tilda Swinton, Natalie Portman or Poison Ivy from Batman have a great sense of style.\n13.

It\u2018s easy to guess which super food is being discussed. We visited The Avocado in Berlin, a pop up with many avocado based options.\nI t\u2019s no secret that avocados are not only delicious but also incredibly healthy for you. Avocados have a list of benefits ranging from a great source of Vitamin E and monounsaturated fat, to having more potassium than a banana. Of course, avocados are the trend food of the moment, a favourite among hipsters, millennials, and the average restaurant-goer, with over 6.7 million posts on Instagram with the tag avocado, and over 500,000 posts with the tag avocado toast.\nThere are millions of avocado Instagram photos, but also millions of autumnal landscapes\nGlobal Diary What is there to love about Autumn, if Summer is your favourite season? It\u2018s nearly unheard of to look at a restaurant\u2018s breakfast menu and not see an avocado option, the most common being the avocado toast. According to Australian millionaire Tim Gurner , millennials must stop buying avocado toast if they want to buy a house. It\u00b4s no surprise that this dark green fruit has become the star of the menu in multiple restaurants. The Avocado , a pop up in the restaurant Petit Bijou in Berlin, is the first restaurant in Berlin to experiment with this concept.\nThe menu at The Avocado delivers exactly what it promises: Avocado! And not only the Hipster staple \u201cAvocado on Toast\u201d. A popular example are avocado pancakes, , served with either fried eggs, or berries and maple syrup. Whilst the pancakes mimic the avocado in colour, they don\u2018t have an overpowering flavour of avocado, making it suitable for different sides. But for those people not on board with this particular trend, but want to accompany a avocado-crazed friend to the restaurant, there are many non-avocado options to try, like sandwiches, salad bowls, and traditional egg based breakfast options. And of course, in true nutritional zeitgeist, there are plenty of vegan-friendly options.\nAnzeige Some other avocado based options on the menu are: avocado \u201cwings\u201d; avocado slices coated in popping quinoa, an avocado filled with chicken, salmon and a poached egg, and an avocado Caesar salad, with avocado replacing the chicken, and an avocado dressing.\nThese avocado \"wings\" are one of the many vegan options, coated in popping quinoa Quelle: The Avocado\nSo how does a French restaurant turn into a pop up, avocado-loving eatery? Maria Ursula G\u00fcnther, Head of Social Media, explained that the restaurant wanted to focus more on superfoods, and of course, while thinking about which item of food is the \u201cicon\u201d of superfoods, the team settled on avocado. And since the whole team liked avocado, they started work on their new, super menu.\nMaria explained that the avocado concept had received a good reaction, that on weekends, especially when the sun is shining, the pop up is so full that the staff have trouble keeping up!\nNot only does Petit bijou offer an interesting menu, but the perfect location to relax- it is located right by the Spree Quelle: The Avocado\nAnzeige The Avocado is the current pop up in Petit Bijou, but Maria also let slip that there is a brand-new concept coming soon, however, sadly this is being kept a big secret for the time being. How intriguing!\nThe menu isn\u2018t the only reason to pop into the pop up. Petit bijou is right on the border of Berlin\u2018s river, the Spree , next to the Museum Island, so it has a great view. Maria explained that the team\u2019s goal is to go beyond a culinary experience that focuses on the taste buds, to providing a great overall experience, creating an ambience that strikes that delicate balance between trendy and homely. The Avocado even hosts events.\nThe Avocado , Monbijoustra\u00dfe 2, 10117 Berlin\nFollow us under the name ICONISTbyicon on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T12:17:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f5821c95bb07e6296c2175a50670c4aac1e6aaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJmlZEzdUAlaWNKbv3fCd82o6rWIRlG.zozc5ADcryVY4Q0pOp3Qi670iYRFc.1T6MaU0hOcIkYHxC.KFy67fQfONsssm1UL1Ok8vI.9DZy9PuxoiWz3Pepwe7dXDCW1_RK099RjgT9A--", "site_full": "www.welt.de", "site": "welt.de", "site_section": "http://feeds.n24.de/n24/news_stories", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nachrichten - WELT", "title": "A hotel that is like a village that you don\u2019t need to leave", "title_full": "A hotel that is like a village that you don\u2019t need to leave", "published": "2017-10-17T11:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.welt.de/img/icon/mobile165276857/9801351707-ci16x9-w1200/The-Sanya-EDITION-Hainan-Island-Ian-Sc-4.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1319, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 9, "comments": 0, "shares": 9}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f5821c95bb07e6296c2175a50670c4aac1e6aaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJmlZEzdUAlaWNKbv3fCd82o6rWIRlG.zozc5ADcryVY4Q0pOp3Qi670iYRFc.1T6MaU0hOcIkYHxC.KFy67fQfONsssm1UL1Ok8vI.9DZy9PuxoiWz3Pepwe7dXDCW1_RK099RjgT9A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laura Ewert", "published": "2017-10-17T11:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "A hotel that is like a village that you don\u2019t need to leave", "text": "The Studio 54 founder Ian Schrager has opened a hotel in Hainan. The hotel is its own small world, with an art gallery and a karaoke bar. The visit of an island, overflowing with attractions.\n\u201eIt might the biggest luxury, right?\u201c my colleague from Miami asks, who was also invited on this trip, raising his coconut in the air to cheers. \u201eTravelling to places that you didn\u2019t know that they existed!\u201d The island\u2019s airport is in Sanya, the capital city of Hainan. This is the most southern point in China, and you should have visited China to understand the extent of the world. Hainan is a holiday island, known as Asia's Hawaii, and it\u2019s even becoming the Chinese Dubai, with enormous construction projects being built in a record time, in the air and on water.\nWhoever has already visited Thailand, will not be a stranger to the nature and people here, and neither to the streets with open store-fronts, where piles of tropical fruits tower inside.\nThere are streets with rows and rows of cook shops and plastic chairs placed in front of them. One of the main differences between Asians and Europeans is that they don\u2019t wear helmets. Here they don\u2019t either.\nOther places for vacation\nRecommendation Where to relax? The best hotels for every type of traveller Anzeige We drive past mopeds and honking cars and we take the Haitang Bay exit. The American hotel \u201eEdition\u201c has its largest branch here. The infrastructure reminds guests of the United Arab Emirates ; an international shopping centre, and buildings so brightly lit that they make you wince.\nThe hotel area is like a luxury entertainment park, with hotels, restaurants and dolphins. It has been under construction since 2013 and openend this summer. The creaking cranes represent the future and the conical straw hats represent the past.\nIan Schrager opened the first \u201eEdition\u201d hotel. He is one of the founders of the New York club \u201eStudio 54\u201d, that opened in London in 2013. The 70-year-old entrepreneur intends to open more \u201eEdition\u201d hotels, in Bangkok, Bali, or Barcelona in the future. \u201eEdition\u201d already has hotels in New York, Istanbul, London, and now in China. \u201eI actually see us as more of an Entertainment company\u201d he says during a press conference via Skype. He wears blue jeans and has white hair, like an employee of his \u201eEdition\u201d team, and he seems to be incredibly friendly.\nHere live very friendly people, too\nGlobal Diary How about a holiday in Albania? Anzeige The creative directors of his hotels seem like they came out of a hipster dictionary, you want to be friends with all of them immediately, or at least drink a beer with them. In the \u201eEdition\u201d hotels the beer comes from a local brewery, and the labels are designed by Wes Anderson\u2019s brother.\nThe guests are greeted by a gate that\u2019s as big as an aircraft hangar, and the bamboo groves look almost small next to it. \u201eSpace is another luxury of our time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d my colleague asks again, and glances at the breakfast restaurant, that resembles a street food market.\nOn the property that is bigger than 200,000 square meters, you can find more than 500 rooms and 20 villas, four restaurants, a private beach, a playground, bumper cars, minigolf, an art gallery, a bookstore and a 3D karaoke bar, and there\u2019s also a business centre. And of course, there\u2019s also a spa which offers a western luxury trend, perhaps involuntarily - digital detox. Even though China is modern, it is difficult to access Google Mail, Facebook and other websites because of political reasons.\nNeed some interior inspiration?\nQuestionnaire Ask a Designer, episode 3: Ruth Wassermann from made.com In the morning, the concierge asks us whether we saw the sun rise. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t manage, because we had to try the bathtub on the balcony. Every room has a sea view. Because the waves are too dangerous to swim in, there\u2019s an artificial beach in front of the actual beach . The artificiality isn\u2019t bothersome, because you swim in filtered seawater in an infinity pool, that deserves the name.\n\u201eIt\u2019s like a village, that you don\u2019t need to leave\u201c, says Ian Schrager. An all-inclusive package , only without holiday entertainers. The area is also nice, there is the Nanshan Temple, where buses are stuck in traffic in the weekend, because a group of cows has gathered in the parking lot.\nThere is statue of Guanyin, a Buddhist goddess, in front of the sea, in which men seek strength.

So what do you expect the EU will offer? \nDavid Davis: I cannot predict what they will do. What we know from discussions with Michel Barnier is that he is looking for a bit more leeway in his mandate. He has had a pretty tight mandate so far. We would also like him to be able to talk about the transition period, or implementation period as we call it, we distinguish there. Also we\u2019d like him at least to prepare for the future relationship. Some people say progress is slow. By EU standards this negotiation has been lightening fast. \nDIE WELT: Why did you agree to a mandate that first settles three issues: Northern Ireland, money and EU citizens? Anzeige \nDavis: Careful, the words were sufficient progress. We did not choose the structure. We understand sufficient progress will not be a number on money, not completion. \nDIE WELT: But there is deadlock on the money, so why are you not accepting the framework? \nDavis: Because sufficient progress is a judgment for the EU Council to make. The other concern is: It is widely accepted it was a seminal speech in Florence. The Prime Minister volunteered that nobody would pay more or receive less in the current EU budget. This is quite a generous position. She did not limit it to that. But the truth is, in order to make this judgement -- we are talking about taxpayers\u2019 money, not Monopoly money. So, we have to judge the thing in the round. Remember if we come back with an overarching agreement, as the EU favourite saying goes, nothing is agreed until anything is agreed: It will come back to Parliament, on behalf of British people. And they will make a decision on the whole package. Anzeige \nDIE WELT: So, in your view, has sufficient progress been achieved? \nDavis: We think we made progress. But it is not our criteria. It is the Council\u2019s words. As far as we can resolve [the issues at stake] we have done a pretty good job of doing it. Two or three issues remain. It was not like we fix that first and everything else second. It was an attempt to be constructive. We have aimed throughout this whole exercise to be reasonable. \nDIE WELT: On the money, the European Parliament\u2019s President Antonio Tajani has said that 20 billion Euro is peanuts, a more realistic figure being 50 or 60. Do you still think that 50 billion is \u201cnonsense\u201d? \nDavis: Look, this is a negotiation and we want to resolve this in a way which meets our international obligations. I used that phrase because we don\u2019t think that the legal argument stands up so we do it a different way. But it\u2019s a negotiation and we\u2019re going through the process at the moment of assessing, do the technical work on the commitments. We\u2019ll then make a political judgement on what we think is realistic and sensible. But that\u2019s a judgement that should be informed by everything, informed by the whole deal, not informed by a figure picked out of the air. I\u2019m not going to pick figures out of the air. \nDIE WELT: In your view, is the EU Commission ready to go further but are being stopped from doing so by some countries, namely Germany and France? Are there some countries that are more understanding of your position? \nDavis: Of course, you get differences of views among the 27 but let me make one point right up-front. I want the 27 to work together on this. It would be impossible for us to do 27 different negotiations or even three or four different negotiations in different blocks. It\u2019s almost as important to us as to the Commission that they operate together. But of course, in the course of the negotiation different countries are going to see their interests in different ways. Let me give you some obvious examples. On citizens\u2019 rights, countries like Poland and Lithuania have very large numbers of young citizens working here, would have a different view to other countries. Countries like Italy who have a lot of people here who have been here much longer may have a different angle. \nDIE WELT: It\u2019s widely expected that the European Council will say that there has not been sufficient progress yet. Whose fault is this? \nDavis: The first thing I have to say is I hope they recognise there\u2019s been significant progress. It\u2019s not just words. Sufficient progress is their test, not our test. \u201cSufficient\u201d is up to them, \u201csignificant\u201d is not up to them. In citizens\u2019 rights alone there has been major progress. My hope is that, whatever the criteria, whatever the process, we don\u2019t let the process get in the way of progress. That actually we get an outcome on Friday, in the medium term, which is beneficial for everybody. That we are not left with a straight no. I also think that it\u2019s important, in European political terms, that the Council recognises that the Prime Minister took quite a bold stance. In some sense it was a high risk stance, of putting out the Florence speech. I think the reaction was very positive. Friday should reflect that too. \nDIE WELT: Some people in your government believe the slow progress is quite deliberate on the part of some member states because uncertainty provides opportunities to some EU countries to attract more business. Do you agree some are trying to benefit from slow progress? \nDavis: I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d take the view there\u2019s a deliberate slowing of the process. I wouldn\u2019t subscribe to that. Of course, in a circumstance like this, every nation state would want to play for its own economic advantage. That is natural. I don\u2019t believe I live in a world of saints. So, it is natural that there would be a certain amount of competition, particularly in the City business. But the truth be told, the City will still be there in five years, it\u2019ll still be the biggest and most powerful financial centre in the world, and that is because of things that are independent to this process: the centrality, the time zone, the language, the law. The things that make the City be in London are not going to be altered much with this process. Some pieces might move as a result maybe of European laws, but that\u2019s something we will negotiate later. But that\u2019s more by comparison with a large entity of, in round numbers, 300bn euros worth trade to us from the EU and about 230-240bn sales to EU. So that\u2019s the big number. It\u2019s not for me to advice other European governments, but if I were to draw their attention to them I would say those are the big numbers. Don\u2019t risk the big numbers for small numbers. \nDIE WELT: On citizens\u2019 rights you said there has been big progress but there are still unsolved questions regarding family rights and there are bright red lines in terms of the role of the European Court of Justice. How will you solve this issue? \nDavis: Let me deal with family rights, which is most difficult first. The issue is that in order to give perpetuity on family rights it would give to three million people in the UK rights that British citizens themselves don't have. I am trying to think of a way of maybe a short-term way of sorting this, a certain window whatever. \nDIE WELT: Five years, ten years? \nDavis: Whatever that might be, might be a bit shorter than that. We haven't engaged on that negotiation properly, it's next on the agenda. We will talk about that. Let me now deal with the more difficult one. That's the ECJ. What we are trying to do is we are trying to take what is the reason for this. The reason for this is to give certainty to European citizens, and to make sure that the treatment on both sides of the Channel is equal, or equivalent. We have come up with mechanisms to make the law and whatever we agree on in the treaty, which will be detailed, unusually detailed, carried straight into the British law, and the court can look into the treaty, and the details of the agreement. \nWe think that will deliver. Some tweaks in the law so a future government if it actually intends to change this have to say it explicitly, cannot slip through secondary legislation, but has to be very explicit about it. I think that gives fantastic guarantees, particularly if you bear in mind that our courts for 200 years have been overturning government's decisions, so they are not patsies. \nThe other thing to say is that no other country in the world that is either a member of the EU or transitioning into the EU accepts the European court. Europeans in America don't have protection of the ECJ, Americans in the UK have no protection from the Supreme Court. There is a point at which we have to say this is a good judicial system, one of the best in the world. \nOne other point is my own position in this. Before I took this job on, I spent the previous ten years causing the government trouble on civil rights, judicial, and I indeed took the government to court. I am not going to sign up to something that doesn't give rock solid protection. \nDIE WELT: So, the EU has to budge on the red line of ECJ? \nDavis: Well, I don't do public red lines myself. Quite pointedly if you follow me I don't do that. But I don't see the EU has made a red line of it. What is has said is that it must reflect their rights, that's the point, and they must be guaranteed properly. The Council guidelines anyway didn't require the ECJ oversight and I think we will get to position where we can produce something that is acceptable to the EU, and it will meet the requirements of citizens. \nDIE WELT: In the worst case scenario of the negotiations, you are saying the no-deal option is on the table and the UK is considering a no-deal outcome. How likely is it and how much do you prepare the country for it? \nDavis: The first thing to say is that it is a) not our intention, b) I don't think it is a probability, I think it is a very distant possibility. That being said, we have to prepare for it. I mean, a responsible government prepares for all outcomes, and we are doing that. It is no part of our negotiating strategy, and no plan of our planning for the future in terms of what we intend, it is just a security thing, like anything else you do on security, you produce your own insurance policy. \nDIE WELT: As the Kissinger question goes: When you need to call Europe who do you call? Who does Europe call to understand the UK\u2019s position? \nDavis: You want my number? \nDIE WELT: That would be very nice but you cannot deny that the government is divided? \nDavis: This is the most detailed set of policies I have even had to deal with as a minister. It started with the Lancaster House speech agreed unanimously by the cabinet, the A50 letter agreed unanimously, the two white papers about the progress agreed unanimously at the cabinet, the fourteen documents over the summer agreed unanimously by the cabinet... \nDIE WELT: What about Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u2019s interventions ahead of the Florence speech? \nDavis: Wait a minute. The Florence speech was agreed unanimously by the Cabinet. On the substantive issues, there is unanimity. Of course, there is debate. This is a live democracy, and this is a debate about what is the best way to do things, and I do debate with myself sometimes what the best thing is. \nYou will see there will be lots and lots of arguments about pieces of it. That is what a living democracy is about. We have always been like this. One of the differences between us and some other countries is when you look at our chamber, the House of Commons, we face each other, it is not a semi-circle, we argue, we fight, and we get hopefully a good outcome at the end of it. \nDIE WELT: Is Michel Barnier your dream Brexit partner? \nDavis: I like him. In fact, here is the walking stick he gave me as a present. We have a common interest in mountains. So, this is going to take a lot of determination, the ability to keep your eye on the peak as you are covering the steps along the way, and the ability to deal with odd blizzard, odd rock fall, and still get past it. The requirements of this are continued determination and optimism, something we both said at the first press conference. \nMichel is a good man, a straight-forward man. He has been around in Brussels for a long time, so he knows how it will work. I am sure he wants a positive outcome. Remember: good negotiators want an outcome that is good for both sides. Not some match or contest. That is what we\u2019re going to get. \nDIE WELT: Has your training in the British commandos helped you as a negotiator? \nDavis: Well, I never killed anyone! \u00a9 WeltN24 GmbH.

F\u00fcr die Fahrer bedeutet das zwar eine Umstellung. Doch die neue Fokussierung der Rennserie ist alternativlos.   Anzeige \nD er letzte Satz des legend\u00e4ren Ringsprechers Michael Buffer hatte es in sich: \u201eDrivers, start your engines\u201c, verlangte der 72-J\u00e4hrige am Sonntag nach der knapp 20-min\u00fctigen Er\u00f6ffnungsshow wie sie die Formel 1 noch nicht erlebt hat. Was Buffer vermutlich nicht wusste: In der modernen Formel 1 lassen die Piloten die Motoren nicht selbst an, streng genommen kommt die Energie auch nicht mehr aus herk\u00f6mmlichen Motoren. Teams von Ingenieuren starten die hoch komplexen Hybrid-Antriebsstr\u00e4nge, erst dann kann das Rennen losgehen.\nTrotzdem schwang in Buffers Aufforderung eine Wahrheit mit. Das Rennen in den USA, der Heimat der neuen Eigent\u00fcmer von Liberty Media, gab einen Vorgeschmack auf die Zukunft der Formel 1. Die soll verst\u00e4ndlicher und nahbarer werden. Und vor allem soll sie die wahren Stars wieder in den Fokus r\u00fccken: Die Piloten.\n\nRingsprecher-Legende Michael Buffer bei der Formel 1 Quelle: AFP/GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/Mark Thompson\nDas gelang mit der Zeremonie. Und wie: Jeder Pilot wurde einzeln auf den roten Teppich in der Startaufstellung gerufen. Nebel, Musik, Jubel der Fans inklusive. Den lautesten Applaus bekam in Ermangelung eines echten Lokalmatadoren selbstverst\u00e4ndlich Lewis Hamilton, der zuvor bereits eine ganz besondere Spritztour unternommen hatte.\nAnzeige Mit 100-Meter-Weltrekordler Usain Bolt auf dem Beifahrersitz war er einige Runden um den Circuit of the Americas gerast. Der Leichtathletik-Superstar aus Jamaika litt anschlie\u00dfend sichtlich unter den wilden Man\u00f6vern seines Chauffeurs, die Massen auf den Trib\u00fcnen johlten vor Vergn\u00fcgen (Hamilton hatte ebenfalls seinen Spa\u00df).\nFormel 1 steht unter Druck All das bedeutete nat\u00fcrlich eine Abkehr vom normalen Prozedere. Die Fahrer mussten ihre sensiblen Autos fast eine halbe Stunde allein in der Startaufstellung stehen lassen, kein Mechaniker mit Laptop konnte noch Feinjustierungen vornehmen. Ja und?

What he really preaches, what the ministers pray for and Trump's reaction - an exclusive interview.\nThe Capitol Hill Club is Washington's most important meeting place for Republican politicians. It is situated in a white town house with a long, green canopy over the entrance, just a block away from the Capitol. It is a closed society. Only members and invited guests are granted access, and you have to be nominated by two members in order to become one yourself.\nThe Club advertises itself as \u201ca home away from home,\u201d a safe space for elected representatives in Washington whose actual homes are often thousands of miles away. Here, under the gaze of portraits of Nixon, Bush, and Reagan, they can withdraw for private conversations. The high density of Republican representatives, senators and ministers, coupled with the high level of discretion, make the Capitol Hill Club one of the most popular spots for Washington's army of lobbyists.\nVisitors who enter through the brown double doors arrive in a carpeted foyer and have to report to reception on the right before they are allowed to turn into one of the corridors or climb up the gently winding staircase, framed by two carved elephants. It is the middle of an October day. White men and women in dark suits, with Stars and Stripes buttons on their lapels, stride back and forth in the lobby whispering or sit waiting for their appointments in thick leather armchairs. There are also two black men: A security man at the entrance and, beside a raised chair, a shoe shiner. There is a photo of Donald Trump next to reception. He is giving a cheerful thumbs up to newcomers, as if to congratulate them on having penetrated so deeply into the heart of America\u2019s power.\nA rather unusual Bible study Anzeige \u201cMr. Drollinger usually dines in the large hall on the first floor,\u201d the receptionist tells me. \u201cYou can just go up and see if he's already there.\u201d\nUpstairs, an usher checks the guest list before leading me to a round four-person table in the far corner of the hall. Ralph Drollinger is already there, accompanied by his wife Danielle. Both politely stand to greet me. Drollinger is impossibly tall. He was 2.18 meters as a young man, he tells me, when he was still playing in the NBA. Today, at 63, he is supposedly a little shorter. But if he\u2019d told me that since his time in the NBA he had grown a meter taller, I\u2019d have believed him.\nRalph Drollinger doesn\u2019t play basketball any more; he damaged his knees playing professionally and now cannot even play for fun. But in his second life, in his second job, Drollinger is far more successful than he ever was as a sportsman. He works as a Bible preacher. And it would be easy to argue that he is the most influential Bible preacher in the world.\nAnzeige Drollinger, an ultraconservative evangelical Christian, has been running an organization called \"Capitol Ministries\" (CapMin) for the last 20 years. It offers devout Bible courses for politicians. The aim is to convert as many parliamentarians as possible, in America and around the world, to evangelical Christianity. In 2017, CapMin took a huge step forward: Since March of this year, Ralph Drollinger has been giving a weekly Bible course to Donald Trump's cabinet. Soon he will be holding these meetings in the White House itself, right next to the Presidential Office in the West Wing. This is rather unusual. There was a Bible circle in the White House under George W. Bush, but only for lower-ranking employees, of their own accord. According to Drollinger, there hasn\u2019t been a course for ministers for at least a hundred years, and if something similar existed in the White House before then, it is not known about.\n\u201eThat was your idea, do you remember?\u201c In his Bible studies, which you can download each week from the CapMin website, Drollinger interprets the Bible literally. He believes the world was created in six days; he rejects the notion of man-made climate change as hubris and warns against the sin of homosexuality. There are many preachers in America who share his beliefs. But none of those before him had the opportunity to spend an hour each week as a spiritual leader converting the government of the United States superpower to his worldview.\nWhen CapMin's involvement in Trump\u2019s cabinet became public a few months ago, all the main US media outlets wanted to interview Drollinger, from \" Newsweek \" and \" NBC News \" to \" The Wall Street Journal \" . Drollinger refused all media requests. \"We don\u2019t trust American journalists, they just make things up.\" After long consideration, he finally agreed to give Welt am Sonntag a detailed exclusive interview.\nBefore the interview can begin, Drollinger has to extend his entire two meter body once more because a congressman is approaching the table, a CapMin supporter from the House of Representatives. \u201cRalph!\u201d. They shake hands. Standing, Drollinger tells the Republican that his Bible studies will now be available to download as audio. \u201cThat was your idea, do you remember? You wanted to listen to them while driving.\u201d Then Drollinger pulls a brochure of his current sermon out of his briefcase and pushes it into his hand.\n\u201cThere are a lot of good people here,\u201d says Drollinger, once the congressman has left. \"Good, devout people.\n***\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Mr. Drollinger, how did you make it into the White House?\nRalph Drollinger: We wouldn\u2019t be where we are now if it weren\u2019t for some Christian politicians who kind of pulled us along with them as their careers advanced. In 2010 we were working hard to establish a ministry in the House and in the end we rode in on the coat tails of congressman Trent Franks, who\u2019s a really highly respected Christian. So he brought us in and we rode on his ethos and we started the House ministry. Then five years into the House ministry, four of the guys in the House study won the senate and they said: \u201cCome on over here with us!\u201d And so now we have twelve of about 100 senators in our Bible study and they\u2019re really the young ones, they\u2019re the future leaders. When Trump won the presidency and chose Pence, Pence chose a bunch of the strongest believers out of the House Bible study and out of the senate Bible study. And again those guys say: \u201cCome with us, we love the high protein diet of the Word of God that you\u2019ve been giving us.\u201d So now we have three Bible Studies in Washington: One for the House on Mondays, one for the senate on Tuesdays and the one for the Cabinet on Wednesdays.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Who in the government attends your Bible studies?\nDrollinger: We have about twelve people attending. Every cabinet member shows up with three Suburbans but you don\u2019t know which one he or she is in. So you can tell who\u2019s coming to Bible study that morning because all their security detail are there before us. Vice President Mike Pence attends, as does Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Ben Carson, Betsy DeVos, Sonny Perdue, Rick Perry, Mike Pompeo.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: And once they\u2019ve all arrived, what happens then? How does the session start?\nDrollinger: Whether it\u2019s the Congress or the Cabinet, we always give them a meal first, breakfast or dinner. The House Bible study meets for dinner. In the Cabinet, the meal has to be smaller because they have very strict limits about how much can be spent for them, under ten dollars a person. A croissant and a coffee, or a spinach quiche, that\u2019s it. Suffice to say, while they\u2019re eating I\u2019m teaching. I occupy their mouths with food so I don\u2019t have to compete. They don\u2019t necessarily realize I\u2019m doing that by the way. I\u2019m usually able to teach for a half hour before I start asking questions about what I\u2019ve taught and getting a discussion going. And then as they ask questions and make comments I\u2019m usually pouring on more passages of scripture to create better clarity, more perspicuity. After an hour, the Study is over. We start and end with prayer, but it\u2019s not a prayer meeting. Prayer is fine, but there are already so many prayer meetings in DC these people could go to.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: What kind of things do the ministers pray for?\nDrollinger: First Timothy 2:1-4 summons us to pray for those in authority. So we\u2019ll pray for their boss. Oftentimes we\u2019ll pray for Trump and Vice-President Pence because who knows what they\u2018re gonna face today. And we get personal prayer requests; someone has a sick father, someone else is grieving for a close relative. Those kind of things.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: In your course you strictly follow the order of the Bible, verse after verse, one book after another. It takes you years to get through a single book. What are you currently working on at the White House?\nDrollinger: We started that cabinet Bible study in March. I just jumped in and caught them up on the Sermon on the Mount which I\u2019d been teaching in the senate and the House for the last two years. This week I was talking about Chapter 7, \u201cdo not judge less ye be judged yourself\u201d. I told them: That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not to be discerning. Jesus is judging judgmentalism. That criticism is particularly directed at the scribes and Pharisees. As an expositor you use one passage to teach other passages in parallel. Here, a passage from proverbs fits in, proverbs 3:3: \u201cBind both kindness and truth around your neck, write them both on the tablet of your heart.\u201d So we just build on that one verse \u201cdo not judge\u201d with a myriad of other passages and then I review it the next week. So we just keep on going over it again and again. I often kid the members the reason I go slow is \u2018cause that\u2019s as fast you can learn. That always gets a laugh. But there\u2019s a lot of truth in it.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Which biblical stories are particularly relevant for politicians?\nDrollinger: I like the analogy of Daniel, Mordecai and Joseph. There\u2019s the question of what do the three of them have in common. They all rose to the number two position under a secular leader, and I see Pence the same way. As a legislator, you can learn a lot from these guys. I\u2019ve written probably 80 Bible studies on the Book of Proverbs. The Proverbs are all written by King Solomon to his son, the future king. That\u2018s the contextual purpose of the book: preparing someone for public service. And so if something is taught in the Proverbs, it is essential to public service, and if it\u2019s not in the Proverbs, it probably isn\u2019t.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: What kind of questions would a US minister ask on this topic?\nDrollinger: Well, first of all they kid me a lot about using big words they don\u2019t know. Then they\u2019ll intentionally use the big word incorrectly just to tease me. Like Sacerdotalism and so on. Rather than trying to learn they\u2019ll just tease me about it. At the end of a session they\u2019ll usually have about two minutes where there\u2019ll go round the room and all use my words incorrectly. Apart from that, we talk a lot about humility, because this place puffs you up. These guys have so many counselors, they even have whole press offices, and everyone keeps telling them to take credit for this and that. To grandstand. But Jesus teaches the exact opposite. How do you work out this tension? Sometimes some members will ask me: Where should I come down on this vote? Because it seems like the scripture says this but then I can reason it with this scriptural principle. So they\u2019re asking, what scriptural principle should have pre-eminence over the other and should really sway my vote as I try to please God?\nWELT AM SONNTAG: What do you wear when teaching?\nDrollinger: We teach all our guys you\u2019ve got to dress a cut above. The speaker should always be a cut above his audience, but not two cuts above. I have to wear a suit, an English wool suit of fine make, tailored, all cotton dress shirt with cufflinks, the White House cufflink, all Italian silk tie, 13 ounce silk with a dimple knot, a white T-shirt underneath my all cotton white dress shirt, Allen Edmonds shoes, custom made leather shoes, \u2018cause I\u2019m a size 17. But that\u2019s what the politicians wear, and if I don\u2019t dress a cut above them, they\u2019ll say this guy doesn\u2019t belong in our club, he\u2019s not on our level. It\u2019s expensive to play that game, but otherwise you\u2019ll shoot yourself in the foot.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: So no liturgical clothing?\nDrollinger: No, I don\u2019t do that because to me that\u2019s arrogant.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Why do politicians need a Bible study group?\nDrollinger: If they don\u2019t know biblical principles then it\u2019s like the Book of Judges which says twice: \u201cEvery man did what was right in his own eyes\u201d. But we believe in the New Testament idea that everyone should bring their thoughts \u201ccaptive to the obedience of Christ\u201d. And how do you go from what\u2019s taught in Judges to what\u2019s taught in the New Testament unless you have a prophetic voice, someone who can teach you week in and week out the rudimentary principles of scripture and how those apply to your life personally? Because if they don\u2019t know them, how can they be obedient to them? Without a preacher, the boat lacks the helm.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: And it\u2019s your belief that God wants you to be this prophetic voice?\nDrollinger: Well I think that sounds kind of arrogant\u2026 But it\u2019s kind of like that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. And I\u2019m the first to pinch myself and say, who am I? I\u2019m just kind of an old beat-up jock. But at the same time \u2013 and I say this in all candor and humility \u2013we have spent years writing an eight page Bible study every week that has not only drilled down deep into the Word of God but then has a custom application to the life of a political leader. So in that sense it doesn\u2019t surprise me that the Lord has elevated us to this position because I don\u2019t know anyone else who\u2019s really done that discipline.\n***\nDrollinger speaks softly, without ever pausing for long; a single, velvety, quiet flow of speech. His wife Danielle listens, sometimes saying \"exactly!\" or \"true, absolutely!\" Every now and then, when her husband is speaking too openly for her taste, she tries to rein him in a bit, but in vain. The relationship between CapMin and the media is complicated. On the one hand, the organization could do with the publicity to enable them to expand, particularly abroad. On the other hand, there is a fear of bad press and reports of the organization\u2019s growing influence. \u201cFake news\u201d, as Drollinger calls it.\nThe participants of the course are most likely glad CapMin is not too public. On the website, the organization promises : \"We protect the privacy of all who attend our Bible studies.\u201d Being devout does not automatically damage the public image of an American politician. But being evangelical?\nThe Office of the Vice-President, the CIA and the Ministries of Justice, Housing, Education, Agriculture and Energy, did not respond when this newspaper asked them to confirm whether their bosses attended Drollinger's Bible courses. CapMin, however, always prints ministers\u2019 names in the margins of its Bible sermons as an endorsement, seemingly without the ministries objecting. Through a spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice, The Washington Post was able to confirm one regular attendee: Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n***\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Do you have direct contact with Donald Trump?\nRalph Drollinger: It\u2019s a pen pal relationship. I started sending him my Bible studies when he was running his campaign and Trump has been writing notes back to me ever since, in a positive sense. He likes loyalty. I supported him from very early on in the campaign and Jeff Sessions would tell you I influenced him to do the same in the Bible study. The Bible contains some criteria for someone who\u2019s going to lead in the state. The primary passages are Romans 13:1-8 and Peter 2:13-14, both reiterate the idea that the institution of state does not bear the sword for nothing. It\u2019s an \u201cavenger of wrath\u201d: It punishes those who do evil and it rewards those who do good. So the major God-given responsibility, the state\u2019s primary calling, is to moralize a fallen world through the use of force. I think the best President is the one who is best going to use government as an adjudicator of wrongdoing. And I always thought that Trump would be the best at that.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Have you met him in person?\nDrollinger: Unfortunately not. But four weeks ago when they had the cabinet retreat at Camp David, Pence told the whole cabinet that for the security of the cabinet members we\u2019re gonna move the Bible study into the White House. Before, we used to meet in one of the cabinet member\u2019s conference rooms. That makes it really hard for Vice President Pence to come to the study because they have to sweep the buildings due to security reasons, but that\u2019s already done in the White House. I think we\u2019ll be in an office right next to the West Wing. So it\u2019ll be easy for Trump to drop in. And I get the sense he will because he\u2019s always said let\u2019s get together when the dust settles.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Trump comes across as arrogant, short-tempered, belligerent. Would you describe him as a good Christian?\nDrollinger: I\u2019d rather not comment on that but I\u2019d like to say this: If there was a businessman\u2019s \u201cManhattan for Christ\u201d ministry and ten guys like me who ran around Manhattan and went up the skyscrapers and held Bible studies with Donald Trumps in their 20s or 30s, then the Donald Trump of today would be a completely different person. His whole exposure to Christianity was through Norman Vincent Peale. Norman Vincent Peale only taught Philippians 4, which was \u201cthe power of positive thinking\u201d. Well, that\u2019s certainly biblical, but there\u2019s a whole boatload of theology in the Bible other than just the power of positive thinking. Trump is of such a sensitive heart; he wants to please God. If he knew more of the Bible from a good Bible teacher it would really change his heart. Hopefully the Lord will give me that opportunity with him. I mean, he reads my Bible studies and writes me positive notes. That\u2019s a good start.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: What kind of notes does he write?\nDrollinger: Just like \u201cgreat Bible study this week!\u201d Recently, he wrote \u201cI love this Bible study Ralph!\u201d. It\u2019s always a Sharpie, all capital letters, except his e s are always lowercase. But that\u2019s how he writes, and he underlines everything. It\u2019s always 25 point bold font. But it\u2019s so his personality, you know. I just love the guy.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Have you ever seen a law or a vote that has made you think, \u201cYes, that\u2019s down to our influence\u201d?\nDrollinger: All the time. About three months ago, in the Cabinet Bible Study, we were on Romans 12. Romans 12,18-21 talks about how vengeance is God\u2019s and you need to be at peace with all men. So there\u2019s no place theologically for personal vindictive behavior even when you\u2019ve been treated unjustly. But now look over at Romans 13:4 where it\u2019s saying God has given us government to basically reward or punish evil-doers. The institution of state \u201cdoes not bear the sword for nothing\u201d. So I\u2019ll ask the cabinet members: Do you think there is a contradiction? How do you relate this to your own lives? And Rick Perry says: \u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is when I induce capital punishment, as the governor, I\u2019m wearing my state hat and there\u2019s every place for that biblically. But in terms of me when I\u2019m not wearing my state hat, I need to be forgiving of that individual that I just put to death?\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it,\u201d and he looks at me and says, \u201cYou know if I would\u2019ve known that when I was governor of Texas that would\u2019ve made my life a whole lot different. The press used to beat me up on that seeming contradiction all the time, and I never had the theology clear in my mind, so I used to feel guilty. But when I see it clearly through the lens of scripture it guides my conscience.\u201d Well that leads for good governance.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Are there similar courses from other religions happening in the White House?\nDrollinger: We don\u2019t have a whole lot of other religions trying to compete with what we\u2019re doing, but I welcome them. We totally take the view in America that there should be an institutional separation of Church and state. I think that\u2019s what the New Testament teaches. If you don\u2019t have such a separation, you\u2019re advocating theocracy. I\u2019m really adverse to American chaplains in the House and the Senate; they should be expunged. Why should the government pay Christian preachers when it doesn\u2019t pay for preachers of other religions? Isn\u2019t that a violation of the First Amendment? Every preacher in Congress should be funded through the non-profit with a board that\u2019s autonomous of the state. It should be a fair playing field for all religions. I wish the same were true in the Middle East.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: You don\u2019t get any money for your course?\nDrollinger: We have a strict policy of never asking for money from anyone who comes to our Bible studies if they are an elected or appointed leader. We raise money from foundations and individuals and churches. We don\u2019t have any real financial needs so I don\u2019t even have to spend a whole lot of time fundraising. Donors see that the efficiency of an investment in CapMin is far superior to almost anything else a Christian businessman can invest in in America. You can build Christian universities which cost millions of dollars in brick and mortar or you can invest in Christian radio stations which cost millions of dollars. Or you invest in CapMin which costs tens of thousands of dollars in comparison to have just as much if not more influence. As for myself, CapMin pays me a fair salary but I usually don\u2019t take my whole salary. I don\u2019t need it. I played in the NBA and my money has been invested well, so I don\u2019t need a whole lot of money from the non-profit.\n***\nWhen Jesus entered his life, Ralph Drollinger was just 18 years old and attending high school in his hometown of La Mesa, a suburb of San Diego, California. At this time he was interested in two things: basketball and cheerleaders.\nAfter a game, he tells me, one of the cheerleaders asked if he wanted to go a Bible meeting she attended. It was a meeting of the evangelical organization \"Youth for Christ\". There, for the first time, he listened attentively to some of the Gospel and was immediately fascinated. At home, in his childhood room, he read through the entire Gospel of Matthew and decided from then on to become a disciple of Jesus.\nAs a talented sportsman, Drollinger could have his choice of university. A total of 200 universities across the country offered him basketball scholarships. He picked the University of California in Los Angeles because of the trainer John Wooden, a kind of Franz Beckenbauer of American college basketball. Alongside his sports training, Drollinger attended Bible school.\nEvangelizing politicians instead of athletes After graduating, Drollinger initially rejected the NBA's offer of a professional career. Instead, he spent four years with a group called Athletes in Action, an activist team who toured around the world and preached the Bible on the sidelines of the basketball court. Subsequently, at the age of 26, Drollinger signed an NBA contract with the Dallas Mavericks, but his career did not last long. After less than a year in the NBA and only six games his professional career was over due to a knee injury. That was in 1981.\nAs he recovered from this disappointment, Drollinger tried to find the next closest thing: He wanted to combine his missionary zeal with sport. He invested money in magazines and television projects which showed athletes talking about their faith. At the same time, he completed his training at the Master's Seminary in California. It wasn\u2019t until later that he got the idea to change his strategy: evangelizing future politicians instead of athletes. In 1997 he and his wife Danielle founded Capitol Ministries in California. Today, 20 years later, the organization is represented in 40 federal states, as well as in 24 other nations. Every year, this increases by a dozen.\nIn his book \" Rebuilding America \" , published in 2012, Drollinger writes: \u201cWhereas a sports ministry movement is certain to have a positive impact on many, helping to generate a movement for Christ amongst governing authorities holds promise to change the direction of a whole country!\u201d\nIn Drollinger's weekly Bible studies, which can be downloaded from his website in English, French, Spanish, and Russian, you can see the direction in which he wants to take America. In the studies he gives religious answers to all sorts of political questions. In reference to dealing with illegal immigrants, for example, he writes : \u201cSimilar to a parent who incorrectly feels guilty for spanking a rebellious child because his conscience is not sufficiently informed by Scripture, the conscience of the lawmaker too, should be informed by God\u2019s Word on this subject. And God\u2019s Word says He frowns on illegal immigrants \u2014 just like He says He frowns on children ruling the roost!\u201d\n\u201ePacifism has no biblical justification\u201c\nIn response to the debate about America\u2019s welfare benefits, he writes : \u201cAt the risk of sounding unloving, a father in the Institution of Marriage, a family in the Institution of the Family, nor a government in the Institution of Government should bear or be led to think they bear the responsibility to meet the needs of the individual who lives in an undisciplined manner, who does no work at all, who is not willing to work or be willing to work hard enough. Proverbs 10:4 echoes this principle: Poor is he who works with a negligent hand, But the hand of the diligent makes rich.\u201d\nOn the question of the death penalty, he states : \u201cJesus Himself validates capital punishment in the New Testament era when He states in Matthew 5:38: You have heard that it was said, \u2018An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019\u201d\nAnd on military intervention, he writes : \u201cIn summary, pacifism has no biblical justification. It amounts only to wishful thinking in an evil, fallen world\u2026 When America is strong, and the threat of her intervening is ever-present the world is a much safer place. And the opposite is now increasingly apparent: When American intervention is of a lesser possibility, unrest and evil aggression rise.\u201d\n***\nWELT AM SONNTAG: You make political arguments based on your interpretation of the Bible. What comes first: Your interpretation or the political argument you want to make?\nRalph Drollinger: Well, that would be the difference between eisogesis and exegesis. Do I read my beliefs into the text, or do I try to find out what\u2019s already in it? I think I do the latter. By the way, I never tell politicians what they should do. That\u2019s what lobbyists do. I\u2019m not a lobbyist. I don\u2019t say: Putin is a jerk because of what he did in the Ukraine. But I\u2019ll give them a biblical principle that makes it pretty easy for them to make the connection in their own minds without me saying Putin\u2019s name.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: But what is the difference between you and a lobbyist? You\u2019re pointing in a certain direction whether you say Putin\u2019s name or not.\nDrollinger: It\u2019s a fine line. I think I\u2019m stepping over the line if I tell them how to vote. I lead them up to water and make it pretty obvious which pool to drink from. But in the end, it\u2019s their own call.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Why is it so important to you to distinguish yourself from a lobbyist?\nDrollinger: Number one: You get into problems with America\u2019s legal system when you do that. We have this thing called the Johnson Amendment that limits NGO\u2019s when it comes to lobbying. Besides, I want to be seen as bipartisan. I\u2019m never going to pound people over the head for being a Democrat. So I\u2019ve got Democrats in my study but the minute they think I\u2019m just here to support Republican positions then all of a sudden I lose my credibility with half the people, or at least they think my predisposition is against them. And there\u2019s another difference: Lobbyists focus on a particular topic, on a particular vote. Our goal is to change the hearts of the people. We\u2019re heart driven rather than policy driven. I think if we were 100 per cent successful at that then there would be very little need for Christian lobbyists. You don\u2019t have to tell Mike Pence how to vote because his heart is already captive to the obedience of Christ.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Your organization wants to come to Germany next. Why are you only attempting this now? Is Germany particularly difficult?\nDrollinger: We want to have a full-time trained Bible leader in every federal capital of the world, and we\u2019re coming to Berlin soon. I mean, after all I\u2019m a Kraut myself, my name is German, how could I deny my heritage\u2026 But we used to begin with the countries where there is the lowest hanging fruit. We\u2019re doing very well in Romania at the moment, for example, since there are so many Christian legislators. I do think Germany is going to be tougher. I hear it\u2019s pretty secular. But we\u2019re open to what God gives us there.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: How far along are your plans?\nDrollinger: Our Western European director is already charged with finding what we call an insider and an outsider for Berlin. The insider would be some politician mature in Christ who he could bring us into the parliament and tell some of his colleagues about our study. The outsider would be a really good, respected Bible teacher. He should be on the same socio-economic education level as the parliamentarians, and he should have enough bandwidth to be full time in the parliament, to build relationships and impart the word of God. It\u2019s important that he really teaches the whole counsel of God. Just like all our preachers, he is just a servant, carrying the meal out from the kitchen and whether or not the diners eat it is up to them. We just want a faithful guy who won\u2019t rearrange the meal on the way out from the kitchen but will serve it the way the chef wanted it to be.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Why \u201che\u201d? Has it got to be a man?\nDrollinger: The Bible says that men need to be taught by men. It doesn\u2019t ever say that women should be teaching men.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: What about female members of government?\nDrollinger: Well they can have a good female Bible teacher too, we\u2019d love that. Of course women can teach, but only women, or males under a certain age. But female legislators can also sit in on a male Bible study. I have a lot of female legislators that sit in on my ministry. But if I need to follow up with, say, Betsy DeVos, it\u2019s better that my wife Danielle is with me or that she follows up with Betsy DeVos. I would not write Betsy DeVos emails about her issues and whatever. It\u2019s just safer in terms of the integrity of the ministry and the optics of the ministry that Danielle handles the female workload rather than me. Like I\u2019ll never go into an office, shut the door with a female member and talk about her marital issues, you know. That\u2019s just asking for trouble.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: And what does it say about men and women in the Bible?\nDrollinger: There\u2019s a biblical idea of the criteria for an overseer in the Church given in first Timothy 3 and Titus 1. And they\u2019re all male pronouns, and it says of the person he must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity, and it also says he must be a one woman man. It\u2019s hard to get around the fact God seems to be describing male leadership here. I may not have set it up the same way, but He did, and I just want to be true to that. That\u2019s what it means to be a servant who just wants to carry the meal out of the kitchen correctly and not alter the meal.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: But you yourself are married to your second wife. You got divorced from your first.\nDrollinger: The Bible says he must be the husband of one wife, and in the Greek it reads \u201ca one woman man\u201d. So I think guys can be divorced and remarried as long as they\u2019re not married to two women. By the way, I tried to do everything I could to save my first marriage, but she went into the lesbian lifestyle, and that was 20 years ago.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: In your interpretations you ignore the basic findings of historical-critical research as to the origins of individual biblical books or their authority. The Proverbs of Solomon, for example, that you mentioned, don\u2019t appear in one complete book from the father to his son, but in fact are the result of a number of different Quote: s. But you stick to the original attributions: Moses wrote the five books of Moses, St. Peter wrote St. Peter\u2019s Epistles and so on. Why do you do that?\nDrollinger: Those theories you mention killed a lot of evangelical churches in America and are one of the main confluences of theological liberalism. But they have been postulated decades ago, some of them are even from the 19 th century. Today, there\u2019s so much more evidence that plays in favor of the infallibility and inerrancy of the Bible. Archeological findings for instance. How often do I hear: \u201cYou can\u2019t find this and that in the archeological records to support what the Bible says.\u201d Well now there\u2019s so much more biblical archeological discovery that it really supports the infallibility of the Word of God. You would be really amazed.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: The Bible appeared over the course of centuries, in very different contexts, written by very different people. As a result there are contradictions. How do you deal with these contradictions?\nDrollinger: That\u2019s easy. One of the principles of my hermeneutics says: If God is infallible and perfect in nature, and if all scripture is actually the breath of God put on paper, then it would follow that the Bible would hold his attributes of perfection and infallibility. So you have to presume in interpreting the Bible that it doesn\u2019t contradict itself; you give the benefit of doubt to the author. So if you come across a gray area of scripture, you have to interpret it alongside the more definitive passages of scripture in order to synthesize it.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Why don\u2019t you just present the contradictions? Why don\u2019t you just say \u201cOkay, according to the Gospel of Mark Jesus was crucified on the third hour of the day, so in the morning, and according to the Gospel of John he was crucified on the sixth hour, so midday, but at the actual theological core of the crucifixion itself this discrepancy is insignificant\u201d?\nDrollinger: These are seeming incongruities. But if you look outside of the box you can iron them out. There are books written on those tough passages. One Gospel writer might say Jesus was crucified at noon but what he means in the original Greek is that it happened when the sun was up. Then another one might be more definitive saying it was 9am. Those things can all be combed out by just looking outside the box.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: You often refer to the original text of the Bible. How much Hebrew and Greek do you know?\nDrollinger: Well, not a whole lot. I wouldn\u2019t really be able to, let\u2019s say, read the whole Old Testament in Hebrew. I rely a lot on commentaries because today there are just so many excellent commentaries of all books in the Bible. There\u2019s actually commentaries on commentaries. And these scholars have maybe spent their whole life studying one book of the Bible. So if you read that person you can get a distillation that you couldn\u2019t get from thousands of hours of personal study. And so I just learned to rely on the best commentators. My Greek is a little better, by the way. I really like to read the Apostle Paul. Some guys in our Senate study will say: \u201cRalph\u2019s in love with the Apostle Paul.\u201d But that\u2019s usually James Lankford because his name is James \u2013 he likes the book of James\u2026\nWELT AM SONNTAG: On your website it says of you, \u201cHe teaches the Bible without compromise or apology, and without leaving out Scripture that may offend people.\u201d Do you think every verse of the Bible is equally important? Is the Sermon on the Mount equally significant in your eyes as some list in the Book of Numbers?\nDrollinger: First of all: all scripture is inspired by God and all scripture can be taught. So I believe a preacher has to teach the whole counsel of God and can\u2019t just knife out some things because they may offend. Having said that, I only have a limited time with these guys. Instead of talking about the Book of Numbers for three years, I\u2019d rather spend my time on the Sermon of the Mount because I think that\u2019s what they need the most at the moment. A pastor always has to understand the spot where it\u2019s really itching, and scratch that.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Are there passages of the Bible that you still don\u2019t understand?\nDrollinger: Of course!\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Which ones for example?\nDrollinger: You know, I go so slow and teach so little of the New Testament that I\u2019m usually just dealing with more basic theological understanding. I can\u2019t go into a lot of really difficult passages, even if it would be more satisfying to me intellectually. These guys have so much more to learn first. These people come here with a thimbleful of biblical knowledge! When we ask the members to open a certain biblical book, many of them don\u2019t have the slightest idea where in the Bible it might be located. So we always tell them the page number so that no one is embarrassed. I inherit the results of a dumbed-down church in America, with all those kindergarten Bible scholars. I hope to reverse that.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: So what do the kindergarten Bible scholars preach?\nDrollinger: Cotton candy. A lot of fluff that suits the liberal zeitgeist. Self-help messages like self-esteem, motivation, self-improvement. Or, like I said, the power of positive thinking. If you go to church every week and you are taught to think positively, well, that\u2019s great if you\u2019re a real-estate developer: \u201cI just lost a deal last week, I need Him to really cheer me up for next week.\u201d But there\u2019s a whole lot more to the Scripture.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Are you ever scared of interpreting the Bible incorrectly?\nDrollinger: I am steeped in such a strong view of inerrancy that I really believe that to hold to a presupposition other than inerrancy would make me much more insecure. Just because there\u2019s so many passages of scripture that nail inerrancy. For example, disbanding the six days of creation would make me a whole lot more insecure because I couldn\u2019t just do away the passages where Jesus Quote: s the creation account in the New Testament. Rather than being the interpretive power over the book, I let the book be the interpretive power over me. That\u2019s the difference: Some act like the judge of Scripture, some are willing to be judged by it. One breeds pride and the other breeds humility.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: Do you sometimes sin?\nDrollinger: We\u2019re all sinners in need of Christ\u2019s salvation. I am, too, absolutely. I don\u2019t think that any of us quit sinning until the day of Glorification. The closer you get to God, the further you really are from him, the more you see your own sinful nature, outwardly or inwardly.\nWELT AM SONNTAG: What would be a typical sin for you?\nDrollinger: I can be very judgmental, for example when I talk to my wife about people. I was talking to couples yesterday in the cabinet study \u2013 we have a lot of couples there \u2013 saying that we as couples have to be really careful in our conversations with our mate that we\u2019re not privately too critical of other people. Even if that\u2019s never revealed, we form those habits in privacy.\n***\n\"Are you finally done?\" Drollinger jokes wearily. He has taken his time; we\u2019ve been talking for two and a half hours. Even when his wife had to leave, he patiently stayed sitting there, answering all my questions without any trace of restlessness. \u201cYou came all the way from Germany,\u201d he says again and again. At the end Drollinger stands up to his full height. Instead of making the short walk from the first floor down to the lobby, he chooses to take the elevator. He offers his hand to say goodbye, but does not come outside into the warm autumn afternoon.\nRalph Drollinger stays in the club a while longer.\nTranslated from German by Myfanwy Craigie.",

Schlie\u00dflich gelang ihm das auf Schlusskursbasis bereits fast 50 Mal in diesem Jahr. Au\u00dferdem hat der US-Leitindex mittlerweile die l\u00e4ngste Strecke aller Zeiten hinter sich, in der er keinen einzigen Handelstag ohne eine signifikante Korrektur von mindestens drei Prozent hingelegt hat. \nDas sind mehr als 241 Handelstage \u2013 bisher. Die Volatilit\u00e4t ist zudem eingeschlafen, bet\u00e4ubt von Notenbankgeld. Wie \u00fcblich haben die Analysten vor dem Start der Quartalssaison ihre Gewinnsch\u00e4tzungen jedoch reduziert. Laut der Researchfirma FactSet liegt das erwartete Gewinnwachstum f\u00fcr das dritte Quartal bei lediglich 2,8 Prozent, womit sich der Wert gegen\u00fcber dem zweiten Quartal stark abschw\u00e4chen w\u00fcrde. Apple im Fokus \nDas belastet nat\u00fcrlich auch die Schwergewichte in den Indizes und hier steht Apple als weltgr\u00f6\u00dftes Unternehmen besonders im Fokus. Die j\u00fcngsten Absatzzahlen zum neuen iPhone 8 k\u00f6nnten entt\u00e4uschen, weil vor allem Zulieferer sich j\u00fcngst beim Aufbau von L\u00e4gern zur\u00fcckgehalten haben. Nach diesen Aussagen gab die Aktien etwas nach, hat sich aber zuletzt stabilisiert, was f\u00fcr Seitw\u00e4rtspapiere von Vorteil ist. Anzeige \n\u201eIn Seitw\u00e4rtstrends spielen Discount-Zertifikate ihre St\u00e4rke aus\u201c, erkl\u00e4rt Dominik Auricht, Zertifikateexperte bei HypoVereinsbank onemarkets. \u201eSollte sich die Aktie nach der Ver\u00f6ffentlichung der Quartalsergebnisse Anfang November weiter beruhigen und die implizite Volatilit\u00e4t sinken, k\u00f6nnte der Wert von Discount-Zertifikaten zulegen\u201c, erg\u00e4nzt Auricht. \nHiervon profitieren Anleger, die sich bereits in den Papieren engagiert haben. Gut bewertet ist das Papier mit der WKN CY5U1Z, dass bis zum M\u00e4rz 2018 l\u00e4uft und eine maximale Renditechance von 15.3 Prozent j\u00e4hrlich bietet, wenn die Aktie nur leicht auf 160 US-Dollar steigt. Mutige Anleger greifen dagegen zum Call-Optionsschein, etwa das Papier mit der WKN CW4XVC, Laufzeit bis Juni 2018. Der Hebel ist mit 5 moderat. \nBei der Zahlenvorlage am 2. November d\u00fcrfte der Ausblick entscheidend sein, ob die Aktie weiter in Richtung Rekordhoch tendieren k\u00f6nnte. F\u00fcr das vergangene Quartal sagen Analysten einen Umsatzanstieg von neun Prozent auf 50,9 Milliarden Dollar vorher. Der Gewinn je Aktie soll auf 1,87 Dollar nach oben schie\u00dfen. Anzeige \nDagegen haben Analysten f\u00fcr das laufende Quartal die Messlatte hoch geh\u00e4ngt und prognostizieren ein Umsatzplus von zehn Prozent. Wie hoch die Erwartungen der Investoren sind, zeigt der B\u00f6rsenwert von herben 828,9 Milliarden Dollar eindrucksvoll, womit Apple mit Abstand die weltweite Nummer eins ist. Vor dem Hintergrund sollte der Ausblick die Investoren besser nicht entt\u00e4uschen. Energie und Tech sind die Favoriten \nDer gr\u00f6\u00dfte Belastungsfaktor k\u00f6nnte aber bei den Versicherern liegen, weil deren Sch\u00e4tzungen nach den Hurrikans eingebrochen sind. Bereinigt um den Sektor, w\u00fcrden die Profite der S&P 500-Firmen laut FactSet um 4,9 Prozent steigen. \nDas gr\u00f6\u00dfte Gewinnplus werde mit weitem Vorsprung der Energiesektor , sprich die \u00d6l- und Gasfirmen und ihre Zulieferer, verbuchen, was vor allem an dem schwachen Vergleichswerten des Vorjahres liegt. Das zweitst\u00e4rkste Gewinnwachstum sollen die IT-Firmen liefern, angetrieben von den Halbleiterfirmen und ihren Zulieferern. \nDie Chipfirma Micron Technology, deren Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr im August endete, hat Investoren mit den Ergebnissen begeistert, woraufhin die Aktie auf ein 16-Jahres-Hoch gestiegen ist. Das k\u00f6nnte vielleicht doch ein gutes Omen f\u00fcr die Apple-Aktie sein. \nDer Autor ist Finanzjournalist und BILANZ-Kolumnist. \u00a9 WeltN24 GmbH. Alle Rechte vorbehalten.
