I hold her and talk to her until she\u2019s rubbing her eyes and I rock her to sleep. We do the same song and dance for much of the morning. My son was going to school until 12:30 but I actually upped his hours to 2:30pm in the hopes of getting her more on track. Nope.\n2:10pm: This is wear the day gets wonky because if it\u2019s nice out, I try to get my son outside playing and I babywear her. She\u2019ll catnap in her Tula often. This is likely my problem? It\u2019s just so hard because I live in a 3rd floor apartment so I feel guilty keeping him all cooped up... especially after a long day at school.\nAlways home by 5:30 for dinner. How she napped on any given day is anyone\u2019s guess but I try to stretch her out. 6pm her bath, 6:15 her brothers bath. She hangs out in a bouncy while he plays and I play some special bedtime songs on my phone. Same songs every night.\nWhen the playlist is done, my son knows to get out of the bath. I brush his teeth, pajamas. She watches.\nMy husband comes home at his point. We both read a book... sometimes my daughter is so very very tired she needs to leave early.\nShe gets a sleep sack, white noise. a lovey. Nurses. I wake her up and she cries. I put her down.\nScreams bloody murder for one minute. I pick her up. Screams bloody murder for 3 minutes. I pick her up and soothe her\nCries herself to sleep always before the 5 minute mark. Sometimes 1 minute, sometimes 4. Varies.\nI cry a bit too, but at least our night\u2019s are ok.

There will be crying, but it's probably less than you think and it's the fastest way.\nSleepy signs are not reliable at this age anymore, so go with wake times, not sleepy signs, to determine naps and bedtime. You're looking for wake times in the 1.75-2 hour range right now, and 3-4 naps. If she naps a decent amount, I would do 3 naps and something like 1.75/2/2/1.75-2 for wake times. Early bedtime is fine if that's where the wake times put you.\nYou also want to switch to putting her down wide awake at bedtime, not drowsy at all. Switch the last feeding to the beginning of the bedtime routine and limit any rocking so she's going down wide awake.\nUse a cut-off for feedings. I would do 1 single feeding, at least 7-8 hours into her night. Adding back a feeding is a bad idea, because she's just shifting calories to the night, which is unnecessary and interferes with her rest. For wake-ups outside the cutoff, the absolute fastest way to go is CIO: 1 check after 10 minutes, and then leave her until she falls asleep. The intensity of her cry has nothing to do with whether this will work. It's normal for her to be angry because you're switching things up on her.
