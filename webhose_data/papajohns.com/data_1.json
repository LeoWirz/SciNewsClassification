(NASDAQ: PZZA)today announced financial results for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2017 Third quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.60 in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.3% System-wide third quarter comparable sales increases of 1.0% for North America and 5.3% for International 2017 North America comp sales outlook revised to positive up to 1.5% from the prior range of 2.0% to 4.0%; revised diluted earnings per share growth to 3% to 7% from a previous range of 8% to 12%, including the 53 rd week but excluding the impact of new equity based compensation accounting standard \n\"Our global operators delivered another quarter of positive comp sales, with International leading the way, posting the 30 th consecutive quarter of International positive comps,\" said Papa John's founder, chairman and CEO, John Schnatter . \"We will continue to drive the long-term growth of the Papa John's brand by investing in our better quality product and technology platforms.\" \nOperating Highlights \n(In thousands except per share amounts) % \nAll operating highlights are compared to the same period of the prior year, unless otherwise noted. \nConsolidated revenues increased , or 2.2%, for the third quarter of 2017 and increased $41.8 million , or 3.3%, for the nine months ended September 24, 2017 . These increases were primarily due to increased North America commissary sales due to higher volumes. The nine months ended September 24, 2017 commissary sales from commodity price increases. North America franchise revenues also increased primarily due to the impact of refranchising 42 Domestic company-owned restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2016; this increase was more than offset by a related decrease in Domestic company-owned restaurant sales. The increased revenues from International were somewhat offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates was approximately $300,000 and $5.9 million for the three and nine month periods, respectively, which was primarily attributable to our operations in the United Kingdom \nConsolidated operating income increased $132,000 , or 0.4%, for the third quarter of 2017. Operating income as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased 0.1% to 7.8% for the third quarter. Significant changes in the operating income percentage are as follows: Domestic company-owned restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant sales, decreased 1.2% primarily due to higher delivery costs, including higher non-owned auto insurance costs. North America commissary and other margin, as a percentage of related revenues, decreased 1.5% due primarily to higher operating and start-up costs related to our new commissary in Georgia that opened in the third quarter of 2017. Offsetting these decreases, the International margin, as a percentage of international revenues, increased 2.0% due to higher revenues on higher comps and increased units. For the three month period, the United Kingdom (\"UK\") margin also increased due to the 2016 results including a non-recurring expense of approximately $800,000 UK head lease arrangements on a straight line basis. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, decreased 1.0% primarily due to lower management incentive costs and the benefit of higher revenues. \nOn higher revenues, consolidated operating income increased $1.3 million , or 1.2%, for the nine months ended September 24, 2017 . Operating income as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased 0.2% to 8.7% for the nine month period. This decrease was primarily attributable to the same reasons noted for the three month period. \nThe effective income tax rates were 26.8% and 28.4% for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2017 , respectively, representing decreases of 1.6% and 2.5% from the prior year comparable periods. For the quarter, this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in required state and local income tax reserves. 2017 also includes the favorable impact of adopting new guidance for accounting for share-based compensation. This guidance requires excess tax benefits recognized on stock based awards to be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense rather than stockholders' equity. The impact of this adoption decreased our effective tax rates by 0.5% and 1.8% for the three and nine month periods, respectively. \nDiluted earnings per share increased 5.3% to $0.60 for the third quarter of 2017 and increased 8.6% to $2.02 for the nine months ended September 24, 2017 . These increases were primarily due to an increase in net income attributable to common shareholders and a decrease in shares outstanding from share repurchases. Diluted earnings per share for the nine month period was also favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 due to the adoption of the new guidance for accounting for share-based compensation; the impact for the three month period was not significant. Excluding the impact of this adoption, diluted earnings per share would have increased 5.9% for the nine month period. \nGlobal Restaurant Global restaurant sales growth (a) 4.4% Global restaurant sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency (a) 5.0% Includes both company-owned and franchised restaurant sales. (b) Represents the change in year-over-year sales for the same base of restaurants for the same fiscal periods. Comparable sales results for restaurants operating outside of the United States are reported on a constant dollar basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. \nWe believe global restaurant and comparable sales growth information, as defined in the table above, is useful in analyzing our results since our franchisees pay royalties that are based on a percentage of franchise sales. Franchise sales generate commissary revenue in the United States and in certain international markets. Global restaurant and comparable sales growth information is also useful in analyzing industry trends and the strength of our brand. Management believes the presentation of global restaurant sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency provides investors with useful information regarding underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign currency exchange. Franchise restaurant sales are not included in company revenues. \nFree Cash Flow \nThe company's free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, was as follows for the first nine months of 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): Net cash provided by operating activities (a) $ Purchases of property and equipment (b) was primarily due to changes in working capital amounts, partially offset by higher net income. (b) was primarily due to construction costs for our new domestic commissary in Georgia . \nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities (from the consolidated statements of cash flows) less the amounts spent on the purchase of property and equipment. We view free cash flow as an important liquidity measure because it is one factor that management uses in determining the amount of cash available for investment; however, it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our measure of free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the company's liquidity than the company's GAAP measures. \nSee the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for additional information concerning our operating results and cash flow for the nine months ended September 24, 2017 \nAt September 24, 2017 , there were 5,101 Papa John's restaurants operating in all 50 states and in 43 international countries and territories, as follows: % \nThe 2017 International franchise closures include 33 India closures in the third quarter and 66 India closures for the nine months ended. As of the end of the third quarter, the India market was closed. There was no significant impact on our 2017 operating results. \nThe company has added 130 net worldwide units over the trailing four quarters. Our development pipeline as of September 24, 2017 includes over 1,000 restaurants (over 200 units in North America and 800 units internationally), the majority of which are scheduled to open over the next six years. \nShare Repurchase Activity \nThe following table reflects our share repurchases for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2017 29,722 \nThere were 36.6 million and 37.0 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2017 , respectively, representing decreases of 2.1% and 1.8% over the prior year comparable periods. Approximately 35.5 million actual shares of the company's common stock were outstanding as of September 24, 2017 of the Company's share repurchase authorization was remaining as of October 24, 2017 . \nThe Company expects to repurchase the remaining authorization by early to mid-2019. The timing and volume of share repurchases may be executed at the discretion of management on an opportunistic basis, or pursuant to trading plans or other arrangements. Any share repurchase under this program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, and may depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors. The Company expects to implement an accelerated share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2017 for a portion of the share repurchase authorization. Repurchases under the Company's share repurchase program may be commenced or suspended from time to time at the Company's discretion without prior notice. \nCash Dividend \nWe paid a cash dividend of approximately $8.2 million per common share) during the third quarter of 2017. Subsequent to the third quarter, on October 27, 2017 , our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.225 based on the current number of shares outstanding).
