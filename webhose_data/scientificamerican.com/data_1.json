Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne will share the prize for their work on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) , which in 2016 announced it had detected ripples in spacetime for the first time . \n\u201cThis year\u2019s prize is about a discovery that shook the world,\u201d G\u00f6ran Hansson, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said this morning at the Nobel Prize press conference announcing the award. He was speaking both figuratively and literally about a scientific achievement that has garnered headlines worldwide, originating in cosmic cataclysms whose repercussions we feel on Earth billions of light-years from where they started. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really wonderful,\u201d Weiss said this morning by phone at the Nobel Prize press conference. \u201cI view this more as a thing that recognizes the work of about 1,000 people.\u201d LIGO involves scientists from about 90 institutions on five continents. The experiment has now reported four separate observations of gravitational waves. The latest, announced less than a week ago, was made jointly with LIGO\u2019s European counterpart, the Virgo experiment. \u201cThinking about this, trying to make a detection in the early days, sometimes trying and failing,\u201d Weiss recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very exciting that it worked out in the end.\u201d \nGravitational waves, first predicted more than 100 years ago by Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, are vibrations in the fabric of the universe created when extremely massive objects bend spacetime around them. The signals LIGO has seen so far have each come from collisions between two black holes\u2014cosmic fender benders whose violence is beyond imagination. \n\u201cThis is a truly remarkable achievement which crowns almost 50 years of experimental efforts,\u201d said Nils M\u00e5rtensson, chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics. Half of the 9 million Swedish krona ($1.1 million) prize goes to Weiss, a physicist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who spearheaded the effort to design and build LIGO in its earliest days. Thorne, a physicist at California Institute of Technology, is a co-founder of the experiment who led the theoretical work to predict what signals from black hole collisions would look like. Barish, also a physicist at Caltech, is responsible for helping the experiment achieve the extreme precision required to detect gravitational waves. \n\u201cToday is a special day for our whole community,\u201d says Georgia Institute of Technology physicist Laura Cadonati, deputy spokesperson for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. \u201cHundreds of scientists across the world were following the Nobel feed and messages were flying in e-mail and social media. Many of us were a little tearful, and I suspect celebrations will be held across the world today, for Rai, Kip and Barry but also for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, our friends and colleagues in VIRGO, and the future of gravitational wave astrophysics. It is a happy day indeed.\u201d \nLIGO is made of two laser interferometer detectors\u2014one in Washington State and the other in Louisiana, to observe the distortions in space created when a gravitational wave comes along. Shaped like giant L's, the detectors use mirrors to bounce laser light back and forth along their perpendicular four-kilometer-long legs. Incredibly precise atomic clocks detect differences in the amount of time it takes the light to traverse the legs. If a wave has passed through, expanding and contracting Earth around it, the legs will no longer be exactly equal length, and one of the laser beams will arrive a fraction of a second later than the other. \nThe experiment began in the 1960s but took decades to achieve the sensitivity it needed to measure the tiny time lag the laser beams display due to gravitational waves. LIGO scientists made the first confirmed signal in September 2015 and announced the finding the following February. Plans for similar detectors are in the works now in Japan, India and elsewhere. \n\u201cThis award is important, as it helps mark the beginning of a new era in physics and astronomy, an era in which we have a new tool to probe the far reaches of the cosmos\u2014using gravitational waves,\u201d says Robert Caldwell, a professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College. \u201cIn fact, there is a 'dark world' out there of black holes and other exotic objects, which we can access only through gravitational waves. This is truly exciting\u2014like gaining a new sense.\u201d ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S) Clara Moskowitz Clara Moskowitz is Scientific American 's senior editor covering space and physics.

Abazajian on October 3, 2017 Share on Facebook Credit: Cimmerian Getty Images Advertisement \nWith the rise of fascism in Germany, Albert Einstein wrote to his colleague Max von Laue, who had encouraged him to not speak out: \u201cI do not share your view that the scientist should observe silence in political matters, i.e. human affairs in the broadest sense.\u201d \nI am a Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine. I am the Director of the Center for Cosmology , and involved in the Cosmic Microwave Background Stage IV experiment. I am also following up on a signal for dark matter detected with methods my colleagues and I developed when I was a graduate student. \nI am also running for City Council here in Irvine. \nSomeone recently asked \u201cwith everything else going on, why would you do that?\u201d The answer is simple: because there is a need. There has traditionally been strong pressure for scientists to stay out of politics. Many people think that getting involved in politics and policy will make scientists lose their credibility. In fact, the opposite is true. Peer-reviewed studies find scientists maintain their credibility in policy advocacy. In short, scientists are appropriately viewed as bringing science into policy, as opposed to bringing politics into the science. \nScientists are much more involved in political action now than they were a year ago: the November election was a paradigm shift for the scientific world. Americans put into office a president who was openly hostile to scientists and the scientific method. Climate scientists, for example, almost unanimously warn us that our planet is headed over a cliff if we don\u2019t curb carbon emissions; denialism of climate change is about as scientifically fring e as flat-eartherism. But Donald Trump has threatened to pull us out of the international Paris Agreement, and his EPA chief intends to trash the Obama Clean Power Plan. And it isn\u2019t just climate: we are witnessing a near-universal dismissal of expertise of almost all sorts. This is captured well in a post-election cartoon that shows an airline passenger saying, \u201cThese smug pilots have lost touch with regular passengers like us. Who thinks I should fly the plane?\u201d \nThis disdain for expertise goes beyond just science and the environment. A President who dismisses the analyses of the intelligence community is inviting a new level of national instability, while his contempt for the diplomats and international-relations experts at the State Department jeopardizes global security and amplifies nuclear risks. \nThese have increased existential threats have prompted the physicist-led Bulletin of Atomic Scientists to move the Doomsday Clock closer to \u201cmidnight\u201d than it has been since 1953, when the first thermonuclear devices were tested by the U.S. and Soviet Union. But the administration is focused instead on spending huge amounts of money for a border wall that security experts agree will not make us safer. \nThis rejection of the of science naturally leads to rejection of funding. The Presidential Budget Request for 2018 proposed draconian cuts to federal support of the sciences. This is despite overwhelming evidence that federal support of the sciences drives economic progress and improvements in people\u2019s lives. Even before the information-technology revolution, about 85 percent of the growth in U.S. income per capita could be attributed to technological innovation. \nIt is now shockingly clear to scientists and many others that there is a strong need for elected leadership that properly embodies, acknowledges, and retains expertise, particularly with the scientific and technological challenges we face. It is clear that there is a need for competence at all levels of government, and that scientists and engineers can provide it. In fact, both Angela Merkel and Margaret Thatcher started out as chemists. The group 314 Action , founded by chemist Shaughnessy Naughton, matches scientists, engineers, medical and technology experts with the political experts who can help them run viable campaigns\u2014and to date, more than 6,000 people with STEM backgrounds have approached the organization for advice on running for offices from school board to Senate. \nMy own determination to run for city council was inspired by growth that has recently begun spiraling out of control here in Irvine. After being incorporated as a city in 1971, Irvine grew in a measured way until the 1990\u2019s, adding about 5,000 residents per year. Now that pace has nearly doubled. Traffic congestion is becoming worse, and housing costs are shooting up. One reason is that most private property, outside of single family homes, is owned by a private entity, the Irvine Company. Recently, its CEO attempted to attract Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, even though Amazon insists that its new project have access to mass transit\u2014and so far, Irvine is sticking with automobiles. \nThe City of Irvine has a proud history of being a leader on environmental protections. It was the first in America with a comprehensive plan to ban chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) after Nobel prizewinning UC Irvine chemist Sherwood Rowland showed that the chemicals were depleting the planet\u2019s protective ozone layer. Nowadays, with the threat of climate change looming, municipalities can take local action to curb carbon. These include community choice aggregation energy and a commitment to mass transit, which produces far fewer emissions than cars do. \nBut now\u2014shockingly to me\u2014 the majority of Council members are climate change deniers who resist any attempt to push Irvine in the direction of climate neutrality. Given that I believe policy must be based on real evidence and informed by actual expertise, the question of why I\u2019m running for office answers itself. And a growing number of scientists and other STEM professionals evidently agree. \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Barish and Kip S. Thorne , all of them members of the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration. And the academy citation runs \"for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves .\" \nG\u00f6ran Hansson, secretary general of the academy, at 5:52 this morning Eastern time. \n\u201cRainer Weiss was born in 1932 in Berlin in Germany. He received his PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, and he is still affiliated with the M.I.T. as professor of physics. Dr. Weiss is since (sic) many years a U.S. citizen. Barry Barish was born in 1936 in Nebraska in the United States. He\u2019s a professor of physics at Caltech, the California Institute of Technology. And finally, Kip Thorne was born in 1940 in Utah, in the U.S., and he\u2019s currently professor of theoretical physics at Caltech. \n\u201cAnd as I mentioned, all three Nobel laureates are members of the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, a large team of more than a thousand scientists who built and ran the detector that was used to discover gravitational waves. And with that, I\u2019ll give the word to the chairman of the Nobel committee, Nils M\u00e5rtensson.\u201d \n\u201cOn the 14th of September, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, LIGO, succeeded for the first time to directly observe gravitational waves. These waves were predicted by Einstein a hundred years ago, but until now they have escaped direct detection. This is a truly remarkable achievement, which crowns almost 50 years of experimental efforts by hundreds of scientists and engineers. And today the LIGO collaboration includes a thousand members from 90 institutions on five continents\u2026we now witness the dawn of a new field: gravitational wave astronomy. This will teach us about the most violent processes in the universe and it will lead to new insights into the nature of extreme gravity.\u201d \nFor an in-depth listen about the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, look for the Scientific American Science Talk podcast later today. \n\u2014Steve Mirsky", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "technol", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "barry c. barish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainer weiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kip s. thorne", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "inc.all rights reserved", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ligo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "springer nature", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:35:28.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06ecc2b739b2d6951b8780ab0a26e83defc2bffa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnDvEeWcJqjNB.zGFnvVnm5k6BJUnfO1QWf5Yoc7AsD85c7pQSZwtn6TDDC3j6H2Pkw--", "site_full": "www.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "http://rss.sciam.com/ScientificAmerican-Global\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Scientific American Content: Global", "title": "Why Do Smart People Do Foolish Things?", "title_full": "Why Do Smart People Do Foolish Things?", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/09D60405-F6C7-4D65-81F94C5EF743C53A_agenda.jpg?w=600&amp;h=335", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06ecc2b739b2d6951b8780ab0a26e83defc2bffa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnDvEeWcJqjNB.zGFnvVnm5k6BJUnfO1QWf5Yoc7AsD85c7pQSZwtn6TDDC3j6H2Pkw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Heather A.

Intelligence is not the same as critical thinking and the difference matters By Heather A. Butler on October 3, 2017 Share on Facebook Credit: francescoch Getty Images Advertisement \nWe all probably know someone who is intelligent, but does surprisingly stupid things. My family delights in pointing out times when I (a professor) make really dumb mistakes. What does it mean to be smart or intelligent ? Our everyday use of the term is meant to describe someone who is knowledgeable and makes wise decisions, but this definition is at odds with how intelligence is traditionally measured. The most widely known measure of intelligence is the intelligence quotient , more commonly known as the IQ test, which includes visuospatial puzzles, math problems, pattern recognition, vocabulary questions, and visual searches. \nThe advantages of being intelligent are undeniable. Intelligent people are more likely to get better grades and go farther in school. They are more likely to be successful at work. And they are less likely to get into trouble (e.g., commit crimes) as adolescents. Given all the advantages of intelligence, though, you may be surprised to learn that it does not predict other life outcomes, such as well-being. You might imagine that doing well in school or at work might lead to greater life satisfaction, but several large scale studies have failed to find evidence that IQ impacts life satisfaction or longevity. Grossman and his colleagues argue that most intelligence tests fail to capture real-world decision-making and our ability to interact well with others. This is, in other words, perhaps why \u201csmart\u201d people, do \u201cdumb\u201d things. \nThe ability to think critically, on the other hand, has been associated with wellness and longevity. Though often confused with intelligence, critical thinking is not intelligence. Critical thinking is a collection of cognitive skills that allow us to think rationally in a goal-orientated fashion, and a disposition to use those skills when appropriate. Critical thinkers are amiable skeptics. They are flexible thinkers who require evidence to support their beliefs and recognize fallacious attempts to persuade them. Critical thinking means overcoming all sorts of cognitive biases (e.g., hindsight bias, confirmation bias, etc.). \nCritical thinking predicts a wide range of life events. In a series of studies, conducted in the United States and abroad , my colleagues and I have found that critical thinkers experience fewer bad things in life. We asked people to complete an inventory of life events and take a critical thinking assessment (the Halpern Critical Thinking Assessment). The critical thinking assessment measures 5 components of critical thinking skills including verbal reasoning, argument analysis, hypothesis testing, probability and uncertainty, decision-making, and problem-solving. The inventory of negative life events captures different domains of life such as academic (e.g., I forgot about an exam), health (e.g., I contracted a sexually transmitted infection because I did not wear a condom), legal (e.g., I was arrested for driving under the influence), interpersonal (e.g., I cheated on my romantic partner who I had been with for over a year), financial (e.g., I have over $5000 of credit card debt), etc. Repeatedly, we found that critical thinkers experience fewer negative life events. This is an important finding because there is plenty of evidence that critical thinking can be taught and improved. \nIs it better to be a critical thinker or to be intelligent? My latest research pitted critical thinking and intelligence against each other to see which was associated with fewer negative life events. People who were strong on either intelligence or critical thinking experienced fewer negative events, but critical thinkers did better. \nIntelligence and improving intelligence are hot topics that receive a lot of attention. It is time for critical thinking to receive a little more of that attention. Keith Stanovich wrote an entire book about What Intelligence Tests Miss . Reasoning and rationality more closely resemble what we mean when we say a person is smart than spatial skills and math ability. Furthermore, improving intelligence is difficult. Intelligence is largely determined by genetics. Critical thinking, though, can improve with training and the benefits have been shown to persist over time. Anyone can improve their critical thinking skills: Doing so, we can say with certainty, is a smart thing to do.

A gunman with an arsenal of 23 weapons killed more than 50 people and wounded more than 500 before killing himself, according to The New York Times . The Islamic State, a militant group, has claimed a connection to the gunman, but authorities have found no evidence for that claim.* \nThe Las Vegas massacre is a symptom of a problem more serious than terrorism: the lack of effective gun controls in the U.S. As I have reported previously , between 1970 and 2007, a total of 3,292 people in the U.S. were killed by terrorists. Almost all those deaths occurred on a single day, 9/11/01. That averages out to fewer than 100 deaths from terrorism a year. \nIn contrast, more than 32,000 Americans are shot to death every year, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence . Of those, more than 11,000 people are murdered and almost 20,000 kill themselves. The U.S., which has more firearms per capita than any other nation, has rates of gun-related killings much higher than any other developed nation . \nThe American fetish for guns hurts non-Americans, too. The U.S. is the world\u2019s leading source for small arms \u2014defined as weapons that can be carried and operated by a single person\u2014as it is for larger, more expensive weapons, such as tanks and jet fighters. \nThe Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated in a 2010 report that 875 million small arms are in circulation around the world. The report calls the proliferation of small arms \u201can immediate security challenge to individuals, societies, and states around the world and an enormous hurdle to sustainable security and development. Small arms fuel civil wars, organized criminal violence, and terrorist activities. They also undermine multimillion dollar development programs and other assistance to fragile states.\u201d \nVarious groups, such as the International Action Network on Small Arms , seek tighter national and international controls on the manufacture and trade of small arms. But the National Rifle Association has impeded international as well as domestic gun controls. President Donald Trump is more likely to ease controls than tighten them. He told the NRA in April , \u201cYou have a true friend and champion in the White House.\u201d \nIf the U.S. devoted as much effort to gun control as it does to countering terrorism, the world would be a much safer place. \n[*This column is adapted from ones I have posted after previous mass shootings.] \nFurther Reading :", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:36:09.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e74e022de7feac4d23ae6a3be68e59d1a93719cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnEHEoic96__Wm841r_rigHb1lB0de1OTUz9dfuBmkViItg7J6VxaA2i84C9M1FHT.j20p.hfT62F", "site_full": "www.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "http://rss.sciam.com/ScientificAmerican-Global\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Scientific American Content: Global", "title": "A Fix for the Antiscience Attitude in Congress", "title_full": "A Fix for the Antiscience Attitude in Congress", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/0CDADB2D-D970-4E70-B55BEDB6CB1B4B76_agenda.jpg?w=600&amp;h=335", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e74e022de7feac4d23ae6a3be68e59d1a93719cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnEHEoic96__Wm841r_rigHb1lB0de1OTUz9dfuBmkViItg7J6VxaA2i84C9M1FHT.j20p.hfT62F", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "THE EDITORS", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Fix for the Antiscience Attitude in Congress", "text": "A Fix for the Antiscience Attitude in Congress A group of objective expert advisers should counsel the Senate and House science committees Credit: Julia Yellow Advertisement \nThe White House and Congress have lost their way when it comes to science. Notions unsupported by evidence are informing decisions about environmental policy and other areas of national interest, including public health, food safety, mental health and biomedical research. The president has not asked for much advice from his Office of Science and Technology Policy, evidently. \nThe congressional committees that craft legislation on these matters do not even have formal designated science advisers. That's a big problem. Take the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. Its leader, Republican Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, clearly misunderstands the scientific process, which includes assessment by independent peer reviewers prior to publication. The result has been a nakedly antiscience agenda. The committee has packed its hearings with industry members as witnesses instead of independent researchers. Democratic members have felt compelled to hold alternative hearings because they feel Smith has not allowed the real experts to speak. Smith's misinformed leadership has made it clear that congressional science committees need to be guided by genuinely objective experts. \nSo far this year, Smith and fellow committee member Representative Frank Lucas of Oklahoma have each introduced bills that would seriously weaken the Environmental Protection Agency. Lucas's bill would help stack the EPA's Science Advisory Board with industry representatives and supporters. Smith's\u2014the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act\u2014would make it harder for the EPA to create rules based on good research. As Rush Holt, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a former representative and a nuclear physicist, said of an earlier version of the bill, this sort of legislation is nothing less than an attempt to \u201cfundamentally substitut[e] a [political] process for the scientific process.\u201d \nThis is lunacy. We should not allow elected officials\u2014especially the heads of congressional science committees\u2014to interfere with the scientific process, bully researchers or deny facts that fit poorly with their political beliefs. Instead of seeing science as a threat, officials should recognize it as an invaluable tool for improving legislation. \nTo educate members about the best available research, both the House and Senate science committees should create independent groups of impartial researchers and policy specialists to advise them on science and technology issues, including those related to energy, genetically modified foods, and clean air and water. (Industry representatives would still have a voice, but they would counsel the committees separately.) The advisers could provide counsel without advocating specific courses of action. The scientific community\u2014perhaps the heads of the National Academy of Sciences\u2014could select the advisers, who would serve limited terms. Policy makers would still make the decisions, but with help from experts, those decisions would at least be based on facts. \nCongress used to have a body of this kind\u2014the widely respected Office of Technology Assessment (OTA). The OTA was an office of Congress: it served members and committees, and a bipartisan board of senators and representatives oversaw it. Until 1995, the OTA created reports on scientific issues ranging from alternative fuels to cancer and presented Congress with options it could pursue to reach different goals. Then the Republican-controlled Congress axed its funding during budget cuts. Many have advocated for the OTA's return, including Scientific American . Last year Representative Bill Foster of Illinois introduced a resolution calling for its revival. \nWhether it comes from a resurrected OTA, a new, dedicated advisory panel or some other body, independent, evidence-based advice on scientific matters would provide a strong counterbalance to the opinions of special interests. Science would get a voice, no matter who was in power. This voice could not force members of Congress to accept scientific truth over alternative \u201cfacts.\u201d But at least it would give them the opportunity to do so. \nThis article was originally published with the title \"Put Science Back in Congress\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank lucas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lamar smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rush holt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national academy of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american association for the advancement of science", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "science advisory board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house committee on science", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of science and technology policy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julia yellow advertisement  the white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of technology assessment", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:11:23.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c11e5ecce6388539e259a1d0fecdc761cfe460d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnEwrwMpYTFlpuK5wpgV7cux6JmlVWZg_TsK0wdHXJG16HMEpzaGEhmQw2hkqgJEamo0iUTeemYzbPg7aiAs8u7_6JWvnJrQzHZ38FXRCSq9z", "site_full": "www.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "http://www.scientificamerican.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Scientific American Content: Global", "title": "Risk of Human-Triggered Earthquakes Laid Out in Biggest-Ever Database", "title_full": "Risk of Human-Triggered Earthquakes Laid Out in Biggest-Ever Database", "published": "2017-10-03T17:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c11e5ecce6388539e259a1d0fecdc761cfe460d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnEwrwMpYTFlpuK5wpgV7cux6JmlVWZg_TsK0wdHXJG16HMEpzaGEhmQw2hkqgJEamo0iUTeemYzbPg7aiAs8u7_6JWvnJrQzHZ38FXRCSq9z", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandra Witze", "published": "2017-10-03T17:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Risk of Human-Triggered Earthquakes Laid Out in Biggest-Ever Database", "text": "Print Share via A 7.8-magnitude earthquake that hit Nepal on April 30, 2015, has been linked by some to groundwater pumping. Credit: Chris McGrath Getty Images Advertisement \nFrom mining projects to oil and gas operations, human activity has set off earthquakes around the world and in many geological settings. Research now highlights how big these quakes can get \u2014 and how little scientists agree on which ones are caused by people. \nThe Human-Induced Earthquake Database , or HiQuake, contains 728 examples of earthquakes (or sequences of earthquakes) that may have been set off by humans over the past 149 years. Most of them were small, between magnitudes 3 and 4. But the list also includes several large, destructive earthquakes, such as the magnitude-7.8 quake in Nepal in April 2015, which one paper linked to groundwater pumping 1 . \nMiles Wilson, a hydrogeologist at Durham University, UK, and his colleagues describe the database in a paper set to be published on October 4 in Seismological Research Letters 2 . The scientists say that HiQuake is the biggest, most up-to-date public listing of human-caused quakes ever made. By bringing the data together in this way, they hope to highlight how diverse induced quakes can be \u2014 and help society to understand and manage the future risk. Earth-shaking activity \nHiQuake began in 2016, when the Dutch Petroleum Society (NAM), an oil and gas company based in Assen, funded a team of researchers at Durham and at Newcastle University, UK, to collect examples of induced earthquakes. NAM drills in the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands, where it has set off many small earthquakes. \nWilson\u2019s team trawled through sources including scientific papers and media accounts to come up with its 728 events. When a single project, such as a wastewater-injection well, set off more than one quake, the researchers counted those as a single event. Further details appear in Earth-Science Reviews 3 . \nThe result is a database in which the earliest entry dates to 1868, with a quake triggered by an Australian coal-mining operation. Of the 728 events, 271 (37%) are linked to mining \u2014 often from tunnel collapses. About 23% are linked to water piling up behind a dam and 15% to conventional oil and gas development. Just 4% are linked to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for oil and gas. Some of the more unusual cases involve quakes triggered by the building of heavy skyscrapers or by an underground nuclear-bomb test. Mass movement \nIn HiQuake, the fastest-growing quake-inducing activity in the database is the injection of wastewater back into the ground by oil and gas operations (see ' Shaking the earth '). The process that can increase stress on buried geological faults and cause them to generate small earthquakes. The number of these projects spiked in the early 2010s, at the height of wastewater-injection in Oklahoma and other parts of the central United States. \nThe largest event in the database is the magnitude-7.9 earthquake that struck in Sichuan, China, in 2008, which some have linked with the filling of a nearby reservoir 4 . Wilson says his team was initially startled to see quakes that large proposed as human-induced. But in retrospect, he says, \u201cwe probably shouldn\u2019t be surprised by any anthropogenic cause\u201d. All the projects linked to earthquakes \u2014 whether blasting a mining tunnel, injecting wastewater or pumping groundwater \u2014 involve moving mass around on Earth\u2019s surface in ways that can nudge already-stressed faults. \nThe scientists found a relationship between the volume of material moved \u2014 such as the size of the reservoir filled before the Chinese quake \u2014 and the magnitude of the largest linked earthquake that followed. No such relationship was seen with factors such as dam height or reservoir area. The researchers suggest that limiting the amount of material moved in a construction project could help to minimize any quakes triggered. Judgement calls \nAll possible instances of induced quakes were included \u201cwithout regard to plausibility\u201d, writes the team, because of the difficulty involved in deciding what constitutes absolute proof that an earthquake was caused by human activity. But that could mislead people about the real hazard from induced quakes, says Rapha\u00ebl Grandin, a geophysicist at the Institute of Earth Physics in Paris. \u201cWhen you put a dot in the database, and a scientific reference behind it, then you may lead the non-expert to think that the earthquake was caused by humans,\u201d he says. Such a listing might hide scientific uncertainty, as with the Chinese quake: despite the paper linking it to reservoir filling, many seismologists do not believe it was triggered by human activity 5 . \nSusan Hough, a seismologist at the US Geological Survey in Pasadena, California, says she understands why the HiQuake team included all possible instances of induced quakes. \u201cI suspect the authors were unwilling to pass judgement on published studies, which I consider a reasonable decision,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you start down the road, where do you stop?\u201d \nWilson agrees. \u201cAny judgement calls we leave to users,\u201d he says. \nOver time, HiQuake should become more useful as researchers add examples and references to its entries, says Gail Atkinson, a seismologist at the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada, who leads a Canadian collaboration to study induced seismicity . \nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on October 2, 2017.

Henze Advertisement \nEditor\u2019s Note (10/3/17): This year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish and Kip S. Thorne \u201cfor decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.\u201d This article is being resurfaced to highlight scientists\u2019 plans to hunt for the elusive spacetime ripples in the near and far future. \nA century ago, when Albert Einstein first predicted the existence of gravitational waves \u2014subtle ripples in spacetime produced by massive objects hurtling through the cosmos\u2014he also guessed they could not ever be seen. Although the echoes of distant celestial symphonies must ripple through the very fabric of reality, Einstein thought their ethereal harmonies were destined to remain eternally unheard. \nOn Thursday, scientists using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) proved Einstein both right and wrong, announcing their detection of the first note in a cosmic symphony he predicted no one would ever hear. It was a burbling chirp of gravitational waves produced by the cataclysmic birth of a black hole from the merger of two smaller ones. Emitted in a distant galaxy when multicellular life was just beginning to populate Earth, the waves traveled at the speed of light for more than a billion years to at last wash over our planet last September, taking just seven milliseconds to traverse the distance between LIGO\u2019s twin listening stations in Louisiana and Washington State. \nNow, unlike Einstein a century ago who could scarcely imagine gravitational waves ever being seen, the scientists hunting the elusive spacetime ripples already have big plans for more detectors and observatories in the near and far future. \n\u201cImagine light having never been collected in a photograph,\u201d says Janna Levin, an astrophysicist at Barnard College of Columbia University and author of a forthcoming book about LIGO. \u201cThe first thing people want to do is just to capture the recording, which is what LIGO has done.\u201d \nSoon, astronomers say , LIGO will record and unveil far more than the birth cries of newborn black holes. It and other operational observatories are already looking for ripples from the violent death throes of massive stars and from collisions of city-size orbs of degenerate matter called neutron stars. Current observatories could also help reveal what makes spinning neutron stars called pulsars tick, mapping their starquake-shaken interiors and any centimeters-high \u201cmountains\u201d (which would weigh roughly the mass of a planet because of neutron stars\u2019 extreme density) that could pop up on their surfaces. \nDecades from now new generations of space telescopes could capture the mergers of supermassive black holes and glimpse pulsars spiraling to doom down their maws, or see snapping \u201ccosmic strings,\u201d proton-thin intergalactic defects in spacetime that may have been stretched across the infant universe during an inflationary growth spurt. Tracked and timed by radio telescopes, rapidly spinning pulsars can themselves be transformed into galaxy-spanning detectors sensitive to spacetime ripples with wavelengths measured in light-years. Ultimately, the most ambitious gravitational wave observatories astronomers can presently conceive might someday record the hiss of waves emitted in the first fractions of a trillionth of a second after the big bang. Then, cosmologists could watch\u2014could listen\u2014as the first seeds of cosmic structure crystallized from a seething quantum fog. \nWhat most excites scientists, though, is the unknown. \u201cAre there things out there that we\u2019ve never even wrapped our heads around with telescopes?\u201d Levin wonders. \u201cSeeing black holes collide is a golden discovery, but we expected that. What else is out there? I want to see something dark.\u201d \n\u201cThe skies will never be the same,\u201d says Szabolcs M\u00e1rka, a physicist and LIGO team member at Columbia University. \u201cImagine you can touch, smell, taste, and see\u2014and one day you can hear. That day is a glorious day. This is what has happened to us, as humanity. From today, we can hear the cosmos. We can see the unseen.\u201d \nThe most expensive \u201cnothing\u201d ever made. Having found its first signal, LIGO is now gearing up to transform them into routine tools for astronomy. The twin LIGO stations each pass laser light back and forth between mirrors along perpendicular four-kilometer-long arms arranged in an L. An incoming wave would slightly warp these arms so that one became longer or shorter than the other by only a few thousandths the radius of a single proton, altering the flight time of the light and triggering a detection. Any number of background noises can scuttle the delicate measurement\u2014LIGO can also hear ocean waves pounding distant coastlines, airplanes flying overhead and even the seismic hum from washing machines. \n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to detect something smaller than the atoms our detector is built of,\u201d says Imre Bartos, a LIGO member and lecturer at Columbia University. \u201cIt doesn't sound believable, to be honest with you.\u201d That LIGO can hear gravitational waves at all over the cacophony of background noise is due to both stations recently receiving a series of noise-canceling \u201cAdvanced LIGO\u201d upgrades that will soon make them 10 times more sensitive than they were during a fruitless first-generation search that occurred between 2002 and 2010. All told, the upgrades bring the experiment\u2019s total cost to more than $1 billion, most of it paid by the National Science Foundation. LIGO\u2019s ultra-high-vacuum hermetic perfection, M\u00e1rka quips, is \u201cthe most expensive \u2018nothing\u2019 ever made.\u201d \nAs Advanced LIGO reaches its maximum sensitivity and plans a third listening station in India, it will work in tandem with other European laser interferometers such as GEO600 and Advanced VIRGO to rapidly make the detection of gravitational waves routine. \u201cWe've just made a machine that has given humanity a new sense, beyond the usual five,\u201d says LIGO team member Rana Adhikari, a Caltech physicist who helped develop the upgrades. \u201cWe're going to have to learn what it is like to feel the burbling of space with these brand-new gravitational fingers.\u201d \nWith gravitational waves set to soon ripple through several high-precision laser interferometers on Earth, astronomers will be also be able to locate where exactly each set of the ripples is coming from. LIGO\u2019s first detection of colliding black holes, by contrast, could only be traced to a huge arc of sky over the Southern Hemisphere. Pinpointing the sources of gravitational waves will allow astronomers to point other telescopes their way, boosting the chances of learning more about them via x-rays, gamma-rays, radio waves, neutrinos and more. \nBurying the noise The current generation of ground-based laser interferometers can only go so far, however. The length, number and location of an interferometer\u2019s arms intimately influence its resilience against background noise and the varieties of gravitational waves it can probe. LIGO\u2019s four-kilometer-long arms are the biggest in the world, but at the project\u2019s Louisiana site the encroaching, noisy sprawl of nearby Baton Rouge is getting too close for comfort to the delicate detectors. \nResearchers are now planning and building a next generation of even bigger and more isolated detectors deep beneath the ground where hundreds of meters of overlying rock shield against most anthropogenic noises and seismic stresses. In the Kamioka mine in Japan, the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA) is already taking shape as workers construct twin sets of three-kilometer arms in newly bored tunnels. Slated to enter operation in 2018, KAGRA will use cryogenically cooled mirrors of sapphire to deliver LIGO-like sensitivity. \nAfter KAGRA, a consortium of European partners is forming tentative plans for an even more ambitious subterranean laser interferometer, the Einstein Telescope, which could come online in the late 2020s at a cost of $1 billion or $2 billion. Although it presently lacks funding and a construction site, its conceptual design calls for dual cryogenic and room-temperature beam lines running through three 10-kilometer arms arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle rather than an L. That configuration would help it pinpoint the sources of gravitational waves on the sky and allow it to see the longer-wavelength ripples from a wider range of sources including binary white dwarfs, slower-spinning pulsars and intermediate-mass black holes weighing hundreds or thousands of suns. It would also begin to construct a reasonably detailed map of \u201cbackground\u201d sources of gravitational waves\u2014the accumulated ripples from all the messy, violent mergers and explosions all across the sky. \n\u201cPeople wonder why we are not content with one gravitational-wave detector, why we wish to build bigger ones,\u201d says Harald L\u00fcck, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hannover, Germany who is a member of the GEO600 and Einstein Telescope teams. \u201cLike electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves cover an incredibly large range of wavelengths, and you can\u2019t catch all of them with any single facility.\u201d On the ground, L\u00fcck says, the arms of laser interferometers are unlikely to ever exceed 50 kilometers\u2014past that, seismic noise, Earth\u2019s curvature, imperfect optics and the great expense of digging deep tunnels would outweigh any conceivable scientific gains. \nSooner or later, it will simply be cheaper to forsake Earth, to build and operate truly giant gravitational-wave observatories in space. \nSpace is the place Whenever the first gravitational wave mission launches into space, radio astronomers will wryly say they were there first. Using radio telescopes on the ground, researchers have already devised space-based gravitational wave detectors using nature\u2019s resources: large numbers of pulsars spread throughout space that spin once every few milliseconds, sending out lighthouse-like beams of light that reach us in regular beats. By cross-correlating the arrival times of all the different pulses to nanosecond precision across decades, astronomers hope to detect gravitational waves with wavelengths measured in light-months and light-years as their passing periodic ripples distort spacetime around Earth. Merging galaxies should produce such extra-large waves as supermassive black holes at their galactic cores lock into orbital pairs and eventually collide. As compelling as the technique is, it has yet to deliver any detections, although the likelihood of success grows over time as astronomers incorporate more pulsars into their observations. \nIn addition to using pulsar timing, many researchers hope to also study gravitational waves through space-based laser interferometers. Freely floating in deep space far from Earth\u2019s noise and gravity, such facilities could in theory boast arms of almost any length. In practice, however, designers of possible future missions have grappled with the great complexity of engineering such ambitious spacecraft as well as new frontiers of contaminating noise in space. Those limitations have constrained their designs to arm lengths of \u201conly\u201d millions of kilometers. \nIn the 2000s NASA and the European Space Agency jointly worked to develop a Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a constellation of three satellites that would form a triangular interferometer with three five-million-kilometer arms. That would be big enough to see gravitational waves emitted by any merging supermassive black holes that may have existed around the time when the universe\u2019s first stars began to shine, about a hundred million years after the big bang. \nIn 2011, however, NASA abandoned the effort due to its high estimated cost and shortfalls in the agency\u2019s science funding. ESA regrouped and downsized the project to become \u201ceLISA,\u201d an \u201cevolved\u201d design calling for three satellites forming one-million-kilometer arms that could lift off in the mid-2030s. Last December ESA launched eLISA\u2019s precursor, a technology development mission called LISA Pathfinder. Meanwhile, other researchers are attempting to develop an alternate space-based interferometry technology that uses microscopic clouds of atoms rather than bulky spacecraft to further shrink the need for long, expensive baselines. \nRegardless of the interferometric technique used, \u201cthe science case for a space-based interferometer has never been in doubt,\u201d says Paul McNamara, ESA\u2019s project scientist for LISA Pathfinder. \u201cIt would allow us to look at the biggest, most violent events in the universe and map the entire history of mergers across a huge slice of cosmic time\u2026. What has always been in doubt is whether it is possible to build an instrument that can measure to picometer-precision across millions of kilometers after having the life shaken out of it by a rocket launch.\u201d \nCurrently under commissioning in an orbit some 1.5 million kilometers sunward of Earth, LISA Pathfinder is set to begin science operations in March, although it will not be capable of seeking gravitational waves. Instead, it will demonstrate that its payload of two gold-platinum cubes can come as close as possible to a state of weightless, perfect rest. Held in a shielded vacuum enclosure within the spacecraft, the cubes should feel essentially no outside forces other than gravity. If separated by millions of kilometers and linked by lasers, such a system could then detect the exquisitely small distance changes caused by passing gravitational waves. Reaching a state of perfect rest within a sunlight-baked spacecraft studded with heaters, antennas, and thrusters is far from easy, however. \n\u201cThink of the weight of a bacterium sitting on your hand\u2014that\u2019s roughly the same amount of residual acceleration, of force, that a cube [is allowed to] deviate from freefall\u201d on the spacecraft, McNamara says. Lasers on LISA Pathfinder measure a cube\u2019s distance from the enclosure\u2019s walls, directing microthrusters that keep the spacecraft centered on the cube. The microthrusters are so minuscule that a thousand firing at full blast could barely lift a sheet of notebook paper in Earth\u2019s gravity\u2014yet the 450-kilogram LISA Pathfinder only carries six. \nMapping the newborn cosmos In 2005, before it abandoned LISA, NASA conducted a small study investigating a possible super-sized successor comprising a complex arrangement of four LISA-like constellations with beefier lasers and telescopes. Called the \u201cBig Bang Observer,\u201d the mission as conceived would probably be so astonishingly expensive that few if any researchers have dared to actually estimate its price tag. It would be sensitive to nearly all the same targets investigated by LIGO and LISA out to distances of 10 billion light-years or more, but its true goal would be to assemble a detailed map of gravitational waves from the earliest eras of the primordial universe. \nThis \u201cstochastic gravitational wave background\u201d would contain crucial information about the universe\u2019s very first moments and its mysterious era of inflation, when it seems to have almost instantaneously ballooned from proton- to grapefruit-sized, amplifying quantum-scale density fluctuations along the way that shaped the first large-scale cosmic structures. In its importance for our understanding of\u2014well, everything\u2014measuring such a signal would be even more revolutionary than mapping the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the relic light from when the early universe first cooled to transparency some 380,000 years after the big bang. \nThe CMB is a literal firewall on efforts to peer further back in time using light\u2014nearly all information about earlier events carried by photons was erased as they bounced aimlessly within the hot, dense plasma that suffused the infant universe. Yet for primordial gravitational waves, the CMB is not a firewall\u2014it is a window. Those with very long wavelengths could leave faint imprints in the CMB to mark their passing. Most primordial waves would breeze through without a trace, however, scarcely interacting with anything else in the universe for all the rest of time\u2014at least until they ripple through the right detector. \n\u201cIn a way, the stochastic background is the hardest thing to detect, but also the one which would offer you the most insight, because black holes and neutron stars are kind of old hat,\u201d says Bruce Allen, a LIGO team member and director of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics. \u201cLet\u2019s suppose we jump ahead a thousand years to when our highly advanced civilization has built observatories that cover the whole gravitational spectrum.\u201d Such tools could map the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves and perhaps distinguish \u201ckinks and bumps\u201d within it that reveal the earliest and most epochal milestones in the universe\u2019s evolution. \n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not a thousand years away,\u201d Allen goes on. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just a century until something like the Big Bang Observer, and a century after that we\u2019ll build something broadband. What matters is that getting the stochastic background\u2019s spectrum is one of the last things humans will ever be able to do with studies of gravitational waves. Somewhere out there in the universe there\u2019s probably a civilization that has already done it.

Young, one of the recipients of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research shedding light on the inner workings of the biological clock, poses in his lab at the Rockefeller University in New York on October 2, 2017. Credit: Jewel Samad Getty Images Advertisement \nOn October 2 researchers from the University of Geneva published a paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on their discovery of a type of biological clock in muscle cells. The same day three researchers\u2014Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young\u2014learned they had received the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for studies that identified key genes that control biological timepieces. \nYoung had written an article for Scientific American in 2000 describing the work that led to the Nobels. In it he included a sidebar entitled \u201cClocks Everywhere: They Are Not Just in the Brain\u201d highlighting work by others in fruit flies that showed it was not just the brain that had such clocks. The Nobelists had focused on fruit fly brains but circadian mechanisms turned up in the kidneylike Malpighian tubules of fruit flies as well as in the wings, legs, oral regions and antennae of the insects. \nYoung ended his sidebar with this observation: \u201cThe diversity of the various cell types displaying circadian clock activity suggests that for many tissues correct timing is important enough to warrant keeping track of it locally. The findings might give new meaning to the term \u2018body clock.\u2019\u201d \nIn the last 15 years the sidebar has become a \u201cmainbar\u201d as molecular timekeeping apparatuses outside the brain have drawn increasing attention\u2014the Geneva paper being one such example. In 2015 Keith Summa and Fred Turek of Northwestern University wrote an article for Scientific American \u2014\u201cThe Clocks within Us\u201d\u2014that chronicled how the search for clock genes had extended into humans and reached beyond the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master clock in the brain that tracks time based on cues from light and darkness. \nThe research in humans now provides evidence of the importance of these local clocks that the authors say \u201cregulate the activity of 3 to 10 percent\u2014and in some cases perhaps as much as 50 percent\u2014of genes in various tissues,\u201d Summa and Turek wrote. What\u2019s more, when these local clocks go out of sync with the brain\u2019s master clock, bad things often happen. Anomalies in circadian rhythms can lead to metabolic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal\u2014and even neurodegenerative problems. \nThe scrutiny brought to circadian biology by the Nobels should also highlight the limits of the prizes themselves in rewarding the best work in science. All of the winners of the Physiology or Medicine prize had unquestionably done \u201cNobel caliber\u201d science. But research relies on casts of hundreds, if not thousands\u2014the multitude now researching local clocks is just one example. \nThe chronobiology field, too, has a long history before and after the Nobel studies. In the 1970s Seymour Benzer and Ronald Konopka at the California Institute of Technology had localized one of the genes that was cited in awarding the Nobels\u2014a gene called period. But it was the three prize winners who ultimately cloned and sequenced it. Later Joseph Takahashi at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center discovered genes involved in activating expression of period and other clock genes\u2014a vital component of the molecular timekeeping process. \nAll of these scientists also did Nobel-quality work. The decisions of the Nobel Committee might have been different if Benzer and Konopka were still alive or they were allowed to award a fourth prize.

Several, contacted by Reuters, said they had few or none to sell and wanted mainly to rule out future investments and urge others to divest. \nThe Assisi municipality allied itself with the 40. \n\"Many people say that Assisi is the city on the mountain - all people can see the choices, political and environmental, that Assisi takes,\" mayor Stefania Proietti told Reuters. \nShe said the town was investing in cleaner energy, such as solar panels on rooftops, and electric vehicles. TOMB LIGHTS \nThe Sacro Convento said it wanted \"to end the fossil fuels era in the global economy.\" It had installed low-energy lighting by Saint Francis' tomb. \nThe Pope credits Saint Francis, known for his poverty and love of nature, in a 2015 encyclical urging action to halt global warming to safeguard the planet. \nThe 40 also include the Catholic archdiocese of Cape Town, Germany's Bank fur Kirche und Caritas eG, Oikocredit Belgium, the Australian Jesuit Province, Newman University in England and the U.S. Center for Action and Contemplation. \nSome investors, such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and universities, have sold fossil fuel stocks especially since the 195-nation Paris climate agreement set a goal in 2015 of phasing out use of fossil fuels this century. \nU.S. President Donald Trump, however, said in June he plans to pull out of the pact and promote jobs in the U.S. fossil fuel industry. \nMainstream scientists say fossil fuels contribute to heat waves, floods, droughts and rising seas. \nThe Catholic Church claims 1.2 billion members. \nBen Caldecott, founding director of the Oxford sustainable finance programme at the University of Oxford, said: \"Groups with moral authority, religious groups being a good example, are likely to have a disproportionate impact in terms of increasing stigma\" of investing in fossil fuels. \nThe International Energy Agency projects that fossil fuels will account for more than half of world energy demand in 2040, even with a big green shift. Fossil fuel companies such as Exxon Mobil or Royal Dutch Shell say they are limiting emissions. \n\"Today's announcement is a further sign we are on the way to achieving our collective mission,\" said Christiana Figueres, the U.N.'s climate chief at the time of the Paris Agreement. \"We still have a long way to go, however.\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stefania proietti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pope francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christiana figueres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben caldecott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alister doyle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "catholic groups seek climate action", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sacro convento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exxon mobil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic church", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global catholic climate movement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal dutch shell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giuseppe ciccia getty images advertisement  oslo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newman university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international energy agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook credit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank fur kirche und caritas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. center for action", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cape town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oikocredit belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assisi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:04:26.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88ac29410cf21e0bfe67dfe3773832e497a471f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnOnsz2L.vM5KKUaUcJ28wGBfHfZrOJlQV39vKNDjfEkrqaxpZ4AAQdlVJvUDEKaz7A--", "site_full": "www.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Most Americans Want Climate Change Policies - Scientific American", "title_full": "Most Americans Want Climate Change Policies - Scientific American", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.184, "main_image": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/B7975597-9FD2-4018-82349712A536EDC8_agenda.jpg?w=600&amp;h=335", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "88ac29410cf21e0bfe67dfe3773832e497a471f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnOnsz2L.vM5KKUaUcJ28wGBfHfZrOJlQV39vKNDjfEkrqaxpZ4AAQdlVJvUDEKaz7A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adam Aton Climatewire", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Most Americans Want Climate Change Policies - Scientific American", "text": "Climate Most Americans Want Climate Change Policies But in a new poll, half say they would not pay more on their electric bill to help lower emissions By Adam Aton , ClimateWire on October 3, 2017 Share on Facebook Credit: Hero Images Getty Images Advertisement \nMost Americans want their government to do more to address climate change\u2014as long as it doesn't take a big toll on their pocketbooks, according to a new poll. \nAbout 7 in 10 respondents said climate change is happening, according to results released yesterday from the University of Chicago and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That's about the same result the poll registered this time last year, and it aligns with survey results released this summer from Yale and George Mason universities. \nOnly about half of those respondents blamed human activity for warming temperatures, but 61 percent of them\u2014including 43 percent of Republicans\u2014said it's a problem the government needs to tackle. \nTrevor Tompson, director of the AP-NORC Center, said the bipartisan agreement on climate change's existence could be reason to hope for policy action: \"Public opinion around many energy issues tends to be fluid, with people often defaulting to partisan starting points. But this survey shows an opportunity for consensus building through discussion and debate.\" \nThe poll suggested the public knows little about specific energy issues, with money driving people's views more than health or environmental considerations. \nMost respondents said they would support policies to lower emissions, but half said they would be unwilling to pay even $1 more on their electric bill to do so. If climate policies cost an extra $10 per month, 60 percent of respondents said they would oppose them. \nPolitical leanings\u2014more than income, education or geographic location\u2014were the biggest indicator of whether someone would pay a modest fee to combat climate change. \nOther studies have also suggested politics has more to do with attitudes toward climate policy than with economics. \nAs the U.S. economy slumped between 2008 and 2012, multiple surveys showed Americans' belief in climate change dropped about 10 percentage points before rebounding. \nResearchers who tracked the same individuals during the downturn found that economic factors didn't influence opinions at all. Instead, people were responding to cues from political and opinion leaders\u2014specifically tea party Republicans who cast doubt on climate science. \nOrdinary people can't be experts on everything, so most folks look to people they respect\u2014church leaders, the president, neighbors\u2014for cues on issues of expertise, like climate change, said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. \n\"For those people who are dyed-in-the-wool Trump supporters, they look to him and he's their leader, and what he says is the truth. For other people, it's Republicans [in general], so they'll look beyond Trump to what other Republican leaders are saying,\" said Leiserowitz, who was not involved in the University of Chicago-AP poll. 20% want Clean Power Plan axed \nWith the Trump administration poised to replace the Clean Power Plan, about 40 percent of those polled said they oppose rolling back the Obama administration's climate rule. About the same number of people said they have no opinion, and 20 percent said they want it gone. \nThe Trump administration is also preparing to attend the first global climate conference since announcing the United States' intention to quit the Paris climate agreement. Twenty-eight percent of people support the decision to exit Paris, according to this poll, and 42 percent oppose it. \nThe results suggest the Paris Agreement's potential costs were the biggest reason people wanted out. \nHydraulic fracturing registered little support, with 41 percent of the poll's respondents opposed to it and 37 giving no opinion on it. Seventeen percent said they favor it. \nSeventeen percent of those polled also said they favor the direction of U.S. energy policy, but 45 percent said they have no feelings on it. \nThe poll's margin of error was 4.1 percentage points, and it surveyed more than 1,000 adults on the web or by phone Aug. 17-21. \nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&E News.

Why so terribly few? By Christophe Andr\u00e9 on October 4, 2017 Share on Facebook Marie Curie in her laboratory. Credit: Photos.com Getty Images Advertisement \nAbout 1,600 years ago, the Egyptian mathematician and philosopher Hypatia was stoned in public\u2014according to some accounts, by order of the Bishop of Alexandria, because she was a woman, a pagan, and in particular much too smart. In human societies, it always seems as if men, from time immemorial, have done everything possible to deny women access to knowledge and power, which are often linked. This hold began to loosen only during the Renaissance, when girls were (very) gradually allowed, and then encouraged, to pursue the same studies as boys. But the road has been long, and there is still quite a way to go. \nConsider, for example, the Nobel Prize, a universal symbol of excellence and the subject of Dix-Sept Femmes prix Nobel des sciences (\u201cSeventeen Women Who Won a Nobel Prize for Science\u201d by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Merle-B\u00e9ral, professor of hematology at Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris. As the title indicates, only 17 women have been awarded a science Nobel Prize since its inception in 1901. That amounts to three percent of all prizewinners. Why should that be? \nThere are at least three explanations. First, oppression along with objective and official discrimination of women long relegated them to secondary roles and served to deter them from science. In Western Europe, this era is more or less over, but naturally the vestiges of it remain: although girls are reclaiming the world of science little by little, it will take several generations before they accede to positions of power beyond the administrative level. \nThe second explanation has to do with male stereotypes of women, which are nowhere close to disappearing. A 2015 survey showed that 67 percent of men believe that women lack the capacity to become first-rate scientists. Hence the unconscious temptation of parents and teachers to discourage girls from these careers. \nMost worrisome, however, is that the same survey showed that 66 percent of women believe it too! This is the third, more insidious hurdle: women\u2019s own internalization of stereotypes about themselves leads most of them to self-limit and to voluntarily reject careers connected to science and power. \nThis phenomenon\u2014the \u201cstereotype threat\u201d\u2014is well known. U.S. researchers demonstrated it in 1995 with respect to African Americans. Given a complex intellectual task to solve, African American subjects performed as well as whites, except when a group composed of both black and white volunteers was reminded that they would be taking a complicated intelligence test. This seemingly innocuous information evoked the racist stereotype about blacks being generally less intellectually endowed than whites. Disconcerted by the racist clich\u00e9s, a significant number of blacks performed less well. The same phenomenon was subsequently identified in girls with respect to math and technical skills, though the latter is obviously less of a social handicap. \nAs is often the case, these toxic stereotypes contain what appear to be \u201ckernels of truth\u201d but in fact are distorted and erroneous. Thus, according to one argument, inequalities are justified by taking the actual situation as proof (and not the consequence) of the stereotype. For example, \u201cThe fact that there are fewer women scientists proves that women are worse in science.\u201d \nA second type of argument may be based in reality but has nothing to do with the actual situation. For instance, even taking body size into account, women typically have smaller brains than men: 1130 cubic centimeters for women compared with 1260 cubic centimeters for men. But it is impossible to conclude anything from that fact, because we also know that large brains are not necessarily more efficient. Einstein had an ordinary-sized brain. And brains, be they large or small, are designed to thrive and find inspiration. In this sense, it is interesting to see how social evolution (giving girls a chance) has affected their scientific scores, such as in math. \nIn the U.S. in the 1970s, boys and girls performed at the same level in math in primary school. Then, beginning at age 12, boys typically did better. Thirty years later\u2014following the women\u2019s liberation movement and the fight for equality\u2014a new study was conducted involving nearly seven million students: the difference between the sexes had evaporated. Today, talented girls no longer eschew advanced studies, whether scientific or otherwise, although more of them choose life sciences (medicine or biology) over more abstract disciplines (math or physics). Other studies show that as social equality between and women increases, the level of math achievement for both sexes also becomes more comparable. \nClich\u00e9s about the intellectual superiority of men are being rejected and fought with ever greater frequency: we are on the right track to improvement. But women need to be aware of their susceptibility to the \u201cstereotype threat.\u201d They can also take heart from the example of pioneering scientist Marie Curie: this extraordinary woman is still the only person to have received Nobel prizes in two different disciplines (physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911). \nGentlemen, can you top that? \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T13:02:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c2a485789a15897c7bf0309c46bd463e8ce03a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnBNx0SQfLhPVHx3Y9JS6nEOtTkHIqkqAHk1YM4IMIBoxBOayvFuTSDvwNv_5ji87Ht0tI4bWt0eE", "site_full": "www.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Are the Nobel Prizes Missing Female Scientists? - Scientific American", "title_full": "Are the Nobel Prizes Missing Female Scientists? - Scientific American", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/96491E3D-5734-425C-9A81C8D649A27693_agenda.jpg?w=600&amp;h=335", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c2a485789a15897c7bf0309c46bd463e8ce03a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnBNx0SQfLhPVHx3Y9JS6nEOtTkHIqkqAHk1YM4IMIBoxBOayvFuTSDvwNv_5ji87Ht0tI4bWt0eE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jesse Emspak Livescience", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Are the Nobel Prizes Missing Female Scientists? - Scientific American", "text": "Policy & Ethics Are the Nobel Prizes Missing Female Scientists?

Credit: Public Domain Advertisement \nThe Nobel Prize has a woman problem. \nA total of 203 people have won the Nobel Prize in physics , but only two were women (Marie Curie in 1903 and Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1963). Many scientists say those numbers point to a fundamental problem with the prizes and how they are awarded. \nScience writer and physicist Matthew Francis wrote on his blog, Galileo's Pendulum , that the prize favors men of European descent, and European and American researchers in general. That bias, he said, is part of a larger problem of excluding women and minorities for consideration. \n\"The difficulty may ultimately lie in the fact that it's nearly impossible to honor the science without tripping up on which scientists to assign that honor to,\" Francis wrote in an email to Live Science. [ Nobel Prize 2016: Here Are the Winners (and What They Achieved) ] Women in science \n\"I do think that, increasingly, the Nobels have a public relations problem,\" said Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Washington in Seattle. \nPrescod-Weinstein and many others noted on Twitter (with the hashtag #NobelforVeraRubin) the example of Vera Rubin. Rubin discovered the anomalies in the way galaxies rotate that provided evidence for the existence of dark matter , one of the universe's greatest scientific mysteries . This accomplishment was not awarded a Nobel Prize, although many scientists (and nonscientists) say it deserved the honor. \nSearching #NobelforVeraRubin yields many people calling for Rubin to be recognized. Nobel prizes can't be awarded posthumously, and Rubin is 88 years old\u2014so there's a sense of urgency. As science writer Rachel Feltman of The Washington Post tweeted, \"Vera Rubin deserves a Nobel. She probably won't get one in time.\" \nEmily Levesque, an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Washington, tweeted, \"yet another year has now passed without the # NobelPrize recognizing the groundbreaking detection of dark matter by Vera Rubin...\" and \"Dark matter utterly revolutionized our concept of the universe; it's basically spawned entire subfields within physics at this point.\" [ Female Firsts: 7 Women Who Broke Barriers in Science and Tech ] \nPhysics isn't the only field with a dearth of female Nobel laureates. According to the Nobel Committee website, 171 people have won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, and only four have been women: Marie Curie (1911), her daughter Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie (1935), Dorothy Hodgkin (1964) and Ada Yonath (2009). \nWomen have fared a bit better in medicine and literature. Out of the 211 total recipients of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, 12 have been women. And of the 112 total recipients of the Nobel Prize in literature, 15 have been women. Women have picked up 16 Nobel Peace Prizes of the 129 that have been awarded to either individuals or organizations. The Nobel Prize in economics, which has existed only since 1969, has honored only one woman of the 76 laureates. \nIt isn't as though women haven't been nominated, though the numbers are still small. Lise Meitner was nominated no less than 48 times by different people between 1937 and 1965 for prizes in physics and chemistry. (She died in 1968, having never been awarded a Nobel.) Astrophysicist Margaret Burbidge was nominated in 1964 for the Nobel in physics; that year the Nobel laureates in physics were Charles Hard Townes, Nicolay Gennadiyevich Basov and Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov for work in electronics that allowed for new kinds of transistors. Award structure \nThe way Nobel Prizes are awarded could partly explain why women are underrepresented, some researchers say. First, it can take time to measure the impact of scientific work. Sometimes, the prize for a particular scientific accomplishment is not awarded until decades after the initial research is done, though that's not always the case. [ What's Missing From the Nobel Prizes? Scientists Weigh In ] \nAnother major problem, many scientists say, is that no more than three people can share a prize\u2014but that doesn't reflect how science is actually done . Most research, especially in physics, involves many people\u2014there can be up to hundreds of authors listed on a typical particle-physics paper, for example. (In fact, in physics, authors are often listed in alphabetical order for this very reason). A recent article in Science noted that if the physics Nobel had been awarded to the LIGO team, for the observation of gravitational waves, a contender might be Barry Barrish, who was instrumental in building the interferometer. \n\"I definitely think it should be possible to award the prize to teams,\" said Prescod-Weinstein. For example, in 2011, three men won the Noble Prize for the discovery that the universe's expansion is speeding up\u2014an idea known as cosmic acceleration. \n\"The cosmic acceleration discovery was definitely a team effort, including making sure the data was correctly interpreted when they first started looking at it,\" Prescod-Weinstein said. \nMaria von Konow, communications manager for Nobel Media, noted that Alfred Nobel's will and the Swedish Academy of Sciences set the criteria for nominations. The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to organizations, but the rules that were set up to award the physics prize were different. It's possible for the rules to change \u2013 the Nobel Foundation statutes have a procedure for doing so. But so far there's been no action on that front, at least not publicly. \nFrancis added that an entirely different award structure might be a good idea. \"Ideally, there should be a range of prizes, whether called Nobels or not, to honor both discoverers and pioneers, but also to adequately honor collaborations (instead of just their leaders, who tend to be white guys because they get promotions denied to others) and recent work, rather than primarily decades-old research,\" he said in a an email to Livescience. \nRighting past omissions would also help, Prescod-Weinstein said. For example, in 1974, the Nobel prize in physics was awarded to two recipients\u2014Antony Hewish and Martin Ryle\u2014for the 1967 discovery of pulsars, a type of star that pulses rapidly. Yet the actual discovery made by poring over the data from radio telescopes, was the work of Jocelyn Bell. \n\"Tthe prize should be able to retroactively correct errors, such as Jocelyn Bell not receiving the prize for her own discovery, with her advisor getting it instead,\" Prescod-Weinstein said. \nCan the Nobels be fixed? Prescod-Weinstein said the committee could be more open to changes in how it awards the prizes. \n\"Eventually, it becomes hard to take the selections seriously, because we have no idea what factors are taken into consideration, except that somehow, it ends with only white and Asian men receiving the prize,\" Prescod-Weinstein said. (Sir William Arthur Lewis is the sole black Nobel laureate in the sciences [economics, 1979], and there are six science laureates who are Latino.) \nThe nominations for the prizes, and the deliberations that went into the awards, are kept secret for 50 years. So it's hard to know whether more women were nominated in the 1970s and 1980s, and we won't know for another decade. It's possible Rubin, for example, was nominated, and passed over. \nSome, like Francis, say it might be time to retire the Nobels. \"They're fundamentally about something that's not an adequate reflection of real science, and they reinforce the worst aspects of the culture of science,\" he said. \"Maybe we should dump 'em and start over.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dorothy hodgkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prescod-weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesse emspak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william arthur lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles hard townes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily levesque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ada yonath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolay gennadiyevich basov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret burbidge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vera rubin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria von konow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antony hewish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lise meitner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry barrish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin ryle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chanda prescod-weinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alfred nobel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria goeppert-mayer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ir\u00e8ne joliot-curie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel feltman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jocelyn bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aleksandr mikhailovich prokhorov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rubin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marie curie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "swedish academy of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nobel media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nobel foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ligo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook print share", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nobel committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galileo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the washington post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "livescience", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T13:28:51.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b08a22912304719f30f2812990481ada35727296", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5uZPN3X4eW_DhlW3jLrzBfIMpvEG9oKUHYByL6siHruJ1bl1XJNTOKAEhpL9JUOd_mcweBqCuFagnjQTsCA4ArFbuHIxFIsRP_AH01u9fI0sw--", "site_full": "www.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "http://www.medicalwebtimes.com/feeds.php?page=25469", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Medical Web Times - Medical News Headlines", "title": "Nobel in Chemistry for Seeing Biomolecules in Action", "title_full": "Nobel in Chemistry for Seeing Biomolecules in Action", "published": "2017-10-04T07:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/BF582A08-4016-4841-ABCF916A44C38C4F_agenda.jpg?w=600&amp;h=335", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b08a22912304719f30f2812990481ada35727296", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5uZPN3X4eW_DhlW3jLrzBfIMpvEG9oKUHYByL6siHruJ1bl1XJNTOKAEhpL9JUOd_mcweBqCuFagnjQTsCA4ArFbuHIxFIsRP_AH01u9fI0sw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T07:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nobel in Chemistry for Seeing Biomolecules in Action", "text": "Nobel in Chemistry for Seeing Biomolecules in Action Subscribe: Print Share via \nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry goes to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution. \n\n\u201cThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry jointly to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson \u2026for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution.\" \nG\u00f6ran Hansson, secretary general of the Academy, at 5:53 this morning Eastern time. \nDubochet is honorary professor at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.

Everyday Einstein talks to Rep. Lois Frankel about women in STEM By Everyday Einstein Sabrina Stierwalt on October 4, 2017 Share on Facebook Credit: Chris Ryan Getty Images Advertisement \nLast week the Women\u2019s Congressional Policy Institute hosted the Fifth Annual Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) Fair in Washington, D.C. A theme of the bipartisan event is encouraging more participation in science and technology fields from women at all career stages, a topic near and dear to my heart. \nThe fair has both nonprofit and private sector partners in attendance that give science demos, offer information on programs they have to promote women in STEAM fields, as well as provide examples of careers available to those interested in pursuing a science-based education. I was there with L\u2019Oreal USA to discuss their grants program for early career women scientists which has funded my research in the past as well as to give science demonstrations with my infrared camera. \nAlso supporting the fair was the Congressional Caucus for Women\u2019s Issues, including Caucus Co-Chairs Representative Susan Brooks and Representative Lois Frankel and Caucus Vice-Chairs Representative Mimi Walters and Representative Brenda Lawrence. I got a chance to sit down with Representative Lois Frankel before the event to get her advice on how we can increase the participation of women in science-related fields.

They were divided into an experimental group, which received the test drug, and a placebo group, which was given a medically inactive compound. Over the course of 14 weeks the youngsters receiving CBD experienced a median number of 5.9 convulsive seizures per month (down from 12.4) compared with 14.1 convulsions per month (down from 14.9) for the placebo group. The new findings are consistent with previous, less-stringent studies of the same drug, a compound called Epidiolex, made by U.K.\u2013based GW Pharmaceuticals. (GW funded the new study.) \nAs the current paper points out, \u201cinterest in cannabidiol for the treatment of epilepsy was generated by media reports of efficacy in children with Dravet syndrome.\u201d The star of many of those reports was Charlotte Figi, now 10, of Colorado, who was having hundreds of seizures a month by age three when her parents decided to treat her with cannabidiol. Unlike the better-known marijuana component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol does not make users high. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use, and the conditions approved for treatment can vary from state to state. Sixteen states have laws that specifically allow the use of CBD to treat seizures. \nThe Figis treated their daughter with a specially prepared CBD-containing oil, now known as Charlotte\u2019s Web, which is derived from hemp, a type of cannabis containing less than 0.3 percent THC by weight. They reported dramatic improvement. As word spread, more families tried CBD and the positive anecdotes piled up. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly one of the motivations for this research,\u201d Devinsky says. He notes there is also plenty of animal model data as well as anecdotes from the late 1800s about Indian hemp, another type of cannabis, that was used to treat epilepsy. And there are even mentions of the approach in Sumerian tablets going back 3,800 years. \u201cThe parents added fuel to the fire,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that anecdotal evidence was there for millennia.\u201d \nAll of the patients in the new trial fit the criteria for severe, drug-resistant epilepsy and were taking other seizure medications. Whereas there was a statistically and clinically significant median reduction in convulsive seizures of 39 percent in the treated group, only three of the 52 patients receiving cannabidiol became completely seizure-free. And 93 percent of those patients reported troublesome side effects\u2014including sleepiness (the most common symptom), vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea and elevated levels of liver enzymes. Eight of the cannabidiol patients stopped participating in the study as a result of the more severe side effects. The study authors indicate some of those issues could have been caused by interactions with other epilepsy drugs. Also, there was no significant reduction in nonconvulsive seizures, which are essentially brief staring spells in which a person is unaware of his or her surroundings for several seconds. The study notes this could be because cannabidiol only affects convulsive seizures or because nonconvulsive seizures \u201ccannot be reliably counted by parents in developmentally delayed children.\u201d \nNevertheless, 62 percent of caregivers in the cannabidiol group said their child\u2019s overall condition improved during the trial, compared with 34 percent in the placebo group. After the trial caregivers of participants in both the placebo and experimental groups were given the option of continuing treatment with cannabidiol in what is called an open-label extension of the study. More than 100 families from both groups took researchers up on the offer. \nSam Riggio, director of operations for Realm of Caring, a cannabis research, education and advocacy group, understands how even treatments with limited benefits can have a big impact on Dravet patients. Riggio and his wife Tara moved to Colorado from Illinois in 2013 when they heard about cannabidiol in a Dravet group on Facebook. (At the time, the hemp supply in the U.S. was spotty. Charlotte\u2019s Web had a reputation as safe and effective for children, but it was only available to Colorado residents.) Their daughter Francesca, who will be seven next month, was having seizures that never lasted less than 15 minutes and sometimes went on for long as 70 minutes. She had her first seizure at six months and at 18 months suffered a severe reaction to an epilepsy drug that left her with profound cognitive deficits. Then her parents started her on cannabidiol. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the answer for her like it was for Charlotte and some of the other kiddos,\u201d Riggio says, \u201cbut it provided her enough cushion that she could come off the three pharmaceuticals she was on.\u201d In the years since, while Francesca remains nonverbal with the cognition of an 18-month old, most of her seizures now last less than two minutes and resolve on their own. Her parents have not had to call 911 nor have they had to rush her to the emergency room. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge improvement for her quality of life,\u201d says Riggio, who credits the changes to cannabidiol. \nDevinsky hopes these latest findings will persuade the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to change its classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, a ruling that hampers medical research and treatment. (Drugs on Schedule I, such as heroin, are deemed by the DEA to have \u201cno currently accepted medical use.\u201d) \u201cTo put CBD as a Schedule I drug violates scientific data and common sense,\u201d Devinsky says. He points out that someopiates, which kill thousands of Americans a year, are Schedule III drugs, a less restricted category. \u201cCannabis is approved in 20 countries for spasms in multiple sclerosis,\u201d he says, \u201cso to say there\u2019s no evidence of efficacy is simply untrue. Those studies came out a decade ago, this study is coming out today. They have to de-schedule this drug. It\u2019s just not fair to the research and clinical communities, or to the patients.

Credit: Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Advertisement \nJust before noon today, Stockholm time, three real visionaries struck scientific gold: the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The researchers had developed ways of imaging complex proteins at the atomic level, adopting electron microscopes to see how the molecules create antibiotic resistance, convert light into energy for photosynthesis and how the Zika virus functions. \u201cFor developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution,\u201d the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Chemistry Prize to Jacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, Joachim Frank of Columbia University in New York City, and Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. \n\"This discovery is like the Google Earth for molecules in that it takes us down to the fine detail of atoms within proteins,\u201d says chemist Allison Campbell, president of the American Chemical Society, who has done research in biomaterials. And although the Nobel Committee emphasized the biological and medical applications, Campbell says the method can be used to analyze any type of polymer, such as industrial enzymes that break down plastics. \nFrank, in a phone call during the Nobel announcement, noted the practical uses were not here yet. \u201cThis is not an immediate bedside application. Several years will go by,\u201d he said. And Campbell agrees. \u201cThis is technology on the front end,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the potential is huge. You could understand any target molecule that you are going after. You can see its shape, and when proteins change shape they change function.\u201d \nThis is the second chemistry Nobel for microscopy in the past four years. In 2014 Stefan Hell, Eric Betzig, and William Moerner won for increasing the power of light microscopy and allowing scientists to see molecules in action within a living cell, although not at the level of atomic change. \nX-ray crystallography had long been the go-to method for chemists and biologists seeking to understand the structure of proteins. It has helped scientists win more than a dozen Nobel Prizes, including the 1962 award for revealing DNA\u2019s double helix, according to a news article in Nature , and by 2015 x-rays had been used to determine the structure of about 90 percent of the approximately 100,000 molecules in the popular Protein Data Bank. \nBut the technique cannot do everything. As its name implies, crystallography requires its targets to be made into crystals. And with many large, complicated molecules found in and around cells\u2014uch as ribosomes, which turn genetic instructions into working proteins\u2014scientists simply could not make that happen. \nElectrons, however, can bounce off every atom in a protein and reveal its structure. That structure is three dimensional, and beginning in the 1970s Frank developed a mathematical image-processing method that allowed a computer to merge several two-dimensional electron microscope images into a sharp 3-D picture. Dubochet\u2019s contribution was to show how this kind of microscopy could be used on biomolecules. Molecules such as proteins are surrounded by water that helps them maintain their structures, but electron microscopy dried up the water. Dubochet figured out a way to cool the water rapidly so it became like glass\u2014the form is called vitrified water\u2014and allowed the molecules within to retain their shapes. \nThen in 1990, after 15 years\u2019 work refining sample preparation and electron detection, Henderson succeeded in using an electron microscope to create an image of a large bacterial cell membrane protein called bacteriorhodopsin, and do it at atomic resolution. Henderson, with Nigel Unwin, wrote in Scientific American\u2019s February 1984 issue about how the two pioneered the use of electron microscopes to see the details of cell membrane proteins. \nNow for any scientist \u201cwho is interested in a protein\u2019s structure and function\u2014well, I\u2019d love to have one of these in my laboratory,\u201d Campbell says. Dubochet, Frank, and Henderson will get their medals and each a third of the 9 million Swedish krona (about $1.1 million) prize at the annual Nobel ceremony in Stockholm in December.

The cut was shallow, but drew blood. As a science journalist and author of The Man Who Couldn't Stop: OCD and the True Story of a Life Lost in Thought , a book about his own struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder, Adam had a good idea of what was in store. His OCD involved an obsessive fear of contracting HIV and produced a set of compulsive behaviors revolving around blood. \nIn this instance he hurried home to get some tissue and returned to check there was not already any blood on the barbed-wire. \u201cI looked and saw there was no blood on the tissue, looked underneath the fence, saw there was no blood, turned to walk away, and had to do it all again, and again and again,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get stuck in this horrific cycle, where all the evidence you use to form judgments in everyday life tells you there\u2019s no blood. And if anyone asked, you\u2019d say \u2018no.\u2019 Yet, when you ask yourself, you say \u2018maybe.\u2019\u201d \nSuch compulsive behaviors, and the obsessions to which they are typically linked are what define OCD. Far from merely excessive tidiness, the mental disorder can have a devastating impact on a person\u2019s life. Adam's story illustrates a curious feature of the condition. Sufferers are usually well aware their behavior is irrational but cannot stop themselves from doing whatever it is they feel compelled to do. \nA new study published September 28 in Neuron uses mathematical modeling of decision-making during a simple game to provide insight into what might be going on. The game looked at a critical aspect of the way we perceive the world. Normally, a person's confidence about their knowledge of the surrounding environment guides their actions. \u201cIf I think it\u2019s going to rain, I'm going to take an umbrella,\u201d says lead author Matilde Vaghi. The study shows this link between belief and action is broken to some extent in people with OCD. As a consequence, what they do conflicts with what they know. This insight suggests compulsive behaviors are a core feature rather than merely a consequence of obsessions or a result of inaccurate beliefs. \nThe research of Vaghi and colleagues demonstrates the type of research being performed by the relatively new field of computational psychiatry. The work could ultimately lead to tools for early detection of people at risk. The field also may help pave the way for improved diagnosis based on understanding the biological or cognitive mechanisms of mental disorders rather than merely observing symptoms, as psychiatrists currently do. A more mechanistic analysis might also reveal that a tendency to repeat inappropriate actions (a compulsivity \u201ctrait\u201d) is shared among multiple disorders such as OCD, substance abuse and eating disorders. And this type of analysis might distinguish among different types of OCDs and give psychiatrists a better idea about who might respond best to particular treatments. \nIn principle, the fact that beliefs and actions in OCD patients are often at odds could have several explanations. It is possible their ability to learn about the environment might be impaired in some way or they might lack confidence in things learned, despite their being accurate. Inspired by these questions, Vaghi and colleagues decided to investigate the relationship between belief and action during learning in people with and without OCD with the goal of discerning that connection\u2014and what may go awry in OCD. The team\u2014led by graduate students Vaghi and Fabrice Luyckx at the University of Cambridge, and neuroeconomist and senior author Benedetto De Martino at University College London\u2014used an established task to study how beliefs and actions evolve over time during learning. They recruited 24 volunteers with OCD and 25 people without the disorder and had them play a video game in which they had to move a target (the \u201cbucket\u201d) around a circle to catch colored dots (\u201ccoins\u201d) emitted from the center of the circle. The participants had to move the bucket to a position they thought most likely to catch the next coin, and give a rating as a percentage of how confident they were of the choice they had made. Most of the time the average destination of the coins was more or less the same, varying only slightly, but there was a one-in-eight chance each time that this position would dramatically shift. The game they played. Credit: Vaghi and Luyckx et al., EurekAlert \nThe groups did not differ as far as how many coins were caught, but people with OCD tended to move the bucket toward exactly where the last coin landed more than healthy volunteers did. The actions of healthy participants closely mirrored the predictions of a mathematical model of learning whereas the actions of people with OCD deviated substantially from these predictions. Instead, the OCD group overreacted to what neuroscientists call \u201cprediction error,\u201d which in this case is the difference between where they placed the middle of the bucket and where the coin actually made contact with the circle. The healthy volunteers paid less attention to these errors unless a big shift took place in the average direction of the coin. The control group, instead, made a mental calculation concerning the average direction of the coin over the preceding trials. As a consequence, they tended to move the bucket less. \nCrucially, though, confidence ratings (which dropped sharply after a shift, then rose as evidence of the new average direction accumulated) were indistinguishable between the two groups, suggesting the patients developed as accurate a sense of what was going on as the healthy volunteers. But their actual bucket placements showed they were not using this knowledge to guide their actions. \u201cThis study shows that [in OCD] actions are dissociated from thoughts, in a sense,\u201d Vaghi says. \u201cIt's very much related to the clinical manifestation, when [sufferers] say: \u201cI know it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019m going to get contaminated by touching the door handle, but even so, I will wash my hands.\u2019\u201d \nThe team also found that the extent to which confidence and action were uncoupled tended to be greater in individuals with more severe symptoms. \u201cThe new, exciting thing is the finding of a dissociation between action and belief in OCD that seems critical in this disorder,\u201d De Martino says. \u201cWe found a clear correlation between the degree of this dissociation and the severity of symptoms.\u201d These results suggest compulsive behaviors are a core feature of OCD rather than just a response to specific obsessions (washing to relieve anxiety about contamination, for instance). \u201cThe orthodox story is it\u2019s all grounded in the obsessions; these drive anxiety and people take compulsive actions to alleviate that,\u201d says computational neuroscientist Nathaniel Daw of Princeton University, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThis study supports the alternative idea that the compulsions themselves are a core deficit, not secondary to obsessions.\u201d \nDe Martino is interested in the mechanisms underlying decision-making in general, and specifically the relationship between confidence and action. These are normally so tightly tied together, it is difficult to study their relationship. But the team saw that OCD might provide a natural way of disentangling them. A standard view is that confidence is calculated by monitoring our actions; think about how much longer you take to act in uncertain situations. \u201cThis is roughly the idea of monitoring your own behavior to build confidence estimates, but this is not the only architecture the brain could use,\u201d De Martino says. If confidence is estimated by monitoring behavior, it should be impossible to separate confidence from actions. But it is also possible that confidence is calculated independently (or \u201coffline\u201d) and can then be used both for guiding action and reporting confidence levels\u2014a form of processing known as a \u201cparallel\u201d architecture. The second alternative \u201cis exactly what our data suggest,\u201d De Martino says. \u201cThis is the general appeal of this work beyond the specific clinical interest; these patients can help us distinguish between alternative cognitive architectures.\u201d \nThe results suggest the brain calculates confidence independently of action but healthy functioning depends on linking them tightly together. They are also consistent with a \u201cdual-systems\u201d view of behavioral control that distinguishes between explicit, conscious reasoning and more implicit, automatic behaviors, Daw says. \u201cA number of issues in psychiatry related to compulsion have to do with a disconnect, or imbalance, between these two types of process,\u201d \nA major caveat is the study was a snapshot in time, of people who were already ill, and so cannot settle questions of cause and effect. \u201cWe don't know if this impairment results from illness or caused it,\u201d Daw says. Figuring out how a general impairment like this relates to patients\u2019 specific obsessions and compulsions will require studies of people with OCD over long periods to see how different aspects of the disorder evolve over time. But if the uncoupling of actions from beliefs is at the root of OCD, it represents a common disease mechanism that potentially unites a wide range of patients with quite different observable symptoms. \u201cThe hope is that by understanding the general mechanism, rather than focusing on specific symptoms, we can guide new therapies,\u201d De Martino says. One implication of the current findings is that if compulsive behavior is at the core of the disorder, treatments directly aimed at modifying behavior (like cognitive behavioral therapy) may be more effective than treatments more tailored to obsessive, rumination-style thinking, Vaghi says. \nThe team next plans to investigate where the mechanism behind this impairment is located in the brain. Researchers already know connections between parts of the frontal cortex, which orchestrates higher functions like planning and problem-solving, and deeper areas, including a region called the ventral striatum, are abnormal inOCD. Further, prediction errors, which are what seemed to determine patients' abnormal actions, are primarily processed in the ventral striatum. These findings suggest circuits between the frontal and striatal areas may be the critical ones underlying this dysfunction. Brain imaging people with OCD doing this kind of task should help solidify this hypothesis. \u201cMental disorders are brain disorders,\u201d Vaghi says \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of stigma because we think psychiatric patients are crazy and making things up whereas we wouldn\u2019t dare say a person with cancer is inventing it,\u201d she adds. \u201cLinking these kinds of behavior to brain mechanisms should help.\u201d \nThe study illustrates the potential of computational psychiatry, Vaghi says. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of how integrating computational and clinical aspects is a really powerful approach,\u201d she adds. \u201cWithout computational modeling we wouldn't have been able to pin down exactly what this behavior relates to\u2014we were able to understand which component of the model explains the behavior.\u201d ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S) Simon Makin Simon J.

The participants had to move the bucket to a position they thought most likely to catch the next coin, and give a rating as a percentage of how confident they were of the choice they had made. Most of the time the average destination of the coins was more or less the same, varying only slightly, but there was a one-in-eight chance each time that this position would dramatically shift. The game they played. Credit: Vaghi and Luyckx et al., EurekAlert \nThe groups did not differ as far as how many coins were caught, but people with OCD tended to move the bucket toward exactly where the last coin landed more than healthy volunteers did. The actions of healthy participants closely mirrored the predictions of a mathematical model of learning whereas the actions of people with OCD deviated substantially from these predictions. Instead, the OCD group overreacted to what neuroscientists call \u201cprediction error,\u201d which in this case is the difference between where they placed the middle of the bucket and where the coin actually made contact with the circle. The healthy volunteers paid less attention to these errors unless a big shift took place in the average direction of the coin. The control group, instead, made a mental calculation concerning the average direction of the coin over the preceding trials. As a consequence, they tended to move the bucket less. \nCrucially, though, confidence ratings (which dropped sharply after a shift, then rose as evidence of the new average direction accumulated) were indistinguishable between the two groups, suggesting the patients developed as accurate a sense of what was going on as the healthy volunteers. But their actual bucket placements showed they were not using this knowledge to guide their actions. \u201cThis study shows that [in OCD] actions are dissociated from thoughts, in a sense,\u201d Vaghi says. \u201cIt's very much related to the clinical manifestation, when [sufferers] say: \u201cI know it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019m going to get contaminated by touching the door handle, but even so, I will wash my hands.\u2019\u201d \nThe team also found that the extent to which confidence and action were uncoupled tended to be greater in individuals with more severe symptoms. \u201cThe new, exciting thing is the finding of a dissociation between action and belief in OCD that seems critical in this disorder,\u201d De Martino says. \u201cWe found a clear correlation between the degree of this dissociation and the severity of symptoms.\u201d These results suggest compulsive behaviors are a core feature of OCD rather than just a response to specific obsessions (washing to relieve anxiety about contamination, for instance). \u201cThe orthodox story is it\u2019s all grounded in the obsessions; these drive anxiety and people take compulsive actions to alleviate that,\u201d says computational neuroscientist Nathaniel Daw of Princeton University, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThis study supports the alternative idea that the compulsions themselves are a core deficit, not secondary to obsessions.\u201d \nDe Martino is interested in the mechanisms underlying decision-making in general, and specifically the relationship between confidence and action. These are normally so tightly tied together, it is difficult to study their relationship. But the team saw that OCD might provide a natural way of disentangling them. A standard view is that confidence is calculated by monitoring our actions; think about how much longer you take to act in uncertain situations. \u201cThis is roughly the idea of monitoring your own behavior to build confidence estimates, but this is not the only architecture the brain could use,\u201d De Martino says. If confidence is estimated by monitoring behavior, it should be impossible to separate confidence from actions. But it is also possible that confidence is calculated independently (or \u201coffline\u201d) and can then be used both for guiding action and reporting confidence levels\u2014a form of processing known as a \u201cparallel\u201d architecture. The second alternative \u201cis exactly what our data suggest,\u201d De Martino says. \u201cThis is the general appeal of this work beyond the specific clinical interest; these patients can help us distinguish between alternative cognitive architectures.\u201d \nThe results suggest the brain calculates confidence independently of action but healthy functioning depends on linking them tightly together. They are also consistent with a \u201cdual-systems\u201d view of behavioral control that distinguishes between explicit, conscious reasoning and more implicit, automatic behaviors, Daw says. \u201cA number of issues in psychiatry related to compulsion have to do with a disconnect, or imbalance, between these two types of process,\u201d \nA major caveat is the study was a snapshot in time, of people who were already ill, and so cannot settle questions of cause and effect. \u201cWe don't know if this impairment results from illness or caused it,\u201d Daw says. Figuring out how a general impairment like this relates to patients\u2019 specific obsessions and compulsions will require studies of people with OCD over long periods to see how different aspects of the disorder evolve over time. But if the uncoupling of actions from beliefs is at the root of OCD, it represents a common disease mechanism that potentially unites a wide range of patients with quite different observable symptoms. \u201cThe hope is that by understanding the general mechanism, rather than focusing on specific symptoms, we can guide new therapies,\u201d De Martino says. One implication of the current findings is that if compulsive behavior is at the core of the disorder, treatments directly aimed at modifying behavior (like cognitive behavioral therapy) may be more effective than treatments more tailored to obsessive, rumination-style thinking, Vaghi says. \nThe team next plans to investigate where the mechanism behind this impairment is located in the brain. Researchers already know connections between parts of the frontal cortex, which orchestrates higher functions like planning and problem-solving, and deeper areas, including a region called the ventral striatum, are abnormal inOCD. Further, prediction errors, which are what seemed to determine patients' abnormal actions, are primarily processed in the ventral striatum. These findings suggest circuits between the frontal and striatal areas may be the critical ones underlying this dysfunction. Brain imaging people with OCD doing this kind of task should help solidify this hypothesis. \u201cMental disorders are brain disorders,\u201d Vaghi says \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of stigma because we think psychiatric patients are crazy and making things up whereas we wouldn\u2019t dare say a person with cancer is inventing it,\u201d she adds. \u201cLinking these kinds of behavior to brain mechanisms should help.\u201d \nThe study illustrates the potential of computational psychiatry, Vaghi says. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of how integrating computational and clinical aspects is a really powerful approach,\u201d she adds. \u201cWithout computational modeling we wouldn't have been able to pin down exactly what this behavior relates to\u2014we were able to understand which component of the model explains the behavior.\u201d ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S) Simon Makin Simon J.

Like nature itself, the well-choreographed and publicized set of rituals surrounding the prize comes complete with its own distinct seasons: the season of \u201crevelation,\u201d experienced this week, and the season of \u201ccoronation\u201d\u2014the awards ceremony, held annually on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel\u2019s death. \nBut there is a lesser-known Nobel season as well: the season of \u201cnomination,\u201d an epoch which closes in the dead of winter, at midnight in Stockholm on January 31 each year . This marks the date by which nominators must submit their Nobel Prize nominations. There is no grace period; it is never postponed, and there is no allowance for nominators who tarry. \nThis can have problematic consequences. In 2009, for example, President Barack Obama had been on the job for only 11 days when nomination season ended. Some said he hadn\u2019t even had time to measure the proverbial drapes in the Oval Office, let alone to have reduced \u201cthe world\u2019s standing armies\u201d\u2014the criterion Nobel\u2019s will stipulated for the Peace prize. But he won the Peace Prize that year nevertheless. His nomination was perfectly in line with the Prize committee\u2019s technical requirements; it had beaten the deadline. \nThe January deadline came into play with a twinge of sadness this week as the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics was announced. The press release issued by the Nobel Prize committee states that Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Barry Barish were rewarded \"for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.\u201d It goes on to say that \u201cOn 14 September 2015, the universe's gravitational waves were observed for the very first time. The waves, which were predicted by Albert Einstein a hundred years ago, came from a collision between two black holes.\u201d While the waves, traveling at lightspeed, took 1.3 billion years to reach LIGO\u2019s twin detectors, it was the far briefer span of two weeks that fundamentally altered the calculus of this year\u2019s prize. \nLIGO\u2019s detectors had fortuitously come online only weeks before catching the first gravitational wave signals on that fateful September day. After months of painstaking analysis by more than 1,000 members of the consortium, the team was finally ready to go forward and make their announcement public, which they did on 11 February 2016. Whispers of a Nobel began immediately, and eight months later, as Nobel revelation season approached, those whispers intensified. \nWriting in Science in October 2016, Adrian Cho\u2014unaware LIGO\u2019s February announcement had missed the nomination deadline\u2014said \u201cNext week, the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics will be announced, and many scientists expect it to honor the detection of ripples in space called gravitational waves, reported in February. If other prizes are a guide, the Nobel will go to the troika of physicists who 32 years ago conceived of LIGO, the duo of giant detectors responsible for the discovery: Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, and Ronald Drever and Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. But some influential physicists, including previous Nobel laureates, say the prize, which can be split three ways at most, should include somebody else: Barry Barish.\u201d \nAt the time, Barish, who this week shared one-quarter of the 2017 prize for his decisive role in LIGO, agreed that Weiss, Drever, and Thorne deserved science\u2019s highest accolade. Yet, evidently equally unaware of the January 31 nomination deadline, he added a note regarding the due diligence of the committee: \u201cIf they wait a year and give it to these three guys, at least I\u2019ll feel that they thought about it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they decide [to give it to them] this October, I\u2019ll have more bad feelings because they won\u2019t have done their homework.\u201d \nBut if the committee had recognized the LIGO discovery that year, why couldn\u2019t Barish have been included as well. Why a trio and not a quartet? This restriction comes from a stipulation that a maximum of three scientists can share a prize\u2014a rule added by the Nobel committee years after the awards were established in Alfred Nobel\u2019s will . In fact, the will requires that the prizes be given to \u201cthe person\u2026\u201d\u2014that\u2019s \u201cperson,\u201d in the singular\u2014whose discovery or invention has provided \u201cthe greatest benefit to mankind.\u201d The committee jettisoned that requirement 1902, the prize\u2019s second year, according to science historian Elizabeth Crawford in her book The Beginnings of the Nobel Institution: The Science Prizes, 1901-1915 . \nHad LIGO beaten the 31 January 2016 deadline, even Barish seemed to agree that he might have been justifiably lost a share of last year\u2019s Nobel Prize due to the \u201crule of three.\u201d Early this year, the same headaches seemed likely for the 2017 Nobel Prize committee\u2014how to choose three of the four? \nSadly, in March 2017, their dilemma was resolved. The death of Ron Drever permanently eliminated him from Nobel consideration thanks to the Nobel Foundation\u2019s statutes , which forbid posthumous awards. The posthumous stipulation, however, like the restriction to a maximum of three winners is not found anywhere in Alfred\u2019s will. It was enacted 73 years after the first prizes. \nWhile most see the Nobel Prizes as an inspirational celebration of the human mind\u2014the one chance for basic science to share the spotlight on a par with Hollywood celebrities, for at least a week\u2014others feel it has some detrimental effects on the portrayal of science. The Astronomer Royal, Sir Martin Rees, said this week that the three new laureates were \"outstanding individuals whose contributions were distinctive and complementary.\u201d But he also added: \"Of course LIGO\u2019s success was owed to literally hundreds of dedicated scientists and engineers. The fact that the Nobel committee refuses to make group awards is causing them increasingly frequent problems\u2014and giving a misleading and unfair impression of how a lot of science is actually done.\" \nWorse yet, younger scientists, are becoming disillusioned by the lack of racial and gender diversity of the winners. Some, like Matthew Francis , say it might be time to retire the Nobels entirely, saying that they are \u201cnot an adequate reflection of real science, and they reinforce the worst aspects of the culture of science\u2026.Maybe we should dump 'em and start over.\" \nThere have long been calls for Nobel Prize reform . Many are dismayed when scientists treat the rules of the Nobel Prize as inviolable as laws of nature itself. These voices, like distant signals from in-spiraling black holes, may prove too loud for the Nobel committees to continue to ignore. After all, we are living in a populist era where long-held traditions and institutions are coming under intense scrutiny. Some institutions are responding with reform, others remain steadfast, committed to maintaining their outdated rules. \nNo one questions the appropriateness of this weeks\u2019 winners. Yet it is impossible to disregard how the Nobel committee solved one problem\u2014forbidding awards to more than three winners\u2014by virtue of another arbitrary prohibition: the one that forbids posthumous prizes. In an era increasingly concerned with transparency and fairness, it will be hard not to heed the clarion calls for substantive reform. \nInstead of boycott or retirement, modest reforms should take place. One proposal would be to give the first Nobel Prize in physics intentionally awarded posthumously to Vera Rubin for her indisputable discovery of dark matter. \nImagine the statement that would make! \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Credit: ullstein bild Dtl. Getty Images Advertisement \nThere may actually have been three Sputnik moments. \nThe Soviet Union's Oct. 4, 1957, launch of the first-ever artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 , created quite a stir, to be sure. It did kick off the space age, after all. \nBut Americans' concerns about the technological capabilities of their own nation relative to those of the USSR didn't fully bloom until two months later, after the Soviets had launched a dog to space and the United States' first attempt to loft a satellite had failed spectacularly, said former NASA Chief Historian Roger Launius. [ Sputnik 1! 7 Fun Facts About Humanity's First Satellite ] \n\"The way I tend to phrase it is, you get three strikes, and you're out,\" Launius told Space.com. No panic in the streets \nThe launch of the beach-ball-size Sputnik 1 did not come as a shock to American national-security officials, who had expected something big was in the works. But it did catch the public off-guard, Launius said. \nStill, the nation was not overcome by panic or worry, stressed Launius, who until recently served as associate director of collections and curatorial affairs for the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. (He is now retired.) \n\"It wasn't that everybody was running around with their hair on fire,\" Launius said. \"They're not afraid of this. It's sort of, a new age has dawned \u2014 this is exciting.\" \nHe pointed to a standard, previously scheduled news conference held by President Dwight Eisenhower the week after the launch. \n\"The media at the time asked him a couple of questions about Sputnik, and then they moved on to other things,\" Launius said. \"The big story of the day was the Little Rock crisis \u2014 are you going to bring in federal troops to desegregate the Little Rock [Arkansas] school system?\" Two more strikes \nBut the mood shifted noticeably on Nov. 3, 1957, when the USSR successfully launched Sputnik 2 to orbit, Launius said. \nThis satellite was not only much larger than its predecessor \u2014 Sputnik 2 weighed 1,120 lbs. (508 kilograms), compared with 184 lbs. (83 kg) for Sputnik 1 \u2014 it also toted the first-ever living creature to space, a dog named Laika. (The poor pup died of overheating inside its capsule a few hours after launch.) \nAnd then came strike three. On Dec. 6, 1957, the United States tried to loft its first satellite, a 3.5-lb. (1.6 kg) craft called Vanguard Test Vehicle 3. The satellite's rocket exploded just after liftoff in a spectacular failure shown live on national TV. \n\"People are concerned at that point, and justifiably so,\" Launius said. \"It looks like the Soviets could do nothing wrong, and the Americans could do nothing right.\" \nThis concern was not merely a consequence of wounded national pride. \n\"The public feared that the Soviets' ability to launch satellites also translated into the capability to launch ballistic missiles that could carry nuclear weapons from Europe to the U.S.,\" NASA historians wrote in 2007 in a piece marking the 50th anniversary of Sputnik 1's launch. Bouncing back \nThe United States soon joined the Soviet Union as a spacefaring nation, launching the Explorer 1 satellite on Jan. 31, 1958. \n\"It certainly salved the open wound; there's no doubt about that,\" Launius said of Explorer 1, which famously discovered the Van Allen radiation belts surrounding Earth. \nBut this success didn't erase all memories of the wound. Over time, the three-tiered Sputnik moment spurred the U.S. government to ramp up the nation's technological capabilities, Launius said. \nFor example, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (which was later renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA) was created in February 1958. In September of that year, Congress enacted the National Defense Education Act, which was designed to boost the number and quality of American scientists and engineers. And NASA began operations shortly thereafter, on Oct. 1, 1958. \nDespite such measures, the Soviet Union notched the next big space-race milestone, ushering in the age of human spaceflight by launching Yuri Gagarin to orbit on April 12, 1961. By the end of the decade, however, the United States had claimed perhaps the biggest prize: landing astronauts on the moon and returning them safely to Earth. \nFollow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+ .

In a city otherwise riven by partisan battles, the commission\u2019s work is good news and deserves attention. It\u2019s the brainchild of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R\u2013Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D\u2013Wash.). The premise is simple: Federal government data can help produce better informed decisions. \u201cFor example, according to the report , \u201c access to administrative data has improved federal investment in workforce training by making possible comparisons in changes in quarterly earnings between different training and employment programs.\u201d \nThere are some caveats, though. Much of the information in question is personal data, and there are real privacy concerns when particulars about people are combined across federal agencies. That could lead to secretive profiling and unfair and unaccountable decision-making. In fact, a proposal in the mid-1960s to create a national data center\u2014also to ensure better policy-making by the federal government\u2014produced such a backlash that Congress enacted comprehensive legislation to limit federal agencies\u2019 ability to gather and collect personal information. \nIn passing the 1974 Privacy Act Congress recognized that statistical data, such as the U.S. census, can help inform government policy while minimizing privacy risks. And so, the same law that limits use of personal data recognizes the critical role of statistical information to promote smart government. \nOver time technology has chipped away at the ability to separate statistical from personal data. The use of microdata, new techniques for \u201creidentifying\u201d people whose data had supposedly been made anonymous, commercial incentives and even criminal hacking could foil even the best attempts to prevent individuals from being identified. The commission urged the adoption of privacy enhancement and preservation techniques\u2014such as the use of differential privacy algorithms that glean information from a person\u2019s data without identifying that person\u2014to minimize privacy risks. It also recommended the creation of a national secure data service to manage multisource data projects without creating a centralized repository. And in a related report the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has stated that agencies must be responsible for ensuring that privacy techniques work as advertised. \nStill, the larger goal of promoting better use of government data is laudable. Remarkably, in the privacy field some of the most sensitive data in government is made available to the public. For almost 50 years the Administrative Office of the United States Courts has provided detailed reports on the use of surveillance authority in the U.S. Those reports document the use of wiretapping by the federal government\u2014its frequency, cost, reasons for use (most wiretaps concern drug investigations not terrorism) and effectiveness. The data makes possible meaningful oversight of law enforcement activities. And even when law enforcement agencies and civil liberties advocates debate the scope of government surveillance, there is a common data set that informs the discussion. Remarkably, the data is made available without compromising investigations or revealing the names of individuals \nOf course, a lot of the data collected by federal agencies does not threaten privacy at all. Consider the important work of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its recent tracking of hurricanes across the Atlantic Ocean. Meteorological data is becoming increasingly important as the severity of storms increases. State and local officials need the best information possible to make difficult decisions about how to deploy resources and when to evacuate residents of coastal communities. Our ability to forecast storms has improved dramatically from 1900, when a hurricane\u2014which still ranks as the most deadly natural disaster in our nation\u2019s history\u2014took the lives of approximately 10,000 people in Galveston, Texas. The reason for the high death toll was the lack of accurate forecasting and therefore the lack of preparation. But there is more to do. \nEven today, U.S. hurricane forecasting lags others. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) model is now considered the premier global model in the world. And so, U.S. weather forecasters often superimpose the ECMWF tracks when discussing recent storm activity in the U.S. The U.S. needs to do better, and data in the federal government is a good starting point. \nWith the report on Evidence-Based Policymaking completed, the work of the commission will now be transferred to the Bipartisan Policy Center . That is also a hopeful sign. The formulation of evidence-based policies should remain a priority, regardless of party affiliation. \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

For all that technology has to offer, in our knowledge-based global economy a company's primary assets are still its employees. It's concerning\u2014and somewhat of a red flag\u2014when employees quit in succession. Why does the departure of a key team member serve as the catalyst for turnover? While there are a number of reasons why employees may decide to leave an organization, including job satisfaction and organizational and economic market factors, an often overlooked reason may be their coworkers. When a group of employees leave an organization in a rapid cycle, it may be due to the influence of their immediate peer group. \nThere are psychological (micro) and organizational/economic (macro) reasons for employee turnover. Macro reasons are generally more systemic. For example, industries that are high stress, low reward tend to be more prone to turnover. In addition, market factors such as the availability of alternative employment opportunities can determine if people leave or stay. Micro reasons are more individual. They are often related to the degree of job satisfaction and organizational commitment held by the employee. Job satisfaction is a combination of pay satisfaction, social integration, peer and managerial communication, role overload, opportunities for growth, general training opportunities, supervisor support, coworker support, and distributive justice. Organizational commitment is measured by job embeddedness, which is like a net or a web. A highly embedded employee has many links or connections\u2014essentially a more tightly woven net\u2014within the organization. Embeddedness is characterized by the extent to which people have links to other people or activities, and the degree to which their jobs and communities are similar to and fit with the other aspects in their life. An employee\u2019s organizational commitment forecasts the ease with which these links can be broken. \nIn general, employees who are less satisfied and less committed are more likely to think abut leaving, are more likely to be willing to look for alternative jobs, are more likely to quit, and will do all of these things to a greater degree if they believe that desirable employment alternatives exist for them. Job satisfaction is a variable thing. Given the same employment circumstances between two people, one may be more satisfied than the other when personal and lifestyle factors are taken into account. Job satisfaction can also be called into question if employees perceive others who are similarly skilled or otherwise considered influential are questioning their organizational commitment. These factors can also be exacerbated when people begin to compare themselves to others and perceive favoritism from managers or believe that they are not being appropriately recognized for their efforts. This comparison is a pervasive tendency; we use the status of others to measure ourselves and determine if we're attaining prescribed social milestones at the established normative rate. So if it is known that some colleagues are actively looking for other jobs, it can make leaving seem like a viable option for someone who might be wavering or on the fence about staying. If job hunting occurs within a team, especially if that team is a close one, it can cause other members of the team to question whether they should be doing the same. These doubts can be raised by both direct and indirect methods, meaning it can be prompted if a colleague explicitly states that she has a job interview or if job hunting behaviors (e.g., perusing job sites, updating a resume) are witnessed by others. \nThe idea that assessing job satisfaction and organizational commitment between colleagues can be a determinant of quitting is known as turnover contagion. It appears to be more common when coworkers around the departing employee are not embedded in their jobs. If we view embeddedness as the links that an employee has to others and to the organization, embeddedness can tell us how well the employee fits within her peer group or team (e.g., do they have the skills to get their tasks done well, do they get along with their peers, is their relationship complementary?) A highly embedded employee will believe that she is a good fit within the organization and has the tools and skills to get her tasks done, whereas a low embedded employee will not. For a highly embedded employee, the prospect of leaving the relationships she has established can act as a deterrent. Focus group discussions support the hypothesis that job embeddedness is negatively related to voluntary turnover. Research shows employees with low embeddedness are more likely to make comments about leaving, particularly noting that former colleagues were able to get more pay, better opportunities or benefits, move into roles that were less physically demanding or go back to school after they left. For example, one participant commented that \u201cAt [alternative] company, the pay starts at $9 or $10 and they reimburse 100% of tuition. If I saw that they were hiring, I could see myself leaving.\u201d When turnover is perceived as the norm, it also invites more open commentary reflecting embeddedness\u2014employees are more likely to talk openly about possibly leaving. This openness feeds the comparison between colleagues and makes people more likely to participate in job search activities because they believe their colleagues are doing the same. \nThe effect of the turnover contagion is particularly pronounced in smaller team groups that are self-contained. These employees have a greater impact on each other as they interact more closely with each other and have greater opportunities to observe and assess each other\u2019s behaviors and interactions with management. In fact, turnover tendencies were mitigated in company settings where employees had broader interactions with colleagues beyond their immediate teams and departments. \nFor employers looking to increase retention, this research shouldn\u2019t suggest that a surveillance state is necessary or that teams should be regularly divided or that random, superfluous perks will offset turnover. At the heart of embeddedness and job satisfaction are very personal, very individual issues concerning recognition (of both skills and needs), growth and support, and equitable relationships. Leaving a job is not a decision that is made easily in many cases. What this research suggests is that turnover may be prompted by unaddressed departures of key personnel, which can trigger an assessment of self (i.e., \"Is this job going to help me attain the goals I have?\", \"Can I afford to leave this job?\" and \"Can I afford to stay?\", \"Am I satisfied and rate of growth here?\"). Older employees, those who are married, those who have children or have other caregiving responsibilities, or simply those who are carrying debt may be more likely to stay than leave despite turnover prompts. A new job means starting fresh and giving up tenure and credibility with colleagues as well as earned benefits. It's a serious decision. A demonstration of investment in employees can go a long way toward mitigating turnover contagion: providing training and growth opportunities, giving managers the tools to better support and direct reports, and maintaining a culture of clear, open, and direct communication can help build embeddedness. \nSocial forces and social assessments will always be present; they're a driving force in maintaining social norms. Social comparisons can absolutely make quitting contagious. This in turn can also devastate a company from a service delivery and reputation standpoint. The failure of organizations to see employees as individuals with specific needs will impact turnover. Granted, in a 500 person organization, the CEO may not know every person under the corporate banner, but they can empower managers to better serve the people they are responsible for by responding to specific needs on a case by case basis. This is not an invitation for the mass renegotiation of contracts but an understanding that job satisfaction and embeddedness can fluctuate. And if previously high performing employees are suddenly withdrawn, it may be worth a deeper look. \nThe workforce is increasingly moving toward greater flexibility, partly in recognition of the needs and obligations and responsibilities employees may need to satisfy during traditional working hours but also because technology now makes it possible to make allowances in work locations and work hours. Ultimately, when a key employee leaves and it seems that others may be queuing to also leave as a result--and this loss is evaluated as being detrimental to the workplace overall--it's an opportunity for the organization to evaluate the relationship it has with its employees and judge whether it believes it is providing the opportunities its employees need to help the company attain its business objectives. \nComments have been disabled on Anthropology in Practice, but you can always join the community on Facebook . \n-- \nReferenced \nFelps, Will, Terence Mitchell, David Herman, Thomas Lee, Brooks Holtom and Wendy Harman (2009). \"Turnover Contagion: How Coworkers'Job Embeddedness and Job Search Behaviors,\" The Academy of Management Journal Vol. 52(3): 545-561. \nMitchell, Terence, Brooks Holtom, Thomas Lee, Chris Sablynski and Miriam Erez (2001). \"Why People Stay: Using Job Embeddedness to Predict Voluntary Turnover,\" The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 44(6): 1102-1121. \n--", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david herman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terence mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris sablynski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooks holtom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miriam erez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wendy harman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "workplace anthropology", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "academy of management journal vol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "academy of management journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T20:00:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a12a542695b24b15f201ea8eac8f391eb210e033", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnJIuVznIf8131dHfMLIfv1gpkpCjWfsopEyTgEaDAC00R02GDettHhXPfSlZ4hZa7fabDIAldksda5hTCx3xfAo-", "site_full": "www.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "http://www.scientificamerican.com", "site_categories": ["news", "education"], "section_title": "Scientific American Content: Global", "title": "Construction of Thirty Meter Telescope Gets Go-Ahead", "title_full": "Construction of Thirty Meter Telescope Gets Go-Ahead", "published": "2017-10-04T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a12a542695b24b15f201ea8eac8f391eb210e033", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnJIuVznIf8131dHfMLIfv1gpkpCjWfsopEyTgEaDAC00R02GDettHhXPfSlZ4hZa7fabDIAldksda5hTCx3xfAo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike Wall", "published": "2017-10-04T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Construction of Thirty Meter Telescope Gets Go-Ahead", "text": "Print Share via An artist\u2019s rendition of the Thirty Meter Telescope, planned for construction atop the Hawaiian mountain of Mauna Kea. Credit: TMT Observatory Corporation Advertisement \nA $1.4 billion telescope project has finally gotten the go-ahead to resume construction high up on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano. \nThe state's Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) announced Friday (Sept. 29) that it has decided to approve a construction permit for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), which has been in limbo for several years. \nTMT broke ground in October 2014, but demonstrations the following spring halted the build. Protesters have cited concerns about the telescope project's cultural and environmental impact; Native Hawaiians regard peaks throughout the island chain as sacred. [ Thirty Meter Telescope: Hawaii's Giant Space Eye (Gallery) ] \nThen, in December 2015, the Hawaii Supreme Court pulled TMT's original construction permit indefinitely , saying the BLNR granted it without properly addressing a petition filed by opposition groups. And in December 2016, a judge with Hawaii's Third Circuit Court ruled that a sublease agreement between TMT and the University of Hawaii was invalid because the BLNR allowed it without holding a \"contested case hearing.\" \nAs this history suggests, a favorable ruling by the BLNR does not guarantee smooth sailing into the future for TMT. Indeed, opponents of Friday's decision are already planning to appeal it to the Hawaii Supreme Court, Sky & Telescope noted . \nIf building on Mauna Kea becomes impossible or impractical, the project could relocate to its backup site \u2014the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos on La Palma, in the Canary Islands. \nTMT will integrate 492 mirror segments into a single light-gathering surface 98 feet (30 meters) wide. When it's operational in the early to mid-2020s, the giant scope will be put to a variety of uses, from detecting and characterizing exoplanets to studying mysterious dark matter and dark energy, project representatives have said. \nTMT is one of three ground-based megascopes scheduled to come online in the 2020s. The others\u2014the Giant Magellan Telescope and the European Extremely Large Telescope \u2014 are both being built in the Chilean Andes.

Credit: NASA, JPL-Caltech Advertisement \nIn stories about the universe gravity plays a starring role. It is the force that best explains not only the motions of the planets, stars and galaxies, but also their origins and evolution\u2014how order coalesced from the chaos of the primordial cosmos. \nYet for all of gravity\u2019s importance, physicists\u2019 understanding of it is in many respects woefully incomplete. After famously watching an apple fall from a tree, Isaac Newton recognized gravity as a fundamental force acting on all things, yet he failed to explain its origins. Centuries later Albert Einstein would explain the phenomenon as a distortion of the fabric of reality itself, a view perhaps best summarized later by the physicist John Wheeler: \u201cSpacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\u201d Like Newton\u2019s definition, Einstein\u2019s has its shortcomings\u2014breaking down in the quantum realm where the relationships between the building blocks of matter and spacetime become vexingly probabilistic. \nWhat\u2019s more, neither Newton\u2019s nor Einstein\u2019s theories fully explain the mysterious fact that the gravitational hand of unseen dark matter holds together most of the \u201cstuff\u201d in the universe or that the entire cosmos is undergoing an accelerating expansion driven by a seemingly antigravitational force called dark energy. These and other cracks in the great edifice of physics are increasingly compelling theorists to reconsider what gravity might be and how it works. What if, instead of being the main character, gravity is only a bit player\u2014a footnote? \nErik Verlinde, a Dutch cosmologist at the University of Amsterdam, is at the forefront of a new wave of thinking in theoretical physics that aims to revise a Newtonian universe with a quantum pen. According to his theories, gravity is not so much a fundamental force but rather a by-product of a universe weaved onto a deeper scaffolding of quantum interactions and thermodynamics. In Verlinde\u2019s formulation dark energy arises naturally from gravity\u2019s emergence, and dark matter is an illusion produced by our misunderstanding of these effects. \nJoin Erik Verlinde tonight at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario for a bold reappraisal of gravity and dark matter that could produce a more complete draft of the story of the universe.

From the peacock tail and the eyespots of a butterfly , to the evolving camouflage of the chameleon, nature loves patterns. \nBiologists may be able to tell you why an animal has a certain pattern. For example, it may have evolved its skin pattern for mating purposes , as a warning sign , or for defence purposes . However, we are still in the dark when it comes to how the patterns are produced. \nAlthough we currently lack the experimental insight, mathematicians have been playing around with pattern formation equations since 1952, when the great Alan Turing published the seminal paper, The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis . In this paper, he presented a theory that said patterns could spontaneously appear using nothing more than a protein\u2019s natural tendency to move randomly through tissue and interact with other cells and proteins. \nThe theory is incredibly counter-intuitive, and we can only wonder how Turing discovered it. Patterns, as Turing saw them, depend on two components: interacting agents and agent diffusion. Each component on its own does not create a pattern. In fact, diffusion is a well-known pattern destroyer: if you put milk in water (and don\u2019t stir), the milk will diffuse\u2014or spread\u2014out across the cup. You don\u2019t end up with spots, or stripes of milk. You just have a cup of uniform milky water. \nTuring\u2019s genius saw through this and he demonstrated that if you combine these two components in just the right way, diffusion could actually drive the system to form spots and stripes. This idea was so far ahead of its time that we are still working on unravelling its complexity 65 years later. Light and dark \nUnfortunately, biology refuses to be so simple. Diffusion assumes that the agents which create a pattern\u2014for example, chemicals, proteins or cells\u2014are dumb, in that they move around space randomly. However, in 2014, the experimental lab of Shigeru Kondo demonstrated that cells in particular are more cunning than we thought . \nKondo\u2019s lab works on understanding the black and white stripes presented on zebrafish, a tropical freshwater fish, which is native to the Himalayan region. They discovered that zebrafish skin patterns are made up of a light type of cell (xanthophore) and a dark type of cell (melanophore) that interact with each other. Specifically, the light cells spread out tendrils to investigate their environment. \nUnexpectedly, Kondo\u2019s team found that when the light cell touches a dark cell a chasing mechanism is instigated. The light cell slowly moves towards the dark cell while the dark cell quickly \u201cruns away\u201d. Complicating matters further is the fact that the chasing doesn\u2019t occur along a straight line. The cells move at an angle to one another, resulting in a spiralling chase. \nMy work extended Turing\u2019s theory to accommodate this new knowledge of \u201cchasing\u201d cells. First, I modelled the system as a set of discrete, individual cells. This mathematical model is highly accurate, but difficult to work with. I then simplified the model by assuming that there are a large number of cells. \nHaving more cells may seem to complicate the system, but by increasing the number of cells you can stop worrying about each individual component and simply consider the properties of the whole population. To put this in real world terms, it means that when you consider the Great Wall of China, you do not have to worry about a single brick, but rather see it as the whole structure. \nAlthough I lost accuracy on individual cell locations, the simplification allowed me to use a whole toolbox of other techniques that mathematicians have been constructing over the past 60 years. So I am able to exactly specify the conditions under which cellular populations will produce patterns and conditions under which patterns will not exist. \nIncredibly, with the additional complexity of chasing cells we were able to greatly expand the catalogue of available patterns. No longer does a system have to evolve to a stationary pattern of spots or stripes. These chasing cells can produce patterns of rotating hexagons, spots that shuttle past each other and, perhaps most complex of all, constantly evolving stripes that oscillate to and fro. \nAll of this complexity is wrapped up in the description of how the cells chase one another: if you change the description, you change the pattern. Critically, this confirms one of Kondo\u2019s experimental hypotheses, as not only did he experiment on normal, or wild-type, zebrafish he also experimented on mutant fish that presented broken stripes, spots, or no pattern at all. \nSpecifically, he discovered that the mutant fish which presented different patterns also presented a different chasing strategy between the dark and light cells. He concluded that the tissue-scale pattern of the skin, could be dictated by the micro-scale pattern of the cells. Incredibly, the mathematics appears to confirm this idea, although more work needs to be done to ensure a complete comparison between theory and experiment. \nThere is little doubt in my mind that the cellular interactions will still be more complicated than we currently know. Indeed, it maybe another 65 years before we are able to truly pin down the causes of zebrafish pattern formation. In the meantime, you can be sure that mathematics will be providing biologists with a new microscope with which to examine biological problems beyond their current experimental expertise. \nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

Measurements by Cassini suggest an ocean may lurk beneath Dione's surface. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute Advertisement \nOur solar system is filled with oceans. But only a few of those have captivated our attention. \nDuring its 1979 Jupiter flyby, NASA\u2019s Voyager 1 spacecraft found the surface of the moon Europa to be a cracked-up jumble of water ice, as if composed of icebergs floating atop some hidden sea. As the craft moved on to Saturn, it took measurements of that planet\u2019s massive moon, Titan, and revealed the frigid world bore a thick atmosphere that could sustain lakes or seas of liquid hydrocarbons on the veiled, cryogenic surface below. \nIt took follow-ups by NASA\u2019s Galileo mission that arrived at Jupiter in 1995, and later by the Saturn orbiter Cassini\u2014a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA)\u2014to confirm this early evidence for extraterrestrial oceans. Galileo also hinted that two other Jovian moons, Callisto and Ganymede, perhaps harbored oceans as well. Cassini found abundant evidence of multiple ocean-bearing moons during its 13 years of studying the Saturnian system. In part because of these discoveries, both Galileo and Cassini were deliberately crashed into their respective gas-giant subjects, burning up in their atmospheres to avoid any chance of biocontaminating each planet\u2019s promising moons. Galileo\u2019s self-immolation occurred in 2003, and Cassini\u2019s fiery end just unfolded on September 15. \nWhen it reached Saturn in 2004 Cassini deployed a European-built lander, Huygens, to land on Titan\u2019s frozen surface, where it found a bizarre landscape of methane\u2013ethane lakes and hydrocarbon snows. In later observations Cassini revealed Titan possesses a watery ocean beneath its surface of hydrocarbon slush. The breakout star of Cassini\u2019s investigations, however, was unquestionably Enceladus, an icy moon about as big as England is wide\u2014too small, researchers had thought, to sustain much interesting geologic activity. \nAgainst all odds Cassini found the moon jetting plumes of salty water vapor from its south pole\u2014an unmistakable signpost of some kind of mysterious ocean hidden beneath its icy crust. Where there is liquid water, the thinking goes, there might well be life\u2014just as there is on Earth, where water forms the cornerstone of biology as we know it. And unlike Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, which Galileo had shown contains a sunless sea perhaps impenetrably sealed beneath a thick crust of ice, Enceladus\u2019s plumes offered a way to obtain direct samples of its dark waters. Starry-eyed astrobiologists were instantly enamored with this wee moon\u2014and they still are. \nBut other astrobiologically interesting moons circle Saturn, too. A bit more than 400,000 kilometers from Enceladus spins another icy satellite, named Dione. Twice as big and similarly coated in ice and snow, it has something else in common with Enceladus: it is probably an ocean world. \u201cThere\u2019s really good evidence\u201d for Dione\u2019s ocean, says Bonnie Buratti, a senior research scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who worked on the Cassini mission. \u201cI kind of feel this is one of the things we\u2019ve left hanging as we leave the Saturn system, that we just haven\u2019t answered.\u201d \nOcean worlds are bodies in the solar system that manage (or managed in the past, like Mars) to hold onto enough liquid water to form seas, lakes and other potential aquatic abodes for life. The newly discovered ones in the outer solar system still harboring oceans today all possess some internal energy source that keeps them from freezing solid like some of their siblings. Scientists argue over the details but most agree those worlds are warmed from within by a combination of radioactive decay and tidal heating (the friction-inducing flexure of their crusts from the gravitational pull of the parent planet). \nBuratti lays out the case for Dione\u2019s membership in this elite club: Its surface is fairly smooth, meaning something has been filling in and covering up the spots where craters and fissures might otherwise form. Liquid water rising from a moon-girdling subsurface reservoir, then freezing, would work nicely for that. Tentative evidence from Cassini\u2019s instruments also hinted at plume activity\u2014albeit much weaker than at Enceladus\u2014as if a similar but subtler mechanism is at play inside Dione. Buratti and others suspect that Janiculum Dorsa, one of the moon\u2019s few mountains, may be somehow responsible, but the scientists were unable to gather definitive proof before Cassini\u2019s termination. \nJaniculum Dorsa may be Dione\u2019s equivalent of Enceladus\u2019s south pole, where water gushes more than 60 kilometers into space. On the latter this mechanism (called cryovolcanism) is fed by an underwater ocean\u2014and there is similar albeit more circumstantial evidence for Janiculum Dorsa as the source of similar \u201ccryovolcanic\u201d plume activity on Dione. \nCassini\u2019s measurements of Dione\u2019s gravitational field also indicate that something strange is going on beneath the surface. When a spacecraft flies by a completely solid body, the craft\u2019s trajectory tends to be more or less \u201cstraight.\u201d In simple terms, it flies by without a discernable difference in the amount of gravity attracting it. But if the body is less homogeneous\u2014for instance, a liquid ocean beneath an icy crust\u2014the spacecraft\u2019s trajectory can exhibit faint but detectable deviations in the tug due to this liquid mass. This is precisely what Cassini experienced as it swooped by Dione. \u201cIf Dione has an ocean, it\u2019s another example where there might be a habitable environment because we have liquid water\u2014there\u2019s a heat source and there might be organic molecules in there that contribute to primitive bacterial life,\u201d Buratti says. \nAnd Dione is not the only promising place passed over by many astrobiologists infatuated with Enceladus, Titan and Europa. There are at least a half dozen other ocean worlds that might merit inclusion in the quest to discover alien life. \u201cMight\u201d being the operative term here\u2014these oft-overlooked oceans tend to be less accessible than their more popular peers. They are either locked beneath thicker ice crusts or just so far out in the solar system (in the cases of moons of Uranus and Neptune) that no one can yet say how promising their hidden seas really are. That is, save Dione\u2014which appears to be a sleepier but no less interesting cross between Enceladus and Europa. The Most Massive Moon of All \nGanymede is a truly giant moon. Larger than Mercury and not much smaller than Mars, it is a would-be planet forever demoted from that lofty status by its host Jupiter. Just as Dione is perennially overshadowed by Enceladus and Titan, Ganymede tends to take a back seat to its sister ocean world, Europa, which is slated to be studied up close by NASA\u2019s Europa Clipper mission sometime in the 2020s. But Ganymede is deserving of study, too: Telltale cycles of auroral activity on the surface, witnessed from afar by the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit, reveal oscillations in the moon\u2019s magnetic field best explained by the internal sloshing of a huge ocean hundreds of kilometers below the surface. \nHow huge? Olivier Witasse, a project scientist working on ESA\u2019s future Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), says Ganymede\u2019s ocean is even bigger than Europa\u2019s\u2014and might be the largest in the entire solar system. \u201cThe Ganymede ocean is believed to contain more water than the Europan one,\u201d he says. \u201cSix times more water in Ganymede\u2019s ocean than in Earth's ocean, and three times more than Europa.\u201d \nJUICE will orbit Ganymede, giving scientists a chance to study this second-fiddle moon in detail. On the way there the craft will make several sweeps past another potentially ocean-bearing Jovian moon, Callisto. \u201cWe think that Callisto also harbors a subsurface ocean, but the available data is unclear,\u201d Witasse says. \u201cWhat we hope to do is to check whether there is an ocean or not\u2014and if yes, at which depth.\u201d Icy Moons around Icy Giants \nOut past Jupiter and Saturn other ocean worlds may be found as well. The moon Ariel twirls in a two-day orbit just 190,000 kilometers from the gas-giant Uranus. All we know about the moon comes from a single encounter with the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986. That flyby revealed Ariel to be relatively smooth, as if its surface was being continually renewed by activity deep within. It is currently believed to be the only ocean world in the Uranian system. \nThe smoothness of Ariel\u2019s surface may be a hallmark of \u201cextrusive cryovolcanism,\u201d or geyser activity that throws material onto a world\u2019s surface. Imagine a flow of molten rock from a volcano on Earth, except with the flow being made of molten ice\u2014in other words, liquid water. Zibi Turtle, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, says finding and studying instances of cryovolcanism would be a \u201choly grail in solar system evolution\u201d that could explain how icy worlds, oceanic or not, change over time. She says there may also be a tentative connection between Ariel\u2019s geology and the Uranian rings\u2014but without more data, not much more can be said. (Enceladus\u2019s plumes similarly interact with one of the rings of Saturn, steadily replenishing and maintaining the ring\u2019s tenuous existence with injections of icy particles.) \u201cReally, the best way to learn about the interiors and geologic history\u2014the evolution of these satellites\u2014is going to be another mission that goes through or in orbit around the Uranian system,\u201d she notes. \nFarther out, the gas-giant planet Neptune has only one moon of any substantial size, Triton. The satellite appears to be a captured interloper from the Kuiper Belt, a diffuse ring of icy bodies at the outer reaches of the solar system. That would make it kin to Pluto, the Kuiper Belt\u2019s largest denizen. Data from Voyager 2, which encountered Neptune in 1989, suggest Triton possesses a very thin atmosphere and more than a few geysers on its surface. \u201cWhat is actually driving the cryovolcanism? It\u2019s got to be pretty powerful because it\u2019s shooting this material quite high above tiny Triton,\u201d says Heidi Hammel, a senior research scientist at the Space Science Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that it\u2019s leaking, it\u2019s jetting these materials.\u201d The answer, as far as researchers can tell, is the same combination of radioactive decay and tidal forces that sustains oceans on other frozen moons of the outer solar system. But geysers that shoot as high as Triton\u2019s, she notes, would require a particularly potent heat source and a massive ocean. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s a case to be made to look at Triton in the light of a very habitable environment,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an active world. It has cryovolcanoes and we\u2019ve seen them. There\u2019s a whole lot of material from these cryovolcanoes that is black, dark,\u201d which indicates the presence of organic materials, according to Hammel. \nTriton, it seems, is a hipster ocean world\u2014it was seen spouting geysers decades before the plumes of Enceladus were astrobiology\u2019s next big thing. That it has been overlooked for so long is due to its immense distance from Earth and the fact that it has only been visited once, for a handful of hours by Voyager 2. But if Triton is so promising, what then of Pluto, its Kuiper Belt cousin? On this world, planetary scientists may find the weirdest potential ocean world of all. The Heart of the Matter \nDuring its 2015 Pluto flyby NASA\u2019s New Horizons probe only had about 12 hours to study the dwarf planet Pluto before it was a fading point of light in the rearview. The spacecraft had to make use of every available moment, and that intense scrutiny revealed signs of something spectacular but not yet entirely certain: Pluto appears to have an ocean, too. \nScientists had long suspected what New Horizons confirmed: Pluto is mostly made of ices\u2014not only water, but also of more volatile substances like nitrogen and methane that freeze solid at extremely low temperatures. Yet the spacecraft measured Pluto to be more compact than it was expected to be, given its mass, because freezing water should have expanded and pushed the surface outward. There is also a surprising amount of geologic activity at Sputnik Planitia, the heart-shaped region sprawled across one of Pluto\u2019s hemispheres. All that tumult on a world long thought to be locked in deep-freeze suggests some reservoir of heat must linger within\u2014an ocean, perhaps. If so, though, that ocean would be decidedly atypical. \nBill McKinnon, a Washington University in Saint Louis professor and New Horizons team member, says ammonia is believed to be plentiful on Pluto, albeit hard to detect remotely from a spacecraft flying by at thousands of kilometers per hour. That ammonia, he says, should mix with any water below, which might still be in liquid form even billions of years after the dwarf planet\u2019s formation. \u201cIf the ocean is able to cool and not freeze, then the ammonia helps to keep it from disappearing,\u201d he says. This would make the ocean fairly viscous. \u201cAt those temperatures it ends up having the consistency of honey,\u201d he says. But the scant bit of time New Horizons spent in the Plutonian system means one unfortunate thing: There is insufficient data to conclusively prove the model. \u201cIt\u2019s a story, it\u2019s not proof,\u201d McKinnon notes. \u201cAt least it hangs together conceptually.\u201d \nThe only way to further study these ocean worlds is via targeted missions. Europa, of course, will be lavished with attention by Europa Clipper and JUICE. But outside of that, Ganymede and Callisto are currently the sole also-ran ocean worlds with planned visits\u2014from JUICE. Despite their revered status, even Enceladus and Titan lack committed follow-up investigations, but that could change by the end of the year if NASA chooses to pursue a mission to either as part of the agency\u2019s New Frontiers program of midsize interplanetary missions. Uranus and Neptune missions have been discussed\u2014and rejected\u2014for decades, with no concepts for exploration ever advancing beyond the preplanning stages. Of all the lesser-known worlds, Turtle says, \u201cthe two that really cry out to me are Ariel and Dione. I think Dione has some surprises still.\u201d \nJUICE could make Ganymede and Callisto\u2019s oceans seem less remote and more dynamic, and maybe even confirm some tentative evidence of cryovolcanism at Ganymede, once again revolutionizing our understanding of these mysterious moons. But without more missions to the outer solar system, inquisitive scientists\u2014as well as the curious public they serve\u2014will be left with more questions than answers for several decades to come. The oceans, of course, will wait.

Nate Stephenson, a U.S. Geological Survey ecologist, makes his way up a hill, stepping over fallen logs. He stops in front of a small, dead red fir, which a hanging metal tag identifies as \u201c189.\u201d Stephenson points out a section of its trunk where the USGS field crew cut away the bark, revealing the squiggly signature of the fir engraver beetle scrawled across the brown sapwood. Number 189 is just one of the more than 100 million trees researchers estimate died during California\u2019s five-year drought, which ended this spring. \nThe drought\u2014one of the state\u2019s worst in centuries \u2014devastated the park\u2019s forests. The dead trees raise a series of questions for Stephenson: Why did some trees perish when others lived? Why did some parts of the forest suffer more than others? Why 189 and not its neighbor? \u201cIt\u2019s a detective game,\u201d he says. As the world warms, the answers could be critical in helping save forests struck by increasingly severe droughts . To predict the effects of these extreme events, scientists need to better understand how forests work normally\u2014and for ecologists like Stephenson, that means figuring out why trees die. \nStephenson and his colleagues have spent decades studying thousands of dead trees\u2014digging up roots to check for fungus, scraping away bark to search for beetle tunnels, looking for patterns among the dead. Since 1982 field crews have spent summers visiting plots scattered around Sequoia National Park. Each year they record the condition of all the trees in those plots; every five years they measure the diameter of the trunks. If a tree dies, they give it an autopsy. All told, they have tracked the lives of more than 30,000 individual trees. \nFor most of the years that scientists monitored it, tree 189 hardly changed. Between 1982 and 1987 it grew two centimeters, and then it stopped growing for the next 15 years. In 2000 it started to lean, after a neighboring tree toppled over and hit 189 on the way down. It also became infested with parasitic dwarf mistletoe. The next year brown felt mold covered its needles and the year after that some of its foliage yellowed. Then its trunk started weeping pitch. For the next decade it sputtered along, sickly and barely growing. Then, in 2012, the drought struck.In 2016 tree 189 died. Field crew members cleared the soil from its roots and found root rot, which had weakened it. But it was tunneling engraverbeetles that ultimately doomed the fir. \nThere is immense value in having such a detailed history of an individual tree, says Beverly Bulaon, a U.S. Forest Service entomologist who helps train USGS field crews. Tracking a tree year by year lets researchers see exactly how it grows weaker and more vulnerable, as ailments and environmental stresses accumulate. Knowing this progression can help scientists understand which other trees are at risk, she says. \nThe stories of these trees are even more useful when studied as a collection. In a 2016 study published in Ecology USGS ecologist Adrian Das, Stephenson and their colleague Kristin Davis of Colorado State University\u2019s Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory tracked the lives of more than 23,000 trees in plots throughout Sequoia National Park over a 13-year period. On average about 2 percent of the trees died each year, with insects or pathogens destroying more than half of them. This was a surprise, Stephenson says\u2014foresters have assumed that most trees that die under normal conditions simply lose the competition for light, water or nutrients. \nThe drought hit the year after the period covered in the Ecology study. In general, Das says, the organisms fatal to trees during the study were the same ones that killed them en masse during the drought. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new suite of organisms,\u201d he says. \u201cThey just start operating at different scales and in new ways.\u201d Some of the culprits are well known, such as the pine beetles that boomed in population during the drought, Das notes. But less is known about many other organisms, such as another type of beetle that suddenly began assailing incense cedars during the drought or the weevil that started attacking young pines. Without baseline information about what killed trees before the drought, Das explains, ecologists would have overlooked these details. \nForests face a tough future, says David Breshears, an ecologist at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study. Scientists predict hotter and deadlier droughts will strike forests as the climate changes. Many places have already experienced tree die-offs like California\u2019s. Researchers have also found that over the last few decades the rate of trees dying under more normal conditions has increased dramatically in many parts of the world\u2014including in Sequoia National Park. They think the rise in tree deaths is likely caused by stress due to insufficientwater, and also perhaps because of escalated attacks by insects and pathogens. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence that suggests we\u2019re going to start losing a lot of trees,\u201d Breshears says. \nIn Sequoia National Park Stephenson continues through a plot, passing trees 149, 6426, 265 and hundreds of others, living and dead, all with their dangling metal tags. He feels like the forest looks about the same as it did when he helped tag this plot decades ago. But it has changed\u2014trees have grown and died, and new ones have sprouted\u2014shifts that would have gone largely unnoticed without tagging. \nForests will continue to change in the future, likely faster than ever\u2014but ecologists may still be able to protect especially valuable forests from climate change and other threats. In some places that might mean thinning trees\u2014in others, watering trees or spraying them with pheromones that repel specific types of beetles. The strategy will depend on identifying which trees are most vulnerable, and to what. \u201cThis information we\u2019re getting on what\u2019s killing trees could help us buy time,\u201d Stephenson says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can stop change from happening but if we can ease a transition rather than have it all at once, probably everyone is going to be happier.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breshears", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zach st. george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beverly bulaon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adrian das", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nate stephenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david breshears", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristin davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "das", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. forest service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado state university\u2019s natural resource ecology laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook credit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sierra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. geological survey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usgs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sequoia national park stephenson", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sequoia national park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T13:54:47.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eba22e8f5dff96a5e1b2fb17fd3fb0df9618a976", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcTsOZxIRaDKBK3JcNgD0fP1OrDOZTfmz3w7QT03QWY95MPqb0tkGh0_hsnFGFmEY2POvIm6gjNwtvDws9zlS9kEE3iywZX5zGWrMQQTDJwy7Zg_NPuTGA", "site_full": "blogs.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "http://rss.sciam.com/ScientificAmerican-Global\r", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Scientific American Content: Global", "title": "Let's Reserve Half of Earth for Conservation", "title_full": "Let's Reserve Half of Earth for Conservation", "published": "2017-10-05T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/F1B6D073-8341-41F7-A00B122D0B56AD1F_agenda.jpg?w=600&amp;h=335", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eba22e8f5dff96a5e1b2fb17fd3fb0df9618a976", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcTsOZxIRaDKBK3JcNgD0fP1OrDOZTfmz3w7QT03QWY95MPqb0tkGh0_hsnFGFmEY2POvIm6gjNwtvDws9zlS9kEE3iywZX5zGWrMQQTDJwy7Zg_NPuTGA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James E.

The 2015 Paris climate agreement states that global warming must be limited to a rise in temperature of less than 2\u02daC above pre-industrial levels to avoid the greatest impacts of climate change. This goal has served as a rallying point for global efforts to limit carbon emissions. \nHowever, a comparably clear, agreed target for the amount of natural space that should be conserved to address the biodiversity crisis has been much more elusive. \nThe idea of securing at least half of our planet for nature conservation has recently been gathering momentum. Various studies indicate that achieving this \u201cHalf-Earth\u201d goal\u2014the name given to this endeavor by pre-eminent biologist E. O. Wilson\u2014would help to avoid widespread biodiversity declines and prevent the collapse of vital services provided by ecosystems, such as carbon sequestration and climate regulation. \nUnfortunately, the goal of 50 percent protection of all terrestrial ecosystems far exceeds current global conservation commitments. For example, the plan that is currently accepted by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity has a target of protecting 17 percent of land and freshwater regions and 10 percent of marine areas by 2020. \nThe much greater scale of conservation needed for Half-Earth protection has left many people questioning whether it is even possible given the unrelenting rate of habitat conversion eroding opportunities for large-scale conservation on a daily basis. \nEric Dinerstein and his colleagues have made a first attempt to answer this key ques\u00adtion for land areas, and their findings are both encouraging and disheartening. Writing in BioScience not long ago , they analyzed the current level of ecosystem protection on a global scale. The authors\u2019 data clearly demonstrate that achieving Half-Earth conservation is indeed still possible in many places, but not everywhere. \nThey began by determining which of the earth\u2019s 846 terrestrial ecoregions had at least 50 percent of their natural habitat remaining by studying satellite-derived maps of forest cover, land use patterns, and human occupancy. They found that nearly half of the world\u2019s ecoregions have the remaining habitat necessary to achieve a Half-Earth protection target. Roughly one-eighth of these are already 50 percent protected. \nAbout a quarter of the ecoregions with less than 50 percent of natural habitat remaining (requiring substantial restoration) were described by the Dinerstein team as \u201cin peril,\u201d meaning that they have no more than 20 percent remaining. \nBut by assessing the possibility of achieving Half-Earth conservation, Dinerstein and his colleagues have helped to take the first step towards a road map for implementing such a goal. The authors outline the idea of a \u201cglobal deal for nature,\u201d whereby nations agree to achieving Half-Earth conservation, where possible, by 2050. Such an agreement would offer a biodiversity-focused counterpart to the Paris climate accord. \nWhat is needed now is a clear, science-based plan for the next steps to making Half-Earth conservation a reality. We propose that this plan and the science agenda should be based around three fundamental questions. \nThe first question is in many ways the key question in conservation biology: Which are the most important places to conserve? The answer must take into account both the scale of the Half-Earth undertaking and the immense diversity of conservation objectives being considered. As a start, to halt imminent biodiversity loss, places that are home to the last remaining populations of a species and the last samples of any ecosystem type should be prioritized. \nTo complement these irreplaceable sites, we must also identify and protect places that are still large, intact, and functioning in ways that are unimpeded by large-scale human activities. Such areas represent the places best prepared to allow species and ecosystems to self-regenerate and to adapt to stressors that arise from human activity. \nSecond, what are the scope, severity, and trajectory of the threats to local biodiversity? And what are the processes that sustain those threats? To address these questions, we must understand not only the drivers of habitat loss and degradation, but also the nebulous effects that other factors can have on a habitat\u2014things like invasive species, over-harvesting, disease, climate change, and shifts in the occurrence of natural fires. \nAll of these threats (which can be further influenced by social and economic forces) tend to reduce the quality of a given habitat without necessarily affecting its size. Understanding them helps us assess where action is most urgently needed to conserve and restore habitats. It can further allow conservation efforts to focus on minimizing the number of ecoregions that dip below retention of half of their natural habitat. \nAnd finally, in places that require intervention, what measures will be needed to ensure that they maintain their natural integrity? Although protected areas have been the cornerstone of conservation action so far, they would probably have a reduced role in a conservation network that scales up to the level of Half-Earth. \nCompleting the research required to answer these three questions should provide an effective framework for reaching Half-Earth by 2050. The analysis produced by Dinerstein and colleagues has shown that this goal is possible in many places, and has helped to embolden this call for action. Half-Earth is about thinking big, and we urge conservation scientists to play their part in this process. \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

She has won major prizes, including the Satter Prize , Senior Berwick Prize , and Steele Prize, and received honorary doctorates from several universities. She was at MathFest to give the Hedrick lecture series and co-organize research talk sessions in symplectic geometry. \nSymplectic geometry is a cousin of complex geometry. Complex here doesn\u2019t mean complicated but refers to the complex plane, a two-dimensional plane with a real axis and an imaginary axis, where complex numbers like 2+3i live. There\u2019s also a 4-dimensional version of the complex plane, and 6-dimensional, and 8-dimensional, and so on. Likewise, symplectic geometry can inhabit spaces of any even dimension. The complex plane with three points labeled. Credit: Evelyn Lamb \nA symplectic structure on an even-dimensional space is a way of getting measurements from pairs of coordinates. For, say, a 4-dimensional space, you take the two pairs of coordinates and get an \u201carea\u201d measurement for each pair. Then you add those areas. As McDuff says in the episode, it seems like a strange choice, but it ends up being \u201ca very sensible thing to do.\u201d The motivation to take such a measurement actually comes from physics, where the two quantities can represent the position and velocity of an object. \nOne topic of study in symplectic geometry is what kinds of transformations of a shape preserve its symplectic structure. The theorem McDuff chose as her favorite, the non-squeezing theorem, is a result in this direction. As Tara Holm describes in this math graduate student-level introductory article about symplectic geometry (pdf) , the non-squeezing theorem can be interpreted as saying that a camel cannot fit through the eye of a needle, at least as long as camel and needle are symplectic. The theorem was proved by Russian mathematician Mikhail Gromov in the 1980s. \nMcDuff discussed the 4-dimensional version of the theorem: you can\u2019t fit a (4-dimensional ball) into a (4-dimensional) cylinder while preserving the symplectic structure unless the radius of the cylinder is a least as big as than the radius of the ball. It\u2019s hard to think in four dimensions, you can visualize it in three dimensions instead. (I won\u2019t tell anyone.) In three dimensions, if you have a ball with a little give to it\u2014maybe a bean bag or a basketball\u2014you can fit it into a cylinder narrower than the diameter of the ball. If the ball is very soft\u2014made of putty, perhaps\u2014you can fit it into a very thin cylinder, as long as the cylinder is long enough, by stretching it. The non-squeezing theorem says that symplectic structures are more rigid than putty balls: you can\u2019t squeeze them even a little bit and preserve the structure. Even though symplectic geometers are fond of pointing out how \u201cfloppy\u201d symplectic structures are, this theorem shows that they\u2019re much more rigid than something like volume. For maximal enjoyment, pair the non-squeezing theorem with a ripe avocado. Credit: Andrea Pacheco Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0) \nMcDuff recommends pairing the non-squeezing theorem with a luscious avocado. You\u2019ll have to listen to the episode to find out why she thinks it\u2019s the perfect accompaniment to the non-squeezing theorem. \nFor more information on McDuff, check out this Science Lives video produced by the Simons Foundation or this article by McDuff about her life in the September issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society (pdf) . I especially appreciated her reflections on the way implicit biases, including her own, affected her and still affect women in math and science. She has written many papers about symplectic geometry and topology, including this survey article \u201c What is symplectic geometry? \u201d It is a good introduction for someone with an advanced math background. \nYou can find more information about the mathematicians and theorems featured in this podcast, along with other delightful mathematical treats, at kpknudson.com and here at Roots of Unity .

Some do it to deter insects. Some do it to attack bacterial competitors. Some, as I wrote about here two years ago , even seem to craft elaborate flower-like stabbing arrays that they release into the environment for no obvious reason upon their suicide, whereupon the stabbing blossom is co-opted by tube worm larvae as a signal that it\u2019s time to settle down and glue their tube to whatever hard surface happens to be nearby. Whew! \nAnd then there\u2019s Amoebophilus asiaticus . Amoebophilus appears to do it as a tribute to Harry Houdini: it uses its stabby bits to escape digestive jail cells inside amoebas that eat it, according to new research published in Science this summer. And a separate paper published this month in Nature Microbiology has revealed exactly how the machine fires in all these bacteria. \nAll of these bacterial stabbing-systems bear an uncanny resemblance to the DNA-injecting tails of bacteriophage viruses. Such viruses are famous for their lunar-lander appearance and use their tails to inject their DNA into bacteria. The host bacterium becomes a zombie that churns out more viruses before, typically, it explodes, releasing many new viruses to the environment. Credit: Pbroks13 Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 2.5) \nThe bacterial machines that resemble these viruses are called \u201ccontractile injection systems\u201d, and their structure is nearly indistinguishable from the business end of a bacteriophage, minus the helical head that stores the virus\u2019s DNA. The resulting machine is a spear gun capable of injecting poisons or other payloads into its target -- sometimes remotely when the machine is launched into the environment. No one currently knows whether the virus or the bacteria had this equipment first, and who may have stolen what from whom, or even whether they both arrived at the same invention independently. \nIn the paper released last week in Nature Microbiology , scientists from Switzerland and Germany announced they had figured out the \u201cloaded\u201d configuration of both the spear and its gun, and how exactly they interact. \nThe gun is composed of an inner hollow tube and an outer sheath. When the gun fires, the outer sheath contracts to eject the inner tube, which is capped by a spike that acts as spearhead. They also discovered that the launcher rotates its payload, causing the spear to spin like a drill or a rifle bullet. Watch for the spin in this video, along with the emergence of helical ridges on the contracting sheath: \nThe sheath is built of more than 200 interlocking protein rings. During firing, each ring rotates, enlarges, and crowds closer to the anchor plate and its closest ring neighbor, ultimately shrinking the sheath to half its former length while slightly increasing in diameter. The collective motion both propels and sets the spear spinning, while the enlargement of the rings releases it from the barrel\u2019s grip. In less than two milliseconds, the spear has drilled into its target. \nBacteria that possess these weapons do not appear to use them to inject DNA. Instead, they often deliver a payload of chemical weapons put to a variety of uses. Scientists from ETH Zurich, writing in the journal Science in August , announced they have discovered a new use of the contractile injection system as lock pick in Amoebophilus . \nSome bacteria that employ contractile injection systems release their weapons into the environment, where they float around before binding to their target and firing. Those that plague insect larvae, metamorphose tube worms, and attack other bacteria are of this sort. Others are retained inside the bacterium and anchored to its inner membrane, a part of the bacterial hull. Amoebophilus \u2019s guns are of this type, the scientists said, based on microscopic photographs. These anchored artillery-pieces are referred to as \u201cType 6 secretion systems\u201d. Credit: Leo Popovich \nThe Swiss scientists had noticed that although the Amoebophilus genome does not contain genes for any known bacterial secretion system (Type 6 or otherwise), it does contain a cluster of genes that resembles the free-floating contractile injection systems used by some bacteria to attack insects. They wondered whether it might help the bacterium interact with its host, the amoeba. \nAmoebophilus bacteria, true to their name (\u201cAmoeba lover\u201d), can only reproduce inside the body of an amoeba. They appear to be symbionts \u2013 quite possibly parasites, although that is still unclear -- of the amoebas they live in, acquiring both food and shelter from their host. \nWhen they examined Amoebophilus bacteria purified from their hosts under the microscope, they saw that 50% contained what appeared to be a contractile injection system anchored to the inner membrane. The guns were in hexagonal arrays of two to 34 -- on average eight. Most of the time, the cell had two such bundles. Usually, some of the guns in each array had been fired and some remained loaded, a difference that was easy to see by the length, width, and texture of the sheath. The contracted sheath was much shorter, slightly fatter, covered by helical ridges, and empty \u2013 just as you\u2019d expect from a contractile injection system. Amoebophilus, locked and loaded. The contractile injection system is visible as long tubes, either extended(E), or contracted(C). Note that contracted tubes are empty. IM= inner membrane, CP = cytoplasm. Scale bar = 100 nm. Credit: B\u00f6ck et al. 2017 \nThey missing spears were found in the liquid outside the bacteria, but no other parts of the apparatus were with them. \nLoaded injection guns possessed the same structures in the same sizes as a phage tail: sheath, six-footed anchor, base plate, and spear. The loaded spear inside its gun (left), and right, the contractile injection system of a T4 bacteriophage tail overlaid onto it in color (with constituent proteins labeled at far right) for comparison. The spearhead is clearly visible in orange. Credit: B\u00f6ck et al. 2017 \nThe scientists concluded that Amoebophilus possesses a Type 6 secretion system. \nTo see what it was doing with its big guns, they sliced through infected amoebae and observed the thin sections with a microscope. Within 15 minutes of infection, the bacteria were already inside digestive bags called phagosomes (\u201ceating bodies\u201d). But within 2 hours of infection, they had escaped. Credit: Leo Popovich \nAround that time, they saw that more of the Amoebophilus guns had been fired and the genes that make the guns were being used a lot by the bacteria. \nThe scientists also incubated Amoebophilus with red blood cells, which are like big defenseless balloons waiting to be popped. Armed bacteria were not only able to burst red blood cells, they had also fired 30% more of their guns compared to control bacteria not exposed to red blood cells. \nFinally, photographs of Amoebophilus trapped inside phagosomes showed that anywhere a bacterium physically touched the phagosome membrane, the injection guns were adjacent to the point of contact, and at least one of them had been fired. The smoking gun, as it were. Contact sites (black arrowhead and inset) between the phagosome and Amoebophilus . The contractile injection system was always adjacent to such points. Credit: B\u00f6ck et al. 2017 \nIt\u2019s not yet clear, however, whether the phagosome is destroyed by the escape, nor whether it is ruptured by the physical act of puncture or by chemicals delivered by the spears. \nStabbing the phagosome, however, seems to allow Amoebophilus to escape its prison, avoid being eaten, and then to help itself to its host\u2019s pantry while making lots of little bacteria. \nWhere did Amoebophilus acquire its fancy spear guns? Strangely, even though this is technically a Type 6 secretion system, DNA analysis of the genes that make it shows it is more closely related to the free-floating contractile injection systems that kill insects or trigger metamorphosis in tube worms than it is to other Type 6 secretion systems, which are by our definition membrane-bound. The distinction of \u201cattached to the inside of the cell\u201d versus \u201csecreted into the environment\u201d that we have used to segregate Type 6 secretion systems from extracellular contractile injection systems thus seems artificial and invalid from an evolutionary standpoint. \nThe scientists suggest two hypotheses. Either Amoebophilus \u2019s speargun evolved from the extracellular contractile injection systems by losing some of their characteristics (like tail fiber feet) and getting welded to the inside of the cell, or it has retained the features of the ancestor of all contractile injection systems, before they diverged into the Type 6 injection systems and the free-floating systems. \nWhatever the case, the authors say, its existence implies there are a heck of a lot more bacteria out there than we thought that stab things for a living. In DNA searches across Domain Bacteria, they found genes similar to the ones Amoebophilus uses to build its guns in six different bacterial phyla, the high-level taxonomic ranking just below kingdom. Far from being helpless little bags, bacteria appear more than capable of physically manipulating their world by turning themselves into trigger-loaded hypodermic needles that can poison rivals, predators, and prey \u2013 or pick locks inside hosts that give bacteria the run of the place. \nReference \nD\u00e9sir\u00e9e B\u00f6ck, Jo\u00e3o M.

People want their families to be safe, healthy, and educated. How do we get there? The international community took on that question by establishing its 2030 Agenda with clear Sustainable Development Goals, or \u201c Global Goals .\u201d To achieve these ambitious and transformative goals, however, we are going to need both bold new ideas, and robust, open-minded partnerships. The stakes are high\u2014we do not have time for small changes to reverse the massive global challenges we face. We need exponential change. Innovation, technology, and moonshot thinking are key ingredients for impact. But for sustainable and scalable positive change, we are going to need the rigorous thinking and deep knowledge of a diverse group of experts to help develop, study, and deploy our best solutions for the betterment of humankind. Too often, experts stick to people in their circle who share a similar worldview. Sectors can get stuck in their ways and be slow to change. I have a Ph.D. in History, with a focus on development and human rights, and spent about a decade as a professor. Just over three years ago, I left academia and joined the XPRIZE Foundation\u2014a non-profit organization that launches and operates large-scale incentivized prize competitions to leverage technology to solve grand challenges. It would be a vast understatement to say that leaping from the \u201civory tower\u201d of academia into the world of technology competitions was a shock at first. While academia is slow, rigorous, and thoughtful, the tech world is fast, flexible, and easiliy distracted. I have become increasingly convinced of how seriously these worlds need each other, and of the unbelievable progress we could make if we brought together academics, tech developers, governments, private companies, and impassioned citizens. It is both possible and necessary. The opportunity to talk to people from so many walks of life across the globe and try to find common ground is the greatest joy in my work. The Global Learning XPRIZE is one such project I currently help lead that aims to achieve the powerful Global Goal of ensuring inclusive and quality education for all. The prize, backed by a $15 million prize purse from Elon Musk, challenges the world\u2019s innovators to create new software solutions, specifically for out-of-school children. Existing policies and market conditions have left over 250 million children around the globe without the ability to read, write, or do basic math. With the incentivized prize model, we inspire diverse voices and approaches to mobilize resources to address this problem. To get this project off the ground, we enlisted the expertise of experts from fields such as neuroscience, game design, and linguistics. We had 198 teams from 40 countries on six continents register to compete, and we have had the truly amazing opportunity to foster instrumental collaboration with our partners UNESCO, World Food Programme, the Government of Tanzania, and Google. Following the competition\u2019s upcoming field test in Tanzania where the top five solutions will be tested, we aim to connect stakeholders across borders and industries so that new, open-source technologies can reach over 250 million children most in need. Without partners in public and private sectors, we will fail. We seek groundbreaking innovation, but we also need boundary-breaking human connection to harness these new technologies for scalable positive impact. We have an unprecedented moment to combine forces to create a more sustainable, equitable, and abundant future. This week, Scientific American and Macmillan Learning hosts its 5 th annual STEM Executive Summit in New York City. The purpose of this convening is to encourage experts and thought leaders to collaborate across all walks of life to advance STEM education and access. Training and inspiring young people to build their future is foundational. Teaching them to combine this with open partnerships across disciplines and borders is transformational. New technologies are allowing for exponential progress to address our biggest challenges. We need innovative, bold thinking and strong STEM solutions.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech Advertisement \nThere's a prosaic explanation for at least some of the weirdness of \"Tabby's star,\" it would appear. \nThe bizarre long-term dimming of Tabby's star \u2014also known as Boyajian's star, or, more formally, KIC 8462852\u2014is likely caused by dust, not a giant network of solar panels or any other \"megastructure\" built by advanced aliens, a new study suggests. \nAstronomers came to this conclusion after noticing that this dimming was more pronounced in ultraviolet (UV) than infrared light. Any object bigger than a dust grain would cause uniform dimming across all wavelengths, study team members said. [ 13 Ways to Hunt Intelligent Aliens ] \n\"This pretty much rules out the alien megastructure theory, as that could not explain the wavelength-dependent dimming,\" lead author Huan Meng of the University of Arizona said in a statement . \"We suspect, instead, there is a cloud of dust orbiting the star with a roughly 700-day orbital period.\" Strange brightness dips \nKIC 8462852, which lies about 1,500 light-years from Earth, has generated a great deal of intrigue and speculation since 2015. That year, a team led by astronomer Tabetha Boyajian (hence the star's nicknames) reported that KIC 8462852 had dimmed dramatically several times over the past half-decade or so, once by 22 percent. \nNo orbiting planet could cause such big dips, so researchers began coming up with possible alternative explanations . These included swarms of comets or comet fragments, interstellar dust and the famous (but unlikely) alien-megastructure hypothesis. \nThe mystery deepened after the initial Boyajian et al. study. For example, other research groups found that, in addition to the occasional short-term brightness dips, Tabby's star dimmed overall by about 20 percent between 1890 and 1989. In addition, a 2016 paper determined that its brightness decreased by 3 percent from 2009 to 2013. \nThe new study, which was published online Tuesday (Oct. 3) in The Astrophysical Journal , addresses such longer-term events. \nFrom January 2016 to December 2016, Meng and his colleagues (who include Boyajian) studied Tabby's star in infrared and UV light using NASA's Spitzer and Swift space telescopes, respectively. They also observed it in visible light during this period using the 27-inch-wide (68 centimeters) telescope at AstroLAB IRIS, a public observatory near the Belgian village of Zillebeke. \nThe observed UV dip implicates circumstellar dust\u2014grains large enough to stay in orbit around Tabby's star despite the radiation pressure but small enough that they don't block light uniformly in all wavelengths, the researchers said. Mysteries remain \nThe new study does not solve all of KIC 8462852's mysteries, however. For example, it does not address the short-term 20 percent brightness dips, which were detected by NASA's planet-hunting Kepler space telescope. (Kepler is now observing a different part of the sky during its K2 extended mission and will not follow up on Tabby's star for the forseeable future.) \nAnd a different study\u2014led by Joshua Simon of the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Pasadena, California\u2014just found that Tabby's star experienced two brightening spells over the past 11 years. (Simon and his colleagues also determined that the star has dimmed by about 1.5 percent from February 2015 to now.) \n\"Up until this work, we had thought that the star's changes in brightness were only occurring in one direction\u2014dimming,\" Simon said in a statement . \"The realization that the star sometimes gets brighter in addition to periods of dimming is incompatible with most hypotheses to explain its weird behavior.\" \nYou can read the Simon et al. study for free at the online preprint site arXiv.org .

In a city otherwise riven by partisan battles, the commission\u2019s work is good news and deserves attention. It\u2019s the brainchild of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R\u2013Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D\u2013Wash.). The premise is simple: Federal government data can help produce better informed decisions. \u201cFor example, according to the report , \u201c access to administrative data has improved federal investment in workforce training by making possible comparisons in changes in quarterly earnings between different training and employment programs.\u201d \nThere are some caveats, though. Much of the information in question is personal data, and there are real privacy concerns when particulars about people are combined across federal agencies. That could lead to secretive profiling and unfair and unaccountable decision-making. In fact, a proposal in the mid-1960s to create a national data center\u2014also to ensure better policy-making by the federal government\u2014produced such a backlash that Congress enacted comprehensive legislation to limit federal agencies\u2019 ability to gather and collect personal information. \nIn passing the 1974 Privacy Act Congress recognized that statistical data, such as the U.S. census, can help inform government policy while minimizing privacy risks. And so, the same law that limits use of personal data recognizes the critical role of statistical information to promote smart government. \nOver time technology has chipped away at the ability to separate statistical from personal data. The use of microdata, new techniques for \u201creidentifying\u201d people whose data had supposedly been made anonymous, commercial incentives and even criminal hacking could foil even the best attempts to prevent individuals from being identified. The commission urged the adoption of privacy enhancement and preservation techniques\u2014such as the use of differential privacy algorithms that glean information from a person\u2019s data without identifying that person\u2014to minimize privacy risks. It also recommended the creation of a national secure data service to manage multisource data projects without creating a centralized repository. And in a related report the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has stated that agencies must be responsible for ensuring that privacy techniques work as advertised. \nStill, the larger goal of promoting better use of government data is laudable. Remarkably, in the privacy field some of the most sensitive data in government is made available to the public. For almost 50 years the Administrative Office of the United States Courts has provided detailed reports on the use of surveillance authority in the U.S. Those reports document the use of wiretapping by the federal government\u2014its frequency, cost, reasons for use (most wiretaps concern drug investigations not terrorism) and effectiveness. The data makes possible meaningful oversight of law enforcement activities. And even when law enforcement agencies and civil liberties advocates debate the scope of government surveillance, there is a common data set that informs the discussion. Remarkably, the data is made available without compromising investigations or revealing the names of individuals \nOf course, a lot of the data collected by federal agencies does not threaten privacy at all. Consider the important work of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its recent tracking of hurricanes across the Atlantic Ocean. Meteorological data is becoming increasingly important as the severity of storms increases. State and local officials need the best information possible to make difficult decisions about how to deploy resources and when to evacuate residents of coastal communities. Our ability to forecast storms has improved dramatically from 1900, when a hurricane\u2014which still ranks as the most deadly natural disaster in our nation\u2019s history\u2014took the lives of approximately 10,000 people in Galveston, Texas. The reason for the high death toll was the lack of accurate forecasting and therefore the lack of preparation. But there is more to do. \nEven today, U.S. hurricane forecasting lags others. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) model is now considered the premier global model in the world. And so, U.S. weather forecasters often superimpose the ECMWF tracks when discussing recent storm activity in the U.S. The U.S. needs to do better, and data in the federal government is a good starting point. \nWith the report on Evidence-Based Policymaking completed, the work of the commission will now be transferred to the Bipartisan Policy Center . That is also a hopeful sign. The formulation of evidence-based policies should remain a priority, regardless of party affiliation. \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

But in an unexpected discovery, scientists have found one place where the effects of climate change are having the opposite impact. \nIt seems that river deltas on the coast of Greenland are actually growing bigger at a time when many deltas elsewhere around the world\u2014and even elsewhere throughout the Arctic\u2014are eroding away. The finding is all the more surprising considering that Greenland is home to the world's second-largest ice sheet, whose melting glaciers are among the planet's biggest potential contributors to future sea-level rise. \nHere's the surprise: It's the melting glaciers that are causing these delta regions to expand, scientists say. \nIn their findings published Tuesday in the journal Nature , the researchers note that as glaciers melt, they send fresh water and loose sediment flowing out toward the ocean. The sediment is then deposited along the coastline where the rivers meet the sea, causing the delta to expand outward. \n\"We were surprised to see that in Greenland we had the exact opposite trend of what is going on in the rest of the Arctic,\" said Mette Bendixen of the University of Copenhagen, the study's lead author. \nThe researchers had expected the ocean to play a bigger role in eroding away the coastline, as it has elsewhere\u2014especially as climate change is causing more Arctic sea ice to melt away, leaving the surface of the water exposed. Instead, they found that Greenland's deltas are largely shielded from the ocean's waves by the presence of large, steep-cliffed fjords. \nThe researchers made their discovery by examining aerial imagery from the 1940s and 1980s\u2014including photographs taken on flights by the U.S. Army during World War II\u2014and Google Earth satellite imagery from the 2000s to see how Greenland's deltas had changed over time. They found that the deltas remained mostly static between the 1940s and the 1980s, but expanded from the 1980s on. \nThese findings suggest that Greenland's glaciers have been experiencing increasing ice loss for at least three decades\u2014a result that may reinforce scientists' concerns over the stability of the melting ice sheet. The research also suggests that areas with more intense meltwater runoff are seeing the most expansion along the coastline. \nIt may seem like the Greenland coast is catching a rare break, while other coastal regions throughout the Arctic are slipping away. According to Bendixen, it's been well-documented that shorelines in Alaska, Canada and Russia are \"generally eroding,\" and there's great concern about what will happen to the human communities in these places. Multiple Alaskan villages have already begun preparing for the need to relocate. \nBut Bendixen cautioned that Greenland's expanding deltas are not necessarily a good thing for nearby human communities either. They rely heavily on fishing and tourism, she noted\u2014but as the deltas push outward, the harbors that these industries depend on become sandy and difficult to navigate. And if ice loss continues to accelerate in the warming Arctic, this effect may only become more pronounced in the future. \nBut these changes send another message, as well, one that reverberates far beyond the Greenland shore. The shifting coastline is a sobering reminder that Greenland's ice sheet is changing, as well, in ways that could have dramatic consequences throughout the rest of the world. \nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&E News.

Credit: Steve Gschmeissner Getty Images Advertisement \nSAN DIEGO\u2014Kerri De Nies received the news this spring from her son\u2019s pediatrician: Her chubby-cheeked toddler had a rare brain disorder. \nShe\u2019d never heard of the disease\u2014adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD\u2014and she soon felt devastated and overwhelmed. \n\u201cI probably read everything you could possibly read online\u2014every single website,\u201d De Nies said as she cradled her son, Gregory Mac Phee. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely hard to think about what could potentially happen. You think about the worst-case scenario.\u201d \nALD is a brain disorder depicted in the 1992 movie \u201cLorenzo\u2019s Oil,\u201d about a couple whose son became debilitated by the disease. The most serious form of the illness typically strikes boys between ages 4 and 10. Most are diagnosed too late for treatment to be successful, and they often die before their 10th birthday. \nThe more De Nies learned about ALD, the more she realized how fortunate she and Gregory were to have discovered it so early. Her son\u2019s blood was tested when he was about 10 months old. \nCalifornia is one of only a handful of states nationwide that screens babies for the gene mutation that causes the disease\u2014a test that dramatically increases Gregory\u2019s chances of survival. \nThe state began testing newborns for ALD in September 2016, seven months after the federal government added it to the list of recommended screenings. The testing included all babies born after February of that year. \n\u201cIf you pick it up in the early stages \u2026 you are at a much better place in terms of treating it effectively,\u201d said Florian Eichler, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cThat\u2019s where the newborn screening is so important. It really helps you detect these boys at risk.\u201d \nEichler said he has seen many families whose boys were diagnosed late. \u201cListening to families and their ordeal gives you a real sense of what this has done over generations and how much suffering could be prevented through the screening program,\u201d he said. \nNew York was the first to begin screening, in 2013, followed last year by Connecticut and California. A few other states, including Pennsylvania and Minnesota, have since followed. \n\u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling that not every state is testing,\u201d said De Nies, who teaches children\u2019s ballet in San Diego. \u201cFamilies will not know until it could be too late for them.\u201d \nAdvocates, including several moms who lost their sons to the disease, were instrumental in getting the screening law passed in California. Now they are continuing to lobby legislators and pushing health officials to add ALD to screening panels across the nation. \nJanis Sherwood said that since her son Sawyer\u2019s death from ALD, she has felt an urgency to educate doctors, families and others about the disease. In the past few years, she turned her attention to newborn screening. She believes that as California collects data on how the boys do in treatment, other states will follow. \u201cI think that we are going to see a domino effect as we get more states on board,\u201d she said. \nAbout 1 in every 18,000 people have ALD. Of boys with the genetic defect, about 30 to 40 percent will develop the life-threatening form of the disease, which leads to vision, gait and memory problems\u2014and eventually death. It destroys myelin, the protective surface that surrounds some nerve cells. \nTechnicians draw the blood of newborns in the hospital soon after they are born. In California, state law requires that the blood be tested for about 80 diseases, including cystic fibrosis, severe combined immunodeficiency and primary congenital hypothyroidism. \nAround the nation, testing kits cost a hospital or birthing facility about $120, said Jeff Botkin, who heads the medical ethics division at the University of Utah. \u201cThis is an extraordinarily low cost for this number of tests,\u201d he said in an email. The tests are typically covered by insurers or Medicaid. \nSome conditions on the screening list are relatively common, but ALD is among the rare disorders the tests ferret out that can lead to serious health issues or even death if not detected and treated, Botkin said. \nThere is no answer to the question of how common a condition should be to merit spending health care dollars to test for it, Botkin said. But many of the conditions for which the federal government recommends screening are rare, which means they could affect 1 in 50,000 babies or fewer. \u201cThe major question is whether the condition is treatable,\u201d Botkin said. \nBoth boys and girls get tested for ALD because they can both be carriers of the genetic defect and develop the less serious adult form of the disease. Only boys, however, develop the more serious, ultimately fatal, childhood disease. \nWhen doctors know that boys have the mutation, they perform brain MRIs beginning when the boys are toddlers. If an MRI starts to show telltale changes in the brain, doctors can intervene to halt the progression of the disease. \nThe common treatment, a bone marrow transplant, is risky and complicated, but it is often successful if the donor is a good match and the procedure is performed before the children have visible symptoms, UCLA neurologist Raman Sankar said. Doctors are also having some success with gene therapy, in which the children undergo a transplant with their own stem cells rather than a donor\u2019s, Sankar said. \nThe earlier the transplant, the better a child\u2019s chance of survival, he said. \u201cThe delay may make the difference between whether he can have a lifesaving treatment or not.\u201d \nBefore newborn screening, boys in the early stages of ALD frequently were incorrectly diagnosed with hyperactivity and other conditions, said Richard Olney, who heads the genetic disease screening program for the California public health department. \u201cMany families had to go through a sort of diagnostic odyssey,\u201d he said. \u201cIt only became clear as they developed progressively worse problems that they had a serious genetic condition.\u201d \nBy the time a brain MRI was performed, there was often too much damage to save the child. That\u2019s part of the challenge for clinicians who may not be familiar with ALD: \u201cHow do you know when this is a critical brain disease versus just a normal part of development?\u201d Eichler said. \nThose with the genetic mutation who do not develop the disease in childhood may still have a milder form as adults. People with the mutation also need to be monitored by an endocrinologist, because many will suffer from a condition in which their adrenal glands fail to produce enough of a stress hormone that is needed to fight infections. \nGina Cousineau\u2019s 8-year-old son, Evan, was diagnosed with ALD in May 2007 after he came home from swim practice and had a seizure. Though he underwent a bone marrow transplant, Evan died from a secondary infection before he turned 9. \nCousineau lives in the southern Orange County city of San Clemente and helped lobby for the California law that requires ALD screening. She said newborn testing benefits infants with ALD and can help families discover that siblings or other relatives have the gene mutation. \n\u201cThank God this newborn screening came into effect,\u201d Cousineau said. \u201cKnowledge is power. Had I had the knowledge with my son, Evan, he would be alive today.\u201d \nDe Nies said she worries about Gregory\u2019s future, but she\u2019s confident her son will live a long life. And she credits Cousineau and other mothers whose sons didn\u2019t have the same chance. \n\u201cWithout them, we would never know about the gene mutation,\u201d she said. \u201cI just feel like they are our fairy godmothers.\u201d \nKHN\u2019s coverage in California is funded in part by Blue Shield of California Foundation and coverage of children\u2019s health care issues is supported in part by a grant from The Heising-Simons Foundation . \nThis story was originally published by Kaiser Health News on October 5, 2017.

The word conjures up diverse reactions on the wonder-fear spectrum. Yes, I was fearful before starting your AP Physics class senior year of high school. I loved science, and there was no question that I would take your legendary course. But I secretly feared that when put to the test, I would reach my limit. \nFrom the beginning, your teaching challenged and entranced me. So much that I kept notes in my planner: \u201cCool physics things to tell Dad.\u201d I wanted the people I loved most to experience your captivating logic that revealed the universe\u2019s mysterious order. Dad and I marveled over the list on the daily drive home from school. When he saw you teach first-hand on parent-teachers night, you astonished him with your ability to impart masses of complex information with simple clarity. \nYou made it clear that you cared to know your students as human beings, by asking us to write you letters describing our reasons for taking AP Physics, our passions outside of school, and our long-term goals. After expressing my desire to be a scientist and an astronaut I wrote, \u201cI feel very positive. In fact, I think I can handle pretty much anything life throws at me.\u201d \nLife soon launched me an opportunity to test my presumptuous hypothesis. A few days later, my father died suddenly from a heart attack. \nI was devastated. I hadn\u2019t only lost my dad, I had lost my best friend. My steadfast, empathic supporter, a constant source of curious questions and unbridled delight in learning. In fact, I\u2019m positive now that when I wrote, \u201cI can handle pretty much anything life throws at me,\u201d what I really meant was, \u201cI can handle pretty much anything life throws at me and my Dad.\u201d \nIt was as if without warning someone had lifted me from my comfortable seat in your class- the land of the logical- and placed me alone at the edge of a steep cliff, moments from shattering into a million little pieces. All I felt was gravity. \nBut then you taught me there is so much more to gravity than a fear of falling. \nLet\u2019s consider a two-object system: my pencil and the earth. The earth and my pencil are attracted to each other, so to lift my pencil, to separate it from the earth, I must add energy to the system. That energy is then stored in the field between the pencil and the earth; it is the gravitational potential difference between the pencil on the ground and in its new position. If I let go of my pencil, the potential energy stored in the field becomes kinetic energy, transforming into their mutual motion. \n\u201cIt is not just the earth that pulls the pencil,\u201d you elucidated, \u201cbut also the pencil that pulls the earth.\u201d And so I learned that teetering on the edge of that cliff just moments from falling, I actually held the potential to move the world. \nYou continued, \u201cAnd when would the system store its maximum potential energy? Its maximum ability to do work?\u201d \n\u201cWhen the pencil and the earth are far apart,\u201d I responded. \u201cMaybe at the edge of earth\u2019s atmosphere?\u201d\u201cOnly that far?\u201d you prodded. \nAnd then I understood. The system holds its maximum potential energy when the pencil and the earth are infinitely far apart, when the pencil teeters precariously, separated far from the safety of earth, just as I felt unmoored, separated from my comfortable world. But only when we are infinitely separated from all we know do we hold our maximum potential difference, our maximum ability to do work, our maximum opportunity to move the world. \nThe strenuous but compassionate learning environment you created helped me to heal. Your unwavering expectations showed me stores of strength I didn\u2019t know I had. You did bring me to my mental limit, but you taught me that that\u2019s the whole point. Acquiring new knowledge, by definition, means you are at your limit, and only there can deep learning occur. \nYou gave me the precious gift that all great teachers give: the power to think for myself. And you taught me that power would only be multiplied if I worked over time. \nI left your class so fortified that I enrolled in the notoriously difficult physics major at Princeton, where I worked on physics problems with peers from around the world, in awe that we shared common scientific truths across the planet. I tutored high school students from diverse backgrounds, and it became clear to me that while talent for science is universal, opportunity is not. \nAnd so I joined the Peace Corps, where I teach physics to 670 seventh through tenth graders in a remote village in Guinea, West Africa. With no textbooks, experimental materials, running water, or electricity, all my students face hardships, but the girls are disproportionately disadvantaged by the challenges of extreme poverty. Cooking, cleaning, doing family laundry with a washboard, and getting water from the well, leaves them with less time to study than their male counterparts, and when they find the time they are exhausted. Furthermore, once puberty hits they become vulnerable to early marriage, which usually leads to pregnancy and the end of school. \nSo I try to give them the same gift you gave me during a vulnerable time in my life\u2014the power to think for themselves. Of course no one can remove society\u2019s limits for them in two short years of service. But I actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s our task\u2014it\u2019s theirs. I can however, impart the skills I learned from you. \nI can reveal to them what they are capable of by creating a caring and rigorous learning space. I can demonstrate completely equal treatment of girls and boys in class. I can push the girls to respond to questions rather than sit passively, as is the norm. I can convince the parents of one of my smartest 7th graders that she should continue her studies even though they are marrying her off. I can confidently teach students the concepts you forever engrained in my mind to show the girls and the boys that yes, women can think about hard things. And hopefully illuminating the logic of the physical world around them will illuminate the illogic of the inequitable system they are in, and empower them with the tools they need to change it. \nMr. Rice, I don\u2019t know how many people can honestly say they\u2019d love to take their high school physics class again, but I would eagerly do so. And I suspect I\u2019m not the only one. You left an indelible mark on every one of your students. We left feeling reasonable, cared for, and empowered. \nAt a political moment such as this, I can\u2019t think of a nobler gift to society than arming young people with logic. Endowing them with the courage to jump into, rather than shy away from, complex problems. So on behalf of our nation , thank you for your 37 years of exceptional physics teaching. You\u2019ve guided countless adolescents to stores of power they didn\u2019t know they had. I am eternally grateful to consider myself one of them. \nWith sincerest gratitude, Lisa \nRex Rice is retiring after teaching physics in American public schools for 37 years. He also coached award winning teams for the Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering ( WYSE ) and Tests of Engineering Aptitude, Mathematics and Science ( TEAMS ) competitions. He is a pioneer of the \u201cphysics first\u201d movement and has been active in the reform and improvement of physics education. He is a member of the American Association of Physics Teacher's Physics Master Teacher Leader Taskforce, and serves as President of the American Modeling Teachers Association. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:11:09.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0bafb8f4e34d431748bf784f23e4cfdc687bde66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcTsOZxIRaDKBK3JcNgD0fP1OrDOZTfmyo3UkbbZjgGlHhaxDIpod9kqVVTmnBq0kei3we7X82tYHb0FetC6Ue8WmkXeYF3dkiR98vtJOjb5q2v2eGstynqJTDYpLddrUoMAXZb_jZXg--", "site_full": "blogs.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "http://www.scientificamerican.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Scientific American Blog Posts", "title": "The Domestic Dog is the book we've been waiting for since 1995", "title_full": "The Domestic Dog is the book we've been waiting for since 1995", "published": "2017-10-06T00:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0bafb8f4e34d431748bf784f23e4cfdc687bde66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcTsOZxIRaDKBK3JcNgD0fP1OrDOZTfmyo3UkbbZjgGlHhaxDIpod9kqVVTmnBq0kei3we7X82tYHb0FetC6Ue8WmkXeYF3dkiR98vtJOjb5q2v2eGstynqJTDYpLddrUoMAXZb_jZXg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Julie Hecht", "published": "2017-10-06T00:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Domestic Dog is the book we've been waiting for since 1995", "text": "Featuring two decades of new evidence on dog evolution, behavior, training and human interaction\n\n-- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T01:06:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b67fa007f2e2672072139b54566cdc0fd3d8eb05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5uZPN3X4eW_DhlW3jLrzBfIyELz6MBJkzYBSopSPrGXzrV098l_Dhy1OlxAPg6d6xXebqMwVVW3CUVrjXlBt45l", "site_full": "www.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "http://rss.sciam.com/ScientificAmerican-Global", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Scientific American Content: Global", "title": "When We Fly To Mars, Microbes Will Too", "title_full": "When We Fly To Mars, Microbes Will Too", "published": "2017-10-06T02:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/C51DFFBB-A4B4-45E9-8B6FD61582118488_agenda.jpg?w=600&amp;h=335", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b67fa007f2e2672072139b54566cdc0fd3d8eb05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5uZPN3X4eW_DhlW3jLrzBfIyELz6MBJkzYBSopSPrGXzrV098l_Dhy1OlxAPg6d6xXebqMwVVW3CUVrjXlBt45l", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christopher Intagliata", "published": "2017-10-06T02:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "When We Fly To Mars, Microbes Will Too", "text": "When We Fly to Mars, Microbes Will, Too Subscribe: Print Share via \nThe microbes that live in and on our bodies will colonize a human-manned spacecraft to Mars\u2014but will the spacecraft's microbiome be safe?

And Schwendner and her team tested microbial samples of the habitat over time. They found what you might expect: a lot of human-related bacteria and fungi, mostly at levels deemed safe for life in space. But they also noticed a decline in microbial diversity over time\u2014which could indicate a less-than-healthy microbial community that\u2019s potentially more prone to takeover by hostile bacteria. \n\"Seeing this decrease is for us an important point or proof that continuous monitoring is an important fact and is really required for being able to maintain a healthy environment.\" The study is in the journal Microbiome .

Credit: ALAMY Advertisement \nPsychologist Abraham Maslow's famed \u201chierarchy of needs\u201d says people seek food, shelter and safety before esteem and self-actualization. So what explains foolish dares and violent sports, in which people risk grave injury to pursue respect? New research suggests the hierarchy may be more fluid than we think\u2014many individuals will undergo disgusting or painful ordeals to save their reputations. \nAndy Vonasch, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and his colleagues conducted an online survey of 111 Americans about the value of reputation. Of the respondents, 40 percent said they would choose a year in jail and a clean reputation over no jail and a criminal reputation. Incarceration is directly harmful, but \u201creputation is what helps you gain access to all of the things you want in society,\u201d Vonasch says. In similarly sized surveys, 70 percent of respondents told Vonasch's team they would give up their dominant hand to avoid a swastika face tattoo; 53 percent would choose immediate death over a long life as a suspected child molester; and 30 percent would take immediate death over a long and happy life followed by postmortem rumors of child molestation. This study was released online in July by Social Psychological and Personality Science . \nBut what about the real world? As part of the new study, white college students took a test of implicit racism. Then they chose between having their scores e-mailed widely and putting one hand in a bowl of \u201csuperworms\u201d ( photograph ). People given (falsely) high scores of implicit racism were more likely to choose the superworms (30 versus 4 percent) and were more likely to hold their hands in near-freezing water (63 versus 9 percent)\u2014even though many said they doubted the e-mail threat. \nPeople make all kinds of sacrifices to preserve their honor, from ritual suicide to settling out of court to ceding subway seats.

Because of the bomb\u2019s \u201cpoison\u201d\u2014its radiation effects\u2014the city would be unable to sustain vegetation of any kind.

Suggested here was the idea that the city itself, the habitat of all who dwelled in it, was contaminated beyond the point of sustaining human life. \nThere was also the sense among survivors that the bomb had so altered the natural world that the Americans were capable of further altering it in any imaginable way. Hence rumors that America would mount new attacks with \u201cpoison gases\u201d or \u201cburning oil\u201d; that America, having dropped such a terrible \u201chot bomb,\u201d would next drop a \u201ccold bomb\u201d or \u201cice bomb,\u201d which would simply freeze everything so that everyone would die; and even a rumor that America would drop rotten pigs with the result, as one survivor put it, that \u201ceverything on the earth would decay and go bad.\u201d \nAll of these rumors were related to observed radiation effects, acute and delayed, or what I came to call a fear of invisible contamination\u2014the fear among survivors that the same mysterious, pervasive, and deadly poison that had entered their individual bodies would engulf their entire city. \nAs it turned out, the environment was not permanently destroyed. The appearance of cherry blossoms the following spring even conveyed a partial sense of renewal. That environmental recovery was in keeping with a very different view of nature expressed to me by a survivor who quoted an old Japanese (originally Chinese) saying: \u201cThe state may collapse, but the mountains and rivers remain.\u201d Here the message expressed was that whatever we humans destroy, nature will somehow endure. Though events seemed to confirm this second, more hopeful view, Hiroshima survivors retained feelings that they had come close to experiencing the destruction of everything, to experiencing, as several put it to me, \u201cthe end of the world.\u201d Indeed the desolation expressed by those early post-bomb Hiroshima rumors turned out to anticipate later responses of people everywhere to the interactions of mind and habitat. \nOverall, people in Hiroshima became deeply uncertain about how much one could depend upon the natural world to keep human beings alive. And many people elsewhere, having heard about or encountered images of Hiroshima and the weapon that destroyed it, took on a similar sense of cosmic uncertainty that continues to haunt human beings everywhere. We could not confidently depend upon \u201cnature\u201d to protect us from this new weapon. We learned that, whatever our destructive power, mountains and rivers may indeed remain. \nWhat may not remain, however, are precisely the elements of nature necessary to human life: an atmosphere surrounding the earth that is not overheated, and oceans that are not rendered acidic and dangerous to the land around them. In other words, it is precisely the human habitat, and that of other plant and animal species\u2014just a small part of nature \u2014 that is threatened. The rest of nature will be okay. If our bombs inundate the earth with deadly radiation, or bring about a nuclear winter by creating debris that blocks the rays of the sun, or if our carbon and methane emissions significantly increase climate temperature, then the prevailing mountains and rivers will do little to sustain the life of our species. \nHiroshima and the Ultimate Pollution \nEarly in my work I struggled with the relationship between nuclear threat and danger to our habitat. I completed my Hiroshima study in 1962, and a few years later I wrote most of a talk that I called \u201cHiroshima and the Ultimate Pollution.\u201d I apparently gave the talk on a couple of occasions but had forgotten about it until just a few years ago when my assistant rediscovered it among my papers deposited at the New York Public Library. In the talk I discussed those Hiroshima rumors and their suggestion of our new capacity to destroy, or come close to destroying, our natural world. I spoke of the \u201cbreakdown of ecological balance\u201d and said that we \u201cmust use such terms as \u2018poison,\u2019\u2018deterioration,\u2019\u2018degeneration,\u2019 and \u2018starvation,\u2019\u201d as we are \u201cspeaking of nothing other than death, whether partial, symbolic, or total\u2014and not only death but grotesque and premature death.\u201d I was talking about both nuclear weapons and extreme environmental pollution. And I went on to insist that \u201cto preserve our planet and avoid these deadly breakdowns is to speak of life\u2014not only in the individual person but the life of our species and that of other species as well.\u201d \nI believed that those Hiroshima rumors were prophetic for all of us, possessed a Cassandra-like quality, which we had better heed. The term \u201cglobal warming\u201d was not yet in general use, and I was clearly unaware of the important scientific findings about climate change that had already been recorded. But I was groping for a way of comparing, and finding parallels between, nuclear and climate threats. \nThe \u201cultimate pollution\u201d I referred to\u2014of individual bodies and the atmosphere outside of them\u2014was created by an atomic bomb. \nEcocide \nAround the same time, I and a loosely connected group of activists began to talk about \u201cecocide,\u201d a term we used to suggest large-scale destruction of the environment. Interestingly, we first spoke of ecocide not in relation to nuclear weapons or climate change but to the U.S. military\u2019s use of the herbicide called Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Agent Orange was actually a combination of herbicides, named because of the signature orange stripe across the barrels in which it was stored; it was sprayed widely on vegetation in South Vietnam for the purpose of depriving guerrilla forces of protective terrain. Agent Orange contained benzoic acid and dioxin, and turned out to be extremely harmful not only to plant ecology but to people as well, increasing rates of cancer and causing birth defects, brain disorders, and other grave diseases in Vietnamese and Americans who were exposed to it. \nThe term \u201cecocide\u201d was first used by a friend and colleague at Yale, Arthur Galston, whose relationship to Agent Orange was both tragic and inspiring. Tragic because Galston\u2019s work as a young botanist on a benzoic acid compound was utilized by American military scientists in producing Agent Orange. Inspiring because Galston was deeply troubled by the part his work played in extending war into environmental destruction, spoke often about his sense of guilt and responsibility, and became an extraordinarily articulate antiwar activist who made many trips to Vietnam and China, focusing always on the dangers of Agent Orange. \nIn that way he and other scientists eventually persuaded the American government to end the herbicidal project. I collaborated with him in a number of antiwar activities and observed the passionate intensity of his very personal involvement. His dedicated opposition to the use of the substance he had helped create, and his subsequent work in the new realm of bioethics, gave powerful expression to what I have come to call an animating relation to guilt. What I mean by that is the converting of self-condemnation into the anxiety of responsibility. That in turn can result in considerable achievement. \nAnother friend, Richard Falk, did much to bring the term ecocide into the international legal realm. Falk, an authority on international law, pointed out that American behavior in Vietnam \u201cprovided the first modern case where the environment was selected as a \u2018military\u2019 target appropriate for comprehensive and systematic destruction.\u201d He proposed a U.N. ecocide convention in 1973 that, although not officially accepted, had considerable influence over the years. His proposal was to become a basic document for a contemporary Ecocide Project, a widespread effort to render ecocide an international crime parallel to, and part of, the U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Ecocide, then, has long been my concern, even if I took considerable time to realize its full significance. Without being aware of it, I was undergoing a change in consciousness in connection with the human habitat. That is, I was becoming part of the climate swerve. \nTaking On (or Being Taken On by) Climate Change \nRecently I have wondered at the hiatus between my work on Hiroshima and my concern about climate issues. I remember a conversation I had in 2013 with Jonathan Schell, the most influential of all writers on nuclear issues, about our having both been slow to take up the issue of climate change. We agreed that there was a deep connection between nuclear and climate threats and that climate was the all-enveloping one. Now I wonder whether both of us were not held back by a faith in the ultimate stability of nature, a faith that could cloud the minds of even those who were strongly aware of nuclear threat. I believe that Schell and I were no different from many others in assuming, however unconsciously, that those mountains and rivers would indeed outlast\u2014and perhaps contain\u2014the devastation of nuclear war. \nIn my case I had to be prodded by a friend, a member of the Wellfleet group on psychology and history, who pointed out in 2012 that we had never taken up the subject of climate threat. I had formed the group in 1966, together with Erik Erikson, and had hosted all of its annual meetings in my home in Wellfleet, Massachusetts. We had frequently discussed nuclear weapons, the Vietnam War, and psychological perspectives on various historical events. My friend suggested that we should connect climate change with our ongoing concerns, and that I in particular should have something to say about the issue, just as I had about nuclear threat. I experienced a direct and immediate affirmation, as one does to ideas that make contact with unrealized inclinations of one\u2019s own. Climate change became a central issue of the Wellfleet group, and I began a systematic comparison of climate and nuclear threats, drawing upon past nuclear explorations that I could now see in a somewhat different light. \nIn that way my study of climate change was anchored in previous work. In that earlier research I had made use of extensive psychological interviews with people who had undergone various forms of duress. For instance, my work in Hiroshima was primarily based on in-depth psychological interviews, supplemented with what I call a mosaic approach, an immersion in the historical and cultural forces providing the context for those interviews. But in this and other research, the interviews themselves had been basic to the method; through them people conveyed to me, directly and powerfully, their pain and suffering and their struggles with healing. \nIn going about my climate study, I did not conduct systematic interviews with particular groups of people as in previous research. Rather, I relied on the findings of scientists and knowledgeable observers, and on the recorded experience of survivors of climate events. But I brought to the climate work that longstanding exposure to raw human experience that I had gained through decades of interviews. What people went through in Hiroshima, Auschwitz, and Vietnam had become part of my enduring consciousness and a source of survivor-like feelings that have lasted a lifetime. To be sure, I have been a witnessing professional and not a survivor, but my interview method took me as close to survivor experience as a non-survivor can get. Climate change could never become an abstraction for me. Rather than a theoretical projection of a possible future, I came to see global warming as a source of ever-increasing human suffering. \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Credit: SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN , VOL. CXVII, NO. 15; OCTOBER 13, 1917 Advertisement October 1967 \nShantytowns: Unseen Structure and Evolution \n\u201cThe common view is that the squatters populating the Peruvian shantytowns are Indians from the rural mountains who still speak only the Quechuan language, that they are uneducated, unambitious, disorganized, an economic drag on the nation\u2014and also that they are a highly organized group of radicals who mean to take over and communize Peru's cities. I found that in reality the people of the barriadas around Lima do not fit this description at all. Most of them had been city dwellers for some time (on the average for nine years) before they moved out and organized the barriadas. They speak Spanish (although many are bilingual); indeed, their educational level is higher than that of the general population in Peru. At first glance the barriadas appear to be formless collections of primitive straw shacks. Actually the settlements are laid out according to plans, often in consultation with architectural or engineering students. As time goes on most of the shanties are replaced by more permanent structures.\u201d October 1917 \nVolcano Power \n\u201cIn central Tuscany in 1906, volcanic steam was first used in an ordinary steam engine of about forty horse-power, but the borax salts and other accompanying chemicals seriously corroded the machinery. Then the superheated steam was applied to an ordinary multitubular boiler in which it was used in place of fuel. An experimental plant worked successfully, supplying power to the works and the villages around Lardarello. Its success led Prince Ginori-Conti to develop a power plant on a large scale, and three 3,000-kilowatt turbogenerators were installed in 1916. The new undertaking has proved a great boon in industrial Tuscany, where the present war-price of coal ranges from $40 to $50 per ton.\u201d \nWarhorses \n\u201cLike everything else, horses and mules are found in this war in numbers never before approached. As it has been necessary to exercise greater scrutiny of resources in every direction, it has been essential that the ultimate pound of energy be obtained from every animal, that no mount or beast of burden be permitted to go into the last discard until every expedient to save him has been exhausted. For horses are scarce; no longer can the army chief shoot them or work them to death or turn them off with calm confidence that plenty more are to be had. Rather he must conserve them in every possible way; and so we have the field hospital for horses, illustrated here.\u201d \nMore archive images on the horse in the First World War can be found at www.ScientificAmerican.com/oct2017/warhorse October 1867 \nQuinine for Malaria \n\u201cAmong the many remedial agents which organic chemistry has afforded us, quinine occupies the first place, chloroform the second. Without quinine, large tracts, indeed whole countries, would be simply uninhabitable for Europeans. The \u2018quinine famine\u2019 in the Mauritius demonstrated to thousands how small a thing even gold itself might become in comparison with this lifesaving salt. The search for artificial quinine, though, has been as unsuccessful as that for the Philosopher's Stone. This circumstance has induced certain enterprising men to cause the cinchonas to be introduced into India, and the cinchona plantations in India are now so flourishing that there need be no apprehension of the supply of quinine ever failing.\u201d \nBe Careful What You Wish For \n\u201cWhy should not every house have its telegraphic wire? When gas was first applied to purposes of illumination it was used only in the public buildings and streets, and even now on the continent of Europe it has been introduced but sparingly into private dwellings. Why may not the telegraph wire be extended and diffused as the gas pipe has been? Suppose a network of such wires laid from a central point in the city to the library or sitting room of every dwelling, and an arrangement made for collecting news similar to that controlled by the associated press. Through the wires, then, this news might be instantly communicated to each family. A fire, a murder, a riot, the result of an election, would be simultaneously known in every part of the city. Of course, this would do away with newspapers, but what of that? All things have their day, and why should such ephemeral things as newspapers be an exception to the rule?\u201d \nThis article was originally published with the title \"50, 100 & 150 Years Ago\"

first meeting of the National Space Council By Mike Wall , SPACE.com on October 6, 2017 Share on Facebook Print Share via Vice President Mike Pence delivers opening remarks during the National Space Council's first meeting at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. Credit: NASA Advertisement \nThe Trump administration is committed to sending astronauts to the moon as part of a broader push to prioritize human spaceflight and firm up U.S. dominance in the final frontier, Vice President Mike Pence said. \n\"We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but [also] to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond,\" Pence said today (Oct. 5) at the first meeting of the newly reinstated National Space Council (NSC). \n\"The moon will be a stepping stone, a training ground, a venue to strengthen our commercial and international partnerships as we refocus America's space program toward human space exploration,\" Pence added. [ From Ike to Trump: Presidential Visions for Space Exploration ] \nUnder the previous administration, that stepping stone was much smaller: President Barack Obama had directed NASA to prep for Mars trips by visiting a near-Earth asteroid. In response, the space agency devised a plan to pluck a boulder off a space rock and haul that fragment into orbit around the moon. A new direction? \nYesterday (Oct. 4) was the 60th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1 , which kicked off the Space Age and the Cold War space race. Pence referenced that seminal event during his remarks today, while lamenting a perceived lack of direction in U.S. space policy. \n\"Rather than lead in space, too often, we've chosen to drift,\" he said. \"And, as we learned 60 years ago, when we drift, we fall behind.\" \nAs evidence of this drift, Pence cited the fact that NASA astronauts haven't gone beyond low-Earth orbit since the final Apollo moon mission, in 1972. In addition, he noted, the country has had to pay Russia to ferry U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station since the space shuttle retired in 2011. That service currently costs $76 million per seat. (Two U.S. companies, SpaceX and Boeing, are both developing capsules to take over this taxi service for NASA astronauts; these spacecraft could begin crewed flights next year .) \nPence pledged that the Trump administration, with the help of the NSC, will develop and implement a coherent, long-term U.S. space strategy. \nThat strategy will focus heavily on human spaceflight, economic development and national security, if Pence's words today and in an op-ed published yesterday in The Wall Street Journal are any guide. \n\"We will renew America's commitment to creating the space technology needed to protect national security. Our adversaries are aggressively developing jamming and hacking capabilities that could cripple critical military surveillance, navigation systems and communication networks. In the face of this threat, America must be as dominant in the heavens as it is on Earth,\" Pence wrote in the op-ed . (A subscription is required to read the full piece, but some snippets are available for free at whitehouse.gov .) \n\"We will promote regulatory, technological and educational reforms to expand opportunities for American citizens and ensure that the U.S. is at the forefront of economic development in outer space,\" he added. \"In the years to come, American industry must be the first to maintain a constant commercial human presence in low-Earth orbit, to expand the sphere of the economy beyond this blue marble.\" The first meeting \nThe primacy of these stated goals was reflected in the makeup of the panelists at today's meeting, which was held at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia. (The space shuttle Discovery is on display at Udvar-Hazy, providing a dramatic backdrop.) \nTwo of the three panels consisted of executives of the spaceflight companies SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corp., Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Orbital ATK. The third panel focused on national security and featured retired Navy Adm. James Ellis, the former chief of U.S. Strategic Command; former NASA astronaut and former DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Deputy Director Pamela Melroy; and former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin. \n\"We won the race to the moon half a century ago, and now we will win the 21st century in space,\" Pence said at today's meeting, a full replay of which you can see here . \nThe NSC was last active in the early 1990s, during the presidency of George H.W.

Credit: Richard T. Noswitz Getty Images Advertisement \nPresident Trump's nominee to be second in command at U.S. EPA helped kill bipartisan climate legislation during his time as a top Senate aide. \nAndrew Wheeler, nominated by Trump yesterday to be EPA deputy administrator under Scott Pruitt, spent years as the staff director for the Senate's leading climate skeptic and former Environment and Public Works chairman, Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). \nDuring the George W. Bush administration, the Senate considered a series of bipartisan cap-and-trade climate bills that each sputtered out. \nAs Inhofe's top aide, Wheeler worked behind the scenes to help crush those bills. \nHe helped to push Democratic members away from the climate bills by \u201cexposing economic arguments and the impact in industrial states,\u201d said Matt Dempsey, who worked on the EPW Committee with Wheeler. \n\u201cHe always focused on the economic argument because he understood that to be the winning argument,\u201d Dempsey added. \nUnlike Inhofe, who has long been a vocal critic of mainstream climate science, Dempsey said of Wheeler, \u201cI don't think he dove as strongly into the science.\u201d \nWheeler's denunciation on costs of federal climate policies puts him in line with Pruitt, who has criticized the burden that EPA rules have placed on industry, particularly during the Obama administration. \nInhofe praised the selection of his \u201cclose friend\u201d and former staffer for EPA's No. 2 job. \n\u201cThere is no one more qualified than Andrew to help Scott Pruitt restore EPA to its proper size and scope,\u201d he said in a statement. \nMarc Morano, who also worked with Wheeler on EPW, said of his nomination: \u201cReal institutional reform at the EPA just got a whole lot more real. Climate activists who were hoping some part of Obama's climate 'legacy' was going to survive the Trump presidency have to be very concerned today.\u201d \nIndeed, green groups reacted to the nomination with dismay. \n\u201cHalloween apparently came early this October because the nomination of Andrew Wheeler as Deputy EPA Administrator is absolutely horrifying,\u201d Melinda Pierce, the Sierra Club's legislative director, said in a statement. \nPierce decried Wheeler's record of lobbying for coal companies and his time working for Inhofe, whom she described as \u201cone of the most backward climate science deniers.\u201d \nWheeler was Inhofe's EPW staff director from 2003 until 2009. Several other former Inhofe aides have already landed at EPA, including Pruitt's chief of staff, Ryan Jackson. \nWheeler, an Ohio native, worked for then-Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio); he also worked at EPA in the early 1990s as a special assistant in the agency's toxics office, according to his LinkedIn profile. Coal lobbyist \nIn 2009, Wheeler joined Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting in Washington. He's co-leader of the group's energy and natural resources practice and has lobbied for coal giant Murray Energy Corp., led by vocal Trump supporter Robert Murray. \nMurray declined to comment about Wheeler's potential nomination. \nWheeler's nomination has been expected for months, and some speculated that his lobbying activities slowed down the announcement of his appointment. \nHe was registered as a lobbyist for Murray Energy and several other clients in the first quarter of this year, according to lobbying disclosure reports. He also signed up as a lobbyist for Energy Fuels Resources Corp., a U.S. uranium mining company, in February, according to disclosures. \nHis firm reported in August that he was no longer expected to act as a lobbyist for Murray Energy, Energy Fuels Resources, Sargento Foods Inc. or Underwriters Laboratories. Those appear to have been all the clients for which he was registered to lobby. \nSome members of the coal industry greeted Wheeler's nomination warmly. In a statement yesterday evening, Paul Bailey, the president and CEO of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, called him \"extraordinarily qualified.\" \n\u201cHis understanding of a wide range of environmental policies and the policy development process \u2014 combined with his thoughtfulness, judgment and temperament \u2014 will enable him to be an outstanding Deputy Administrator.\u201d \nThe Trump administration has pledged to bar appointees from working on issues that they lobbied on in the previous two years, but many top officials have been granted waivers. \nWhite House energy official Mike Catanzaro, for example, received a waiver that allows him to work on broad energy and environmental policy issues, like the Clean Power Plan and other issues he focused on as a lobbyist. Catanzaro also worked on Inhofe's EPW staff, joining the committee after Wheeler left in 2009. \nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&E News.

Denis Villeneuve\u2019s sequel to Ridley Scott\u2019s sci-fi masterpiece gets the colour palette just right, perfectly capturing the tone of the original. \nAchieving the look and feel of the original Blade Runner (1982) is essential because appearances, vision and eyes are key to both the experience and the story. \nBlade Runner was ahead of the AI curve when it made sci-fi arguments about identity and philosophy a mainstream concern. Is Deckard a replicant ? Do androids have souls? What makes us human? \nIn the original, seeking answers was all about looking at the eyes. The film\u2019s Voight-Kampff \u201cempathy test\u201d, used by the Blade Runners to identify replicants, now has its own special place in popular culture . The striking image of a glorious blue iris reflecting fire and light has become a cinematic icon; and Rutger Hauer\u2019s emotional final lines when his character, Roy Batty, succumbs to death are a sublime moment in film history: \nI\u2019ve seen things you people wouldn\u2019t believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh\u00e4user Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. \nTime to die. \nAnd now Blade Runner 2049 appears primed to expand the exploration of eyes and identity with mind-bending visuals. In the neon flashes and noirish glimmers, Jared Leto\u2019s character, Niander Wallace, muses on the act of creating replicants like a blind god. His white irises have a sinister and mysterious beauty, but they also belie any sense of limitation caused by his lack of sight\u2014even though he can\u2019t see, he has the \u201cvision\u201d to create or end life. \nDavid Bowie was actually Villeneuve\u2019s first choice for the Niander Wallace role. Seen as an influence upon Blade Runner \u201cin many ways\u201d , the late singer was also well-known for his distinctive mismatched eyes that gave him an otherworldly persona\u2014an affect Leto created in his own way with \u201ccustom made contact lenses that turned his eyes totally opaque\u201d . Eye spy \nCinema has often used eyes as a visual code for character and morality. Traditionally, damaged eyes tend to represent \u201cbaddies\u201d and corruption\u2014suggesting an off-kilter world seen in a dark and dangerous way. The vicious scar Donald Pleasence has around his right eye as a highly memorable Ernst Blofeld in You Only Live Twice (1967) helps to make him an enduring Bond villain. \nThe Oscar winning Chinatown (1974) , meanwhile, is full of cracked lenses, broken glasses and other means of distorting vision\u2014ending with the disturbing shot of Faye Dunaway, as Evelyn Mulwray, with her eye socket blown apart by a bullet. \nAnd as Carl Fogarty in A History of Violence (2005) , Ed Harris relishes showing his scar tissue to the camera as he recalls his eye being ripped out with barbed wire. \nCinema also has its fair share of \u201cold crones\u201d with cataracts setting curses ( Drag Me to Hell ); blind priests who have forsaken their faith (Father Spiletto in The Omen ), and \u201cmutants\u201d with unusual eyes spying on unwitting victims ( The Hills Have Eyes ). \nComputers and robots add a different twist to this psychopathology. The calm red lens of HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) ; Yul Brenner\u2019s blank metallic eyes in Westworld (1973) , and the persistent red dot shining out of Arnie\u2019s silver skull in the original Terminator (1984) all project fear through a sense of the uncanny. \nIf the thought of a non-human consciousness glimpsed through the eye as a \u201cwindow to the soul\u201d is consistently unnerving, it is because instead of a human connection there is something else there entirely: the terror and wonder of the unknown . \nBy contrast, heroes are more likely to benefit from enhanced vision. Christopher Reeve\u2019s Superman (1978) famously has X-ray eyes, while Keanu Reeve\u2019s \u201cNeo\u201d in The Matrix (1999) realises his destiny as \u201cThe One\u201d only when he can visualise the code world and see how to change its rules from within. New look \nBut our changing perception of eyes and how we see them is also visible onscreen. We now have popular blind superheroes like Daredevil, on film (2003) and TV (2015 onwards) , and anti-heroes like Elliot in Mr Robot (2015 onwards) who \u201csees differently\u201d due to a strange combination of dissociative identity disorder and next-level hacker skills. Rami Malek\u2019s starring eyes, somewhere between the unblinking focus of a screen addict and the wide-eyed paranoia of a drug addict, add a mesmeric quality to his performance of Mr Robot\u2019s complex persona. \nBack in Deckard\u2019s increasingly toxic world, it looks like Niander Wallace is set to become an iconic cinematic villain in a film already seen by some as a masterpiece . His cloudy eyes feel well suited to the shadowy undertones of Blade Runner 2049, while his ability to create artificial intelligence offer a dark vision of the future. However bleak an outlook Blade Runner 2049 might visualise, films that look as good as this make it hard to take your eyes off the screen\u2014and offer a glimpse of our future. \nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

They would go on to win the grand prize at the Department of Energy\u2019s National Clean Energy Business Plan Competition in Washington, DC. \nTheir Co-Founder, Thomas Healy, is a former race car driver who found his love for the track when he was just nine years old. With competitions around the country, he became quickly used to following 18-wheelers full of racing gear down long highways. After his parents gave him a hybrid Honda Civic for his off-track car at the age of sixteen, Healy began to wonder: \n\u201c why aren\u2019t tractor trailers using hybrid technology? \u201d \nThis is why, after entering college, Healy led the development of a slide-in suspension system for tractor-trailers that could reduce fuel use in these trucks by up to 30%. With an expected price tag of just $25,000, this fuel savings is all the more impressive. \nThe key to the Hyliion system is an intelligent electric drive axle that can be added to Class 8 trucks in order to reduce fuel use and its associated emissions. It can be retrofitted onto existing vehicles or installed into new ones. The original prototype of the system was built at an off-campus workshop near Carnegie Mellon University where Healy was studying for an engineering degree.

The 2015 Paris climate agreement states that global warming must be limited to a rise in temperature of less than 2\u02daC above pre-industrial levels to avoid the greatest impacts of climate change. This goal has served as a rallying point for global efforts to limit carbon emissions. \nHowever, a comparably clear, agreed target for the amount of natural space that should be conserved to address the biodiversity crisis has been much more elusive. \nThe idea of securing at least half of our planet for nature conservation has recently been gathering momentum. Various studies indicate that achieving this \u201cHalf-Earth\u201d goal\u2014the name given to this endeavor by pre-eminent biologist E. O. Wilson\u2014would help to avoid widespread biodiversity declines and prevent the collapse of vital services provided by ecosystems, such as carbon sequestration and climate regulation. \nUnfortunately, the goal of 50 percent protection of all terrestrial ecosystems far exceeds current global conservation commitments. For example, the plan that is currently accepted by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity has a target of protecting 17 percent of land and freshwater regions and 10 percent of marine areas by 2020. \nThe much greater scale of conservation needed for Half-Earth protection has left many people questioning whether it is even possible given the unrelenting rate of habitat conversion eroding opportunities for large-scale conservation on a daily basis. \nEric Dinerstein and his colleagues have made a first attempt to answer this key ques\u00adtion for land areas, and their findings are both encouraging and disheartening. Writing in BioScience not long ago , they analyzed the current level of ecosystem protection on a global scale. The authors\u2019 data clearly demonstrate that achieving Half-Earth conservation is indeed still possible in many places, but not everywhere. \nThey began by determining which of the earth\u2019s 846 terrestrial ecoregions had at least 50 percent of their natural habitat remaining by studying satellite-derived maps of forest cover, land use patterns, and human occupancy. They found that nearly half of the world\u2019s ecoregions have the remaining habitat necessary to achieve a Half-Earth protection target. Roughly one-eighth of these are already 50 percent protected. \nAbout a quarter of the ecoregions with less than 50 percent of natural habitat remaining (requiring substantial restoration) were described by the Dinerstein team as \u201cin peril,\u201d meaning that they have no more than 20 percent remaining. \nBut by assessing the possibility of achieving Half-Earth conservation, Dinerstein and his colleagues have helped to take the first step towards a road map for implementing such a goal. The authors outline the idea of a \u201cglobal deal for nature,\u201d whereby nations agree to achieving Half-Earth conservation, where possible, by 2050. Such an agreement would offer a biodiversity-focused counterpart to the Paris climate accord. \nWhat is needed now is a clear, science-based plan for the next steps to making Half-Earth conservation a reality. We propose that this plan and the science agenda should be based around three fundamental questions. \nThe first question is in many ways the key question in conservation biology: Which are the most important places to conserve? The answer must take into account both the scale of the Half-Earth undertaking and the immense diversity of conservation objectives being considered. As a start, to halt imminent biodiversity loss, places that are home to the last remaining populations of a species and the last samples of any ecosystem type should be prioritized. \nTo complement these irreplaceable sites, we must also identify and protect places that are still large, intact, and functioning in ways that are unimpeded by large-scale human activities. Such areas represent the places best prepared to allow species and ecosystems to self-regenerate and to adapt to stressors that arise from human activity. \nSecond, what are the scope, severity, and trajectory of the threats to local biodiversity? And what are the processes that sustain those threats? To address these questions, we must understand not only the drivers of habitat loss and degradation, but also the nebulous effects that other factors can have on a habitat\u2014things like invasive species, over-harvesting, disease, climate change, and shifts in the occurrence of natural fires. \nAll of these threats (which can be further influenced by social and economic forces) tend to reduce the quality of a given habitat without necessarily affecting its size. Understanding them helps us assess where action is most urgently needed to conserve and restore habitats. It can further allow conservation efforts to focus on minimizing the number of ecoregions that dip below retention of half of their natural habitat. \nAnd finally, in places that require intervention, what measures will be needed to ensure that they maintain their natural integrity? Although protected areas have been the cornerstone of conservation action so far, they would probably have a reduced role in a conservation network that scales up to the level of Half-Earth. \nCompleting the research required to answer these three questions should provide an effective framework for reaching Half-Earth by 2050. The analysis produced by Dinerstein and colleagues has shown that this goal is possible in many places, and has helped to embolden this call for action. Half-Earth is about thinking big, and we urge conservation scientists to play their part in this process. \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Credit: US ARMY Wikimedia Commons Advertisement \nWhen the U.S. military abandoned Camp Century, a complex of tunnels dug into the ice of northwest Greenland, in the mid-1960s, they left behind thousands of tons of waste, including hazardous radioactive and chemical materials. They expected the detritus would be safely entombed in the ice sheet for tens of thousands of years, buried ever deeper under accumulating layers of snow and ice. \nBut a new study suggests that because of warming temperatures that are driving substantial melting of the ice, that material could be exposed much, much sooner\u2014possibly even by the end of this century\u2014posing a threat to vulnerable local ecosystems. \nThese remnants of the Cold War are also an example of an unanticipated political issue that could arise because of the effects of climate change, particularly as countries seek to establish a presence in the Arctic as warming makes it increasingly accessible. \n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a nice case study for this kind of political tension stemming from climate change,\u201d study author William Colgan , a glaciologist at York University in Toronto, said. What Lies Beneath \nToday, the site of Camp Century, located 125 miles from Greenland\u2019s northwest coast, is \u201cjust blue skies, flat white ice sheet,\u201d Colgan said. \nBut nearly 120 feet below the surface, an estimated 9,000 tons of material sits spread over an area the size of about 100 football fields. That material includes everything from buildings and railways, to tanks of diesel fuel, radioactive coolant, and likely an unknown amount of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). \nCamp Century was known to Colgan and other glaciologists as the site where the first deep ice core was drilled. These cylinders of ice let scientists sample old layers of the ice to better understand the climate of the past. \nBut the base was originally built in 1959 to test the idea of putting an array of ballistic missiles within striking range of Russia, a venture called Project Iceworm. When the project was ultimately rejected, the nuclear reactor that powered the camp was removed and then the site was \u201cabandoned by just closing the door and letting the snow fall,\u201d Colgan said. \nAs he looked up old reports on what was stored there, Colgan said, \u201cthe clear question was, \u2018What\u2019s the implication of climate change?\u2019\u201d Accumulation vs. Melt \nThe answer to that question comes down to the winner of the competition between accumulating snow (which is eventually packed down to become ice) and melt: In the decades since Camp Century was abandoned, falling snows have buried the site ever deeper. But because of rising temperatures, eventually that process is \u201cgoing to stop and then reverse direction,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cYou\u2019re inevitably going to expose the site.\u201d \nBetween 2007 and 2011, the Greenland Ice Sheet lost about 260 billion tons of ice per year, mostly due to melt. Even more ice loss is predicted as temperatures continue to rise due to the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \nTo gauge the threat of future melt at the Camp Century site, Colgan and his colleagues turned to climate models. They found that if greenhouse gases continue to be emitted at the pace they\u2019re currently on, melt could outpace the accumulation of snow there as early as 2090. Their findings were published Aug. 4 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. \nMeltwater, which percolates down through the top layers of compressed snow, could reach the site and its hazardous material even sooner. \nOf particular worry are the PCBs thought to be buried there. These chemicals naturally accumulate in colder conditions, and can work their way up the food chain. There has already been clear bioaccumulation in the Arctic, with elevated levels found in native populations that eat seal and whale meat. \n\u201cThey last forever; they don\u2019t break down,\u201d Colgan said. They \u201cwill be waiting\u201d when meltwater comes, and will be washed out to coastal waters. Political Fallout \nColgan and his colleagues say that remediation of Camp Century is impractical right now, and would have to wait until warming brings it closer to the surface. \nBut it does point to larger, heavily political issues: Who is responsible for the cleanup of this and other sites, and how should waste disposal be handled moving forward, as the Arctic becomes increasingly developed ? \n\u201cThe study raises an important issue, how climate change can result in unanticipated release into the environment of toxic and radioactive wastes that were optimistically presumed at the time to be stably isolated,\u201d Daniel Hirsch , director of the Program on Environmental and Nuclear Policy at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said in an email. That concern extends beyond the Arctic to include sites that could be impacted by sea level rise. \n\u201cPlaces that are frozen today may not remain frozen tomorrow; places that are fairly dry now may not be so over the half million years which radioactive wastes remain dangerous,\u201d Hirsch, who was not involved with the study, said. \nWho is responsible for remediation is a potentially thorny problem. Camp Century, for example, was a U.S. military project undertaken with permission from the Danish government, which controlled Greenland at the time. Today, Greenland is self-governing. Effective cleanup could impact the willingness of Arctic nations to hosts such bases. \nWith increased interest in the Arctic from countries including the U.S., Russia, and China, \u201chow we deal with Camp Century and its sister bases is an important precedent to set,\u201d Colgan said. \nThis article is reproduced with permission from Climate Central .

Could birth control be to blame for some of these breakups? Recent research suggests that the contraceptive pill\u2014which prevents women from ovulating by fooling their body into believing it is pregnant\u2014could affect which types of men women desire. Going on or off the pill during a relationship, therefore, may tempt a woman away from her man. \nIt\u2019s all about scent. Hidden in a man\u2019s smell are clues about his major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, which play an important role in immune system surveillance. Studies suggest that females prefer the scent of males whose MHC genes differ from their own, a preference that has probably evolved because it helps offspring survive: couples with different MHC genes are less likely to be related to each other than couples with similar genes are, and their children are born with more varied MHC profiles and thus more robust immune systems. \nA study published in August in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , however, suggests that women on the pill undergo a shift in preference toward men who share similar MHC genes. The female subjects were more likely to rate these genetically similar men\u2019s scents (via a T-shirt the men had worn for two nights) as pleasant and desirable after they went on the pill as compared with before. Although no one knows why the pill affects attraction, some scientists believe that pregnancy\u2014or in this case, the hormonal changes that mimic pregnancy\u2014draws women toward nurturing relatives. \nWomen who start or stop taking the pill, then, may be in for some relationship problems. A study published last year in Psychological Science found that women paired with MHC-similar men are less sexually satisfied and more likely to cheat on their partners than women paired with MHC-dissimilar men. So a woman on the pill, for example, might be more likely to start dating a MHC-similar man, but he could ultimately leave her less sexually satisfied. Then if she goes off the pill during the relationship, the accompanying hormonal changes will draw her even more strongly toward more MHC-dissimilar men. These immune genes may have a \u201cpowerful effect in terms of how well relationships are cemented,\u201d says University of Liverpool psychologist Craig Roberts, co-author of the August paper. \nNote: This article was originally published with the title, \"A Tough Pill to Swallow\". \nThis article was originally published with the title \"A Tough Pill to Swallow\" ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T08:51:02.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38a4e7d6a65687b1580ecff55e04e69c5c655108", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnMlk5ynU87YaKA0XDV3tOLEDuC_5aXQRBk9EEmWy3LEtJPPwbLEqqcOBQBaL5JCxDw--", "site_full": "www.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Fracking Can Contaminate Drinking Water - Scientific American", "title_full": "Fracking Can Contaminate Drinking Water - Scientific American", "published": "2017-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.253, "main_image": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/F41EA385-15AF-407C-9DDDEE4069EF26F8_agenda.jpg?w=600&amp;h=335", "performance_score": 8, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 873, "comments": 0, "shares": 873}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 77}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "38a4e7d6a65687b1580ecff55e04e69c5c655108", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnMlk5ynU87YaKA0XDV3tOLEDuC_5aXQRBk9EEmWy3LEtJPPwbLEqqcOBQBaL5JCxDw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gayathri Vaidyanathan Climatewire", "published": "2017-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fracking Can Contaminate Drinking Water - Scientific American", "text": "Environment Fracking Can Contaminate Drinking Water It took nearly a decade, but former EPA scientist Dominic DiGiulio has proved that fracking has polluted groundwater in Wyoming By Gayathri Vaidyanathan , ClimateWire on April 4, 2016 Share on Facebook Credit: Education Images / Contributor via Getty Images Advertisement \nFormer EPA scientist Dominic DiGiulio never gave up. \nEight years ago, people in Pavillion, Wyo., living in the middle of a natural gas basin, complained of a bad taste and smell in their drinking water. U.S. EPA launched an inquiry, helmed by DiGiulio, and preliminary testing suggested that the groundwater contained toxic chemicals. \nThen, in 2013, the agency suddenly transferred the investigation to state regulators without publishing a final report. \nNow, DiGiulio has done it for them. \nHe published a comprehensive, peer-reviewed study last week in Environmental Science and Technology that suggests that people\u2019s water wells in Pavillion were contaminated with fracking wastes that are typically stored in unlined pits dug into the ground. \nThe study also suggests that the entire groundwater resource in the Wind River Basin is contaminated with chemicals linked to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. \nThis production technique, which involves cracking shale rock deep underground to extract oil and gas, is popular in the United States. It\u2019s also controversial. There are thousands of wells across the American West and in California that are vulnerable to the kind of threat documented in the study, DiGiulio said. He is now a research scholar at Stanford University. \n\u201cWe showed that groundwater contamination occurred as a result of hydraulic fracturing,\u201d DiGiulio said in an interview. \u201cIt contaminated the Wind River formation.\u201d \nThe findings underscore the tension at the heart of the Obama administration\u2019s climate change policy, which is based on replacing many coal-fired power plants with facilities that burn cleaner natural gas. \nThat reliance on natural gas has sometimes blinded agencies to local pollution and health impacts associated with the resource, said Rob Jackson, an earth scientist at Stanford and co-author of the study. In 2015, EPA said in a controversial draft study that hydraulic fracturing has not had \u201cwidespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States\u201d ( Greenwire , June 4, 2015). \n\u201cThe national office of EPA has tended to downplay concerns of their own investigators, in part because the Obama administration has promoted natural gas,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cNatural gas is here to stay. It behooves us to make it as safe and environmentally friendly as possible.\u201d \nEPA spokeswoman Julia Valentine said the agency hasn\u2019t yet finalized its assessment that natural gas has no \u201cwidespread, systemic impacts.\u201d As part of that process, the agency will evaluate all recent research, including DiGiulio\u2019s study, she said. \nEncana Corp., the company that operated in the Pavillion basin, said repeated testing has shown people\u2019s water wells are safe for consumption. \n\u201cAfter numerous rounds of testing by both the state of Wyoming and EPA, there is no evidence that the water quality in domestic wells in the Pavillion Field has changed as a result of oil and gas operations; no oil and gas constituents were found to exceed drinking water standards in any samples taken,\u201d said Doug Hock, an Encana spokesman. Labs can\u2019t see fracking chemicals \nWater testing began in 2009 when the local EPA office responded to complaints from residents. EPA headquarters, and DiGiulio, got involved in January 2010. \n\u201cConducting a groundwater investigation related to fracking is extremely complicated,\u201d DiGiulio said. \u201cIt is difficult because a lot of the compounds used for hydraulic fracturing are not commonly analyzed for in commercial labs.\u201d \nThese labs were originally set up for the Superfund program, under which EPA cleans up the most contaminated sites in the nation. They are great at detecting chemicals found at Superfund sites but not as good at detecting chemicals used in fracking, DiGiulio said. \n\u201cYou have some of these very water-soluble exotic compounds in hydraulic fracturing, which were not amenable to routine lab-type analysis,\u201d he said. \nOne such chemical was methanol. The simplest alcohol, it can trigger permanent nerve damage and blindness in humans when consumed in sufficient quantities. It was used in fracking in Pavillion as workers pumped thousands of gallons of water and chemicals at high pressure into the wells they were drilling. About 10 percent of the mixture contained methanol, DiGiulio said. \nSo the presence of methanol in the Pavillion aquifer would indicate that fracking fluid may have contaminated it. But methanol degrades rapidly and is reduced within days to trace amounts. Commercial labs did not have the protocol to detect such small traces, so DiGiulio and his colleagues devised new procedures, using high-performance liquid chromatography, to detect it. They devised techniques for detecting other chemicals, as well. \nBy then, Pavillion was roiling in controversy as EPA and residents collided with industry. EPA had drilled two monitoring wells, MW01 and MW02, in 2011, and its testing had found benzene, diesel and other toxic chemicals. But these results were contested by oil and gas industry representatives, who criticized EPA\u2019s sampling techniques ( EnergyWire , Oct. 12, 2012). They pointed to a technical disagreement between EPA and the U.S. Geological Survey on the best methods to cast doubt on EPA\u2019s overall findings. \nEPA realized it needed a consensus on its water testing methodology. In February 2012, it assembled a technical team from the USGS, Wyoming state regulators and tribal representatives from the Wind River Indian Reservation. They retested the monitoring wells in April 2012. \nThis time, they also tested for methanol. But EPA never released those results to the public. In 2013, the agency backed out of its investigation in Pavillion, handing it over to state regulators, who moved forward using a $1.5 million grant from Encana ( EnergyWire , June 21, 2013). DiGiulio said the decision had come from EPA\u2019s senior management. Methanol, diesel and salt \nIndustry representatives repeatedly pointed out that EPA had not published a peer-reviewed study on its findings. \n\u201cIf the EPA had any confidence in its draft report, which has been intensely criticized by state regulators and other federal agencies, it would proceed with the peer review process,\u201d Steve Everley, a spokesman for Energy in Depth, an industry group, said at the time. \u201cBut it\u2019s not, which says pretty clearly that the agency is finally acknowledging the severity of those flaws and leaning once again on the expertise of state regulators.\u201d \nIn December 2015, state regulators published a draft of their findings. It stated that fracking had not contributed to pollution in Pavillion, according to the Casper Star Tribune . The report said the groundwater is generally suitable for people to use. \nWhen DiGiulio retired from EPA in 2014, he trained his sights on Pavillion. He felt he had to finish his work. \n\u201cEPA had basically handed the case over and a peer-reviewed document was never finalized,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is not in the peer-reviewed literature, then it presents a problem with credibility in terms of findings. It is important that the work be seen by other scientists and enter the peer review realm so that other scientists will have access to virtually everything.\u201d \nSince 2012, a trove of new data had accumulated from USGS, EPA and state regulators. He obtained EPA\u2019s methanol testing results through a Freedom of Information Act request and downloaded the rest of the information from the Wyoming oil and gas regulator\u2019s website. All of it was publicly available, waiting for the right person to spend a year crunching the information. \nThe end result: a peer-reviewed study that reaffirms EPA\u2019s findings that there was something suspicious going on in Pavillion. More research is needed. \nThe sampling wells contained methanol. They also contained high levels of diesel compounds, suggesting they may have been contaminated by open pits where operators had stored chemicals, DiGiulio said. \nThe deep groundwater in the region contained high levels of salt and anomalous ions that are found in fracking fluid, DiGiulio said. The chemical composition suggests that fracking fluids may have migrated directly into the aquifer through fractures, he said. \nEncana had drilled shallow wells at Pavillion, at depths of less than 2,000 feet and within reach of the aquifer zone, said Jackson of Stanford University. \n\u201cThe shallow hydraulic fracturing is a potential problem because you don\u2019t need a problem with well integrity to have chemicals migrate into drinking water,\u201d he said. \nThe study also shows that there is a strong upward flow of groundwater in the basin, which means contamination that is deep underground could migrate closer to the surface over time. \n\u201cRight now, we are saying the data suggests impacts, which is a different statement than a definitive impact,\u201d DiGiulio said. \u201cWe are saying the dots need to be connected here, monitoring wells need to be installed.\u201d Shallow wells are prevalent \nEPA came to the same conclusion in a blistering response last week to Wyoming\u2019s draft findings. \n\u201cMany of our recommendations suggest that important information gaps be filled to better support conclusions drawn in the report, and that uncertainties and data gaps be discussed in the report,\u201d said Valentine, the EPA spokeswoman. \nThe state had tested people\u2019s water wells and detected 19 concerning chemicals. But regulators had concluded that only two chemicals exceeded safe limits and the water could be used for domestic purposes. EPA disagreed. Nearly half the 19 chemicals are unstudied, and scientists do not know the safe level of exposure, EPA stated. \nKeith Guille, spokesman for Wyoming\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality, declined to comment on DiGiulio\u2019s study and on EPA\u2019s response to the state\u2019s draft report. The state is finalizing its findings and has its eyes set on the future, he said. \n\u201cWe are not done yet,\u201d Guille said. \nEnergy in Depth, the industry group that had earlier criticized EPA for not publishing a peer-reviewed study, said that DiGiulio\u2019s study is \u201ca rehash of EPA\u2019s old, discredited data by the very researcher who wrote EPA\u2019s original report.\u201d \nJackson stressed that the contamination seen at Pavillion could occur in other states where, according to a study published last year in Environmental Science & Technology on which he was the lead author, fracking sometimes occurs at shallow depths. That includes the Rocky Mountain region, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana and California. At present, no state has restrictions on how shallowly a company can frack, he said. \n\u201cShallow hydraulic fracturing is surprisingly common, especially in the western U.S.,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHere in California, half of the wells are fracked shallower than about 2,000 feet.\u201d \nGiven the threat, fracking deserves much greater scrutiny than it has so far received from the Obama administration, said Hugh MacMillan, a scientist with the environmental group Food and Water Watch. \n\u201cCommunities have never argued that every well goes bad; they\u2019ve argued that when you drill and [are] fracking thousands, too many go bad,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those living on groundwater, it becomes a matter of luck, and that\u2019s not right, because over years, more and more people\u2019s luck runs out.\u201d \nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from Environment & Energy Publishing, LLC. www.eenews.net , 202-628-6500 ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "digiulio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guille", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pavillion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug hock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugh macmillan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gayathri vaidyanathan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic digiulio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith guille", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve everley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valentine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julia valentine", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "epa", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "encana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environment & energy publishing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "encana corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energywire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental science & technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental science and technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usgs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of environmental quality", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food and water watch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casper star tribune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook credit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images advertisement  former epa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pavillion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pavillion field", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyo.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "climatewire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rocky mountain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wind river basin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T11:20:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "04851d08b68531c23ff02e503b1a28f725b24b44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcTsOZxIRaDKBK3JcNgD0fP1OrDOZTfmz3w7QT03QWY95MPqb0tkGhHCWdLJN90.I3RhNsBAAIkUThwcR7AEytMDC_78GcPVzrjb63sT4Chw--", "site_full": "blogs.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "http://www.scientificamerican.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Scientific American Blog Posts", "title": "The Astronomical Genius of the Inca", "title_full": "The Astronomical Genius of the Inca", "published": "2017-10-07T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 102, "comments": 0, "shares": 102}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "04851d08b68531c23ff02e503b1a28f725b24b44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcTsOZxIRaDKBK3JcNgD0fP1OrDOZTfmz3w7QT03QWY95MPqb0tkGhHCWdLJN90.I3RhNsBAAIkUThwcR7AEytMDC_78GcPVzrjb63sT4Chw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-07T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Astronomical Genius of the Inca", "text": "The Astronomical Genius of the Inca They were master builders, but their structures often had an intimate connection to the heavens By Sanjana Dugar on October 7, 2017 Share on Facebook Print Share via A window at Intimachay, part of the Macchu Picchu complex, is actually a guide to the seasons. Credit: Bobistraveling Flickr (CC BY-SA 2.0) Advertisement \nWhen I walked off the plane in Cuzco, Peru, en route to the Sacred Valley of the Incan Empire, I didn\u2019t realize I would be entering one of the most culturally rich societies in the history of the world. You wouldn\u2019t know it by the scene immediately outside of the airport: it looked like any other developing nation, with small, rundown buildings and battered cars clogging up pedestrian-lined roads. \nThree hours away, however, lay the ruins of a civilization that had been astonishingly sophisticated before European Conquistadors arrived in the 16 th century to destroy it. My preconceived notion, based on what I\u2019d learned in school, was that the Quechuan people (the commoners of the Incan Empire) were no more than highly skilled builders in stone. But as a guide explained the logic of the Pisac Sun Temple to me, I began to understand how wrong I\u2019d been. They were extraordinary builders, yes, but the structures they built also incorporated their deep knowledge of the heavens. \nThe Sun Temple sits atop a series of stone terraces\u2014huge step-like earthen structures, built for farming purposes and kept in place by stone walls to keep them from washing down the mountainside. Once you climb them (which is more difficult than you\u2019d expect, thanks to an elevation of almost 3,000 meters where the air doesn\u2019t have much oxygen), you arrive at what looks like little more than a series of stone piles. \nIn reality, they are so much more. The Inca\u2014the supreme ruler of the empire\u2014specifically created this structure to signal to his people when the seasons changed, so they\u2019d know when to plant, harvest, and store. When the sun hits a particular large, white stone, the winter solstice has arrived. When it shines through the twin peaks of a neighboring mountain that vaguely resembles a condor (a sacred animal for the Quechuan people, representing the journey to the afterlife), it is the fall equinox, or harvesting time. When it hits the other side of the white stone, it is the summer solstice\u2014time to plant. And in such a manner, what appears to be an arbitrary structure of rocks actually becomes the Sun Temple, the device by which the Inca were able to pace their planting seasons and provide food for an entire population. The Sun Temple: terraces on the side were used for agriculture, but the rock pile on top is actually a sophisticated observatory. Credit: Dennis Jarvis Flickr (CC BY-SA 2.0) \nFor many years, scientists were unconvinced that the Sun Temple and other structures throughout the empire were especially accurate. But in 2013, a Polish-Peruvian research team, led by Mariusz Ziolkowski of University of Warsaw, Jacek Ko\u015bciuk of Wroclaw University of Technology, and Fernando Astete, regional director of Machu Picchu published a study in the journal Anthropological Notebooks that proved otherwise. Using a 3D laser-scanning technique, the team tested the predictive power of Intimachay, a site at Machu Picchu. Intimachay resembles a cave of sorts, hidden under towering piles of stone, which has windows located on all four sides that let in sunlight during specific times of the year. \nPrevious researchers had discovered, for example, that sunlight entered the back wall of Intimachay through the Eastern Window ten days before and after the winter solstice, suggesting an astronomical connection. But this research was deemed inconclusive. But with their more sophisticated technology, Ziolkowski, Koscuik, and Astete confirmed their predecessors\u2019 conclusion that parts of Machu Picchu were used as astronomical observatories. \nOther parts of Intimachay, divided into sections named after the four cardinal directions, could also be used to identify the summer solstice and autumn and spring equinoxes. For example, the scientists found that during the summer solstice, the beams of the rising sun would enter Intimachay through the Northern Window and light up the tunnel wall. In the words of Ziolkowski and his colleagues, these discoveries proved that the Incas\u2019 ability to track the seasons were \u201cfar more complex and precise than was previously believed.\u201d \nThese season markers were far more important to the Inca than we can imagine. Although they lacked telescopes, clocks or any sort of modern technology, they knew enough to build structures that told an entire empire of twelve million people when to farm, to harvest, to shelter crops from coming rains, to hold religious celebrations, and so much more. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that without Intimachay and other buildings throughout the empire the mountain farming that sustained their people would have been significantly less reliable\u2014a crucial factor that potentially could have stymied the growth of the empire. \nSo you can see that when I walked off that plane thinking that the Inca civilization was just another group of ancient people with little more than impressive construction skills, I was far from the truth. Standing atop Machu Picchu, I was looking at the work of people who were remarkable astronomers as well. \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Indeed, China has likely stolen more secrets from businesses and governments than any other country. \nCovert espionage is the main Chinese cyberthreat to the U.S. While disruptive cyberattacks occasionally come from China, those that cause overt damage, like destroying data or causing power outages, are more common from the other top state threats , namely Russia , Iran and North Korea . \nBut Chinese cyberaggression toward the U.S. has been evolving. Before their espionage became a serious threat, Chinese hackers were conducting disruptive cyberattacks against the U.S. and other countries. Hackers unite \nChinese hackers were among the first to come together in defense of their country. Their first operation against the U.S. occurred in 1999 during the Kosovo conflict, when the U.S. inadvertently bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese reporters. The patriotic hackers planted messages denouncing \u201c NATO\u2019s brutal action \u201d on several U.S. government websites. \nChinese hackers struck the U.S. again in 2001 after a Chinese fighter plane collided with a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft . The midair collision killed the Chinese pilot and led to the forced landing and detention of the American crew. Both Chinese and American hackers responded with disruptive cyberattacks , with the Chinese hackers defacing thousands of U.S.-based websites, including the White House site. \nWhat is especially important about this incident, though, is what happened next. The People\u2019s Daily, China\u2019s Communist Party newspaper, issued an editorial decrying the attack against the White House. The paper called it, and the other attacks, \u201c web terrorism \u201d and \u201cunforgivable acts violating the law.\u201d On the anniversary of the incident in 2002, the government asked Chinese hackers to forgo further attacks against U.S.-based sites. They complied. \nThat was the last big cyberattack from Chinese patriotic hackers against the U.S. While Russia seems to condone, if not outright encourage or even sponsor , its patriotic hackers, China has taken a stance against that sort of activity, at least with respect to U.S.-based sites. Targets at home \nIn addition to reining in its patriotic hackers, China appears to have refrained from conducting cyberattacks that cause overt damage to critical infrastructure in other countries, like the Russians did to Ukraine\u2019s power grid . However, it has used disruptive cyberattacks to help enforce censorship policies within its own borders. \nThe Chinese government\u2019s \u201c Great Firewall \u201d keeps internet users in China from accessing censored foreign sites such as those that advocate Tibetan autonomy. Users\u2019 traffic is filtered based on domain names, internet addresses and keywords in web addresses. \nChinese hackers have also used denial-of-service attacks to temporarily take out sites whose activity the government wants to block. These attacks overwhelm target servers with large amounts of activity, preventing others from using the sites and often knocking the servers offline. \nBack in 1999, the government launched DoS attacks against foreign websites associated with Falun Gong , a spiritual movement banned in China. Then in 2011, a Chinese military TV program showed software tools being used in possible cyberattacks against Falun Gong sites in the U.S. The tools were developed by the Electrical Engineering University of China\u2019s armed forces, the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \nMore recently, in 2015, U.S. and other foreign users visiting sites running analytics software from the Chinese search engine provider Baidu unwittingly picked up malware . The malicious code was injected into traffic going back to the users by a device collocated with the Great Firewall. The malware then launched DDoS attacks against GreatFire.org , a site that helps Chinese users evade censorship, and the Chinese language edition of The New York Times. Espionage at the forefront \nBy 2003, China\u2019s interest in cyberespionage was apparent: A series of cyberintrusions that U.S. investigators code-named \u201c Titan Rain \u201d was traced back to computers in southern China. The hackers, believed by some to be from the Chinese army , had invaded and stolen sensitive data from computers belonging to the U.S. Department of Defense, defense contractors and other government agencies. \nTitan Rain was followed by a rash of espionage incidents that originated in China and were given code names like \u201c Byzantine Hades ,\u201d\u201c GhostNet \u201d and \u201c Aurora .\u201d The thieves were after a wide range of data. \nThey stole intellectual property, including Google\u2019s source code and designs for weapons systems . They took government secrets, including user names and passwords. And they compromised data associated with Chinese human rights activists, including their email messages. Typically, the intrusions started with spear-phishing . \nIn 2013, the American cyberintelligence firm Mandiant, now part of FireEye, issued a landmark report on a Chinese espionage group it named \u201c Advanced Persistent Threat 1.\u201d According to the report, APT1 had stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations since 2006. \nThe Mandiant report gave details of the operations and provided evidence linking those thefts to Unit 61398 of the People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2013 and named five officers of the unit. This was the first time any security firm had publicly disclosed data tying a cyberoperation against the U.S. to a foreign government. In 2014, the U.S. indicted the five Chinese officers for computer hacking and economic espionage. \nMandiant described APT1 as \u201cone of more than 20 APT groups with origins in China.\u201d Many of these are believed to be associated with the government. A report from the nonprofit Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology describes 15 state-sponsored advanced persistent threat groups, including APT1 and two others associated with PLA units. The report does not identify sponsors for the remaining groups. The Five-Year Plan \nAccording to the institute, China\u2019s espionage supports the country\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan (covering the years 2016 to 2020), which calls for technology innovations and socioeconomic reforms. The goal is \u201c innovative, coordinated, green, open and inclusive growth .\u201d The ICIT report said most of the technology needed to realize the plan will likely be acquired by stealing trade secrets from companies in other countries. \nIn its 2015 Global Threat Report , the American cyberintelligence firm CrowdStrike identified dozens of Chinese adversaries targeting business sectors that are key to the Five-Year Plan. It found 28 groups going after defense and law enforcement systems alone. Other sectors victimized worldwide included energy, transportation, government, technology, health care, finance, telecommunications, media, manufacturing and agriculture. \nChina\u2019s theft of military and trade secrets has been so rampant that editorial cartoonists Jeff Parker and Dave Granlund depicted it as \u201cChinese takeout.\u201d US-China agreement \nIn September 2015, President Obama met with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping to address a range of issues affecting the two countries. With respect to economic espionage, they agreed that their governments would not conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of business secrets that would provide competitive advantage to their commercial sectors. They did not agree to restrict government espionage, a practice that countries generally consider to be fair game. \nIn June 2016, FireEye reported that since 2014 there had been a dramatic drop in cyberespionage from 72 suspected China-based groups. FireEye attributed the reduction to several \u201cfactors including President Xi\u2019s military and political initiatives, the widespread exposure of Chinese cyberoperations, and mounting pressure from the U.S. Government.\u201d The ICIT believes China may also be asserting greater control over its operatives and focusing on unspecified high-priority targets. \nThe U.S.-China agreement also calls for the two countries to cooperate in fighting cybercrime. Just weeks after the deal was signed, China announced it had arrested hackers connected with the 2015 intrusions into the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s database. Those had exposed highly sensitive personal and financial data of about 22 million federal employees seeking security clearances. The Washington Post observed that the arrests could \u201cmark the first measure of accountability for what has been characterized as one of the most devastating breaches of U.S. government data in history.\u201d \nThe cyberthreat to the U.S. from China is mostly one of espionage, and even that threat seems to be declining. Nevertheless, companies need to be wary of losing their data, not just to China, but to any country or group seeking to profit from U.S. trade secrets and other sensitive data.

Credit: Jami430 Wikimedia ( CC BY-SA 4.0 ) Advertisement \nMany of the monkeys living on Cayo Santiago, an island off Puerto Rico, are likely to have survived Hurricane Maria, which pummeled the island on 20 September. But the storm\u2019s aftermath has left the island\u2019s more than 1,500 rhesus macaques \u2014including some used for autism research\u2014in jeopardy. \nMaria\u2019s 155-mile-per-hour winds leveled a field station, stripped trees of their leaves and destroyed feeding corrals and rainwater collection systems. Without a working water system and the shade provided by trees, the animals could perish in the hot sun. \nResearchers have launched a fundraising campaign to rebuild the water system and deliver critical supplies to the island, which sits half a mile off the coast of Punta Santiago, a town on Puerto Rico\u2019s eastern shore. There is still no power, and field station employees need everything from solar panels to infant formula for their babies. \n\u201cI can describe the situation at Punta Santiago and Cayo Santiago as catastrophic, total destruction, devastating and apocalyptic,\u201d says Angelina Ruiz Lambides , associate director of the University of Puerto Rico\u2019s Cayo Santiago Field Station. \u201cI know we will rebuild, but what we are all going through in Puerto Rico is something like never before.\u201d Treasure island: \nKnown as \u2018Monkey Island,\u2019 Cayo Santiago is considered a research treasure. Since the 1950s, scientists have monitored every monkey on the island, recording observations on the animals\u2019 parenting skills, cognition and social-emotional reactions, including response to death . The field station hosts researchers and students working on 10 research projects, including ones focused on autism. \nStaff and researchers have reported that there are at least 500 surviving monkeys, a number that includes some from each of the six social groups that the monkeys maintain on the island. They say they have not seen dead monkeys, which would indicate mass casualties. \u201cSomehow, monkeys are good at surviving a calamitous event,\u201d says Michael Platt , professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. \nPlatt has been doing research on the island since 2007. He is investigating how naturally occurring genetic variants in the monkeys affect social behavior. About one in eight monkeys on the island has a naturally occurring variant in SHANK3 , a gene mutated in roughly 1 percent of people with autism. Platt and his team have identified monkeys with eight other genetic variants associated with autism. \nA complete census of the monkeys post-hurricane is underway. Platt says he was heartened to see the distinctive face of 42L, a large female who is one of the least social monkeys. He hasn\u2019t sequenced her genome yet, so he can\u2019t say what genes underlie her aberrant social behavior. After the storm: \nField station employees would ordinarily be conducting an annual monkey census at this time of year. This involves taking blood samples and tattooing 1-year-old monkeys. Instead, the employees are focused on keeping the monkeys fed and rebuilding the water system. Platt calls it \u201cfull-on crisis response mode.\u201d \nA shipment of monkey chow, some of it slated for the monkeys on Cayo Santiago, was stuck on a boat in San Juan for several days after the storm. It couldn\u2019t be unloaded because of damage to roads and vehicles and a shortage of fuel. It was finally delivered to the University of Puerto Rico\u2019s other primate center, the Sabana Seca Field Station, located outside of San Juan, on 2 October. The food for the Cayo Santiago monkeys has to yet to make it to the island, but the monkeys still have some food from an earlier shipment. \nThe researchers have launched GoFundMe campaigns to support field station staff , at least one of whom lost his home, and to help the monkeys ; they have so far raised $55,000. \n\u201cI am waiting to hear what else I can do,\u201d says Katalin Gothard , a neurophysiologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, who does not work on the island but donated to the campaign because of her interest in monkey models for autism. The Cayo Santiago colony is \u201can absolutely critical resource for autism research,\u201d she says. \nPlatt plans to travel to Puerto Rico within the next month, when he feels he will be more of an asset than a liability. He also plans to rework a grant application to the National Institutes of Health to examine how Hurricane Maria affects mental health among female monkeys and their children.

There are many websites, blogs, and Facebook groups for people with hypothyroidism that insist that you have to go gluten-free. Is this true?\u201d Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. It\u2019s an auto-immune condition in which the body\u2019s immune system gradually destroys the thyroid gland. As a result, the amount of circulating thyroid hormone in your body is too low. This can lead to everything from weight gain to hair loss to heart trouble. If your doctor diagnoses you with Hashimoto\u2019s, he or she will likely tell you it\u2019s not that a big deal. They\u2019ll write you a prescription for replacement thyroid hormone and send you on your way. If you ask about whether there\u2019s anything you should be doing in terms of diet or lifestyle, they will probably tell you there isn\u2019t.

It\u2019s a workhorse of mathematics: the solution to optimization problems, a source of periodic functions, one of the most perfectly symmetric shapes we can draw, and the habitat for the roots of unity that give this blog its name. But it\u2019s also basic. When babies and toddlers are learning their shapes, their books \u2014 the ones that are made of non-toxic, waterproof materials because they\u2019re being chewed on as much as they\u2019re being read \u2014 have circles in them. The circle is up there with the names of letters, numbers, and colors as a formative piece of how they will start to make sense of the world. \nMathematicians often call the circle the 1-dimensional sphere, or S 1 . It\u2019s defined to be the set of points in the plane that lie exactly 1 unit away from a central point, (0,0), or the origin. (To be more careful, this is the unit circle . In general, a circle can be any size and lie anywhere in the plane.) We can easily describe it as the set of points (x,y) that satisfy the equation x 2 +y 2 =1. You can draw one using a compass (also known as a pair of compasses ) or with just a pencil and some string. I think we take the circle for granted because it\u2019s so familiar, but it\u2019s been the site of some important mathematical epiphanies for me, and of course it\u2019s been an important figure in math history. The sine of the angle \u03b1 is the ratio of the lengths of the opposite site (labeled in green) to the hypotenuse (labeled in red). Credit: Dnu72, Pengo, Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 3.0) \nThe unit circle in trigonometry was one of my early mathematical epiphanies. The name trigonometry refers to the study of triangles (which would be called trigons if we named them the way we name most polygons). The functions sine, cosine, tangent, exsecant , and so on all refer to ratios of side lengths of right triangles. If an angle \u03b1 is less than 90 degrees, you can find its sine by drawing a right triangle with one of the angles equal to \u03b1 and taking the ratio of the side length of the leg adjacent to alpha to the hypotenuse. If you have an angle that\u2019s greater than 90 degrees, you can still compute the sine of the angle, but you have to base it on a triangle where one angle is 180-\u03b1 rather than \u03b1. A unit circle as it is used in trigonometry. The sine of the angle t is the y-coordinate of the point where the hypotenuse meets the unit circle, and the cosine of t is the x-coordinate. Credit: Gustavb Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 3.0) \nUnderstanding all the relationships between different trig functions and different types of angles is vastly simplified by setting the hypotenuse of all the right triangles equal to 1 and placing them inside a circle. Now you don\u2019t have to worry about anything when you divide the side length by the length of the hypotenuse because the hypotenuse is 1 unit long. You can just read the sine off of the picture! After a few weeks of struggling to remember which trig function was which for which angle in a triangle, learning about and then internalizing the unit circle was huge for me. I could see the relationship between sine and cosine just by visualizing an angle moving along the circle. Understanding that idea made trigonometry feel like so much more than memorizing a list of rules. I\u2019m too afraid of commitment and discomfort to get a tattoo, but the unit circle would be pretty high on the list if I were considering one.

Credit: LucasVB Wikimedia \nThen there\u2019s the problem of measuring the length of the unit circle, or the ratio of any circle's circumference to its diameter, a little constant you just might have heard of called \u03c0. As Dave Richeson described in an episode of the My Favorite Theorem podcast , to figure out how long the outside of a circle is, we first have to figure out what we mean by the length of a curved, rather than straight, segment. Many ancient cultures knew good approximations for \u03c0, but study of that number itself\u2014getting better bounds on it, determining that it is neither rational or algebraic , and current investigations into whether it is a normal number \u2014has been a long and important journey in mathematics. \nBut you can read more about circles and \u03c0 on Pi Day , so we'll move along. I introduced the unit circle as the 1-dimensional sphere in this post, in part because it sounds fancy and official, and in part because understanding the dimension of a circle is another of those mathematical epiphany moments for me. \nIf we call the circle the 1-dimensional sphere, it stands to reason that we can define higher-dimensional spheres similarly. So if S 1 is set of points (x,y) that satisfy the equation x 2 +y 2 =1, then the 2-sphere S 2 is the set of points (x,y,z) in 3-dimensional space that satisfy the equation x 2 +y 2 +z 2 =1. (This is the shape we would be most comfortable calling a sphere.) The 3-sphere S 3 is the set of points (w,x,y,z) in 4-dimensional space that satisfy the equation w 2 +x 2 +y 2 +z 2 =1. You get the idea. The n-sphere, or n-dimensional sphere, is a set of points in (n+1)-dimensional space. Why this dimensional mismatch? \nIn short, because the 1-sphere is the sphere that is a 1-dimensional object. The 2-sphere is the sphere that is the 2-dimensional object. But it's not easy to think of them like that. If you asked people what dimension a circle is, I'll bet most of them would say 2-dimensional, and I think there are two reasons for that. \nFirst, we are terribly sloppy with the term circle. In the above definition, the circle is just the points that are exactly 1 unit away from (0,0), not all the points within 1 unit of (0,0). When I was a kid, I learned, and you probably did too, that the area of a circle is \u03c0r 2 where r is the circle\u2019s radius. That formula is actually for the area of the disk, all the points between the origin and the circle, all the points that satisfy x 2 +y 2 \u22641, and it's a 2-dimensional object. We sometimes use the word circle to mean both the border and the inside of this space, and then when we want to use the term for only one of those spaces, we generate confusion. \nBut even if we manage to keep the circle and the disk straight, it\u2019s not easy to think of the circle as 1-dimensional. I think truly understanding why the circle is a 1-dimensional space, not a 2-dimensional space, was an important conceptual breakthrough for me when I finally understood it. It\u2019s easy to see why the circle feels 2-dimensional. I described it as a subset of 2-dimensional space using two coordinates, x and y . But what if I had described it as the points in 3-dimensional space such that x 2 +y 2 =1 and z=0? That equation describes a circle that\u2019s exactly the same shape as the one we put in 2-dimensional space, but now it\u2019s a subset of 3-dimensional space. I think the big breakthrough for me was understanding that mathematically, we want dimension to reflect an intrinsic property of the shape, not a property of the space the shape lives in. \nMathematicians often describe dimension by invoking the idea of an ant living on a surface or thinking about zooming in on the surface. A shape is 1-dimensional if an ant living on it would think it looked like a line, or if a sufficiently zoomed-in version of it would look like a line segment. If looking like a line is too wishy-washy for you, maybe you\u2019d prefer thinking of the ways an ant confined to a circle could move. An ant living on a circle could walk forwards or backwards, but that\u2019s it. There\u2019s only one axis of directions in which the ant could travel. When we travel around on the surface of the earth (we can dig or jump a little, but we're more or less confined to a 2-sphere), we can travel in combinations of the north-south direction and the east-west direction, so we have two axes that describe the ways we can move. \nThe circle is probably the simplest example of a mathematical space whose dimension isn\u2019t completely obvious, so thinking through it and really internalizing its 1-dimensionality was for me a key to start thinking about dimension mathematically, from the point of view of the object itself, not the ambient space. Once you\u2019ve gotten that, you can see why the 2-sphere, the shape of the skin of a beach ball, is a fundamentally 2-dimensional space. Then you can start thinking about more complicated surfaces and all the different ways 2-dimensionality can arrange itself in the world. And what about us? We 3-dimensional creatures, mere specks in the grand scheme of things, feel like we live in an endless 3-dimensional space, but could it loop around on itself? What larger structures could our universe have? How could we tell? All of a sudden you\u2019re contemplating the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture , the most important mathematical breakthrough of the current century to date. And all that starting from a circle! Not bad for a symbol that literally represents the idea of nothingness in our number system. \nRead about more of my favorite spaces:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

dandelion siphonophore is one of the finest . What you are about to see is the tuft of feeding tentacles and anchor cables of an organism that looks like it would be at home perched atop a truffula tree. \nCredit: NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, 2017 American Samoa \nThis year the two ocean exploration ships Okeanos Explorer and Nautilus have uncovered a variety of interesting siphonophores, including this stunning dandelion, a type of siphonophore distinguished by its attachment to the seafloor. \nSiphonophores have similar gigs to their jellyfish and coral kin in the phylum Cnidaria : stinging and eating things. However, their appearance is quite different. Rather than a single naked medusa or a colony lodged inside a fortified skeleton, siphonophores are naked colonies of Siamese twins. They are not identical, though. They usually specialize in a particular task and contain only the anatomy necessary to perform that function. Some push the colony forward, some catch and eat food, and some make little siphonophores. \nOkeanos Explorer , which took the first video, sighted another dandelion siphonophore this summer that appears to have an adaptation I have not seen before: a system of retractable and reusable fishing lines suspended from the anchor cables. I have never seen anything like this before. As one of the commentators says, it\u2019s mesmerizing. \nOf course, part of what makes dandelion siphonophores so weird is that they are tethered to the seafloor and relatively small. Most siphonophores drift in long chains. \nThere were at least two sightings of drifting siphonophores this year too. Here\u2019s one from the Nautilus that looks like a bunch of dandelion siphonophores strung together like beads on a string -- or, as the watch points out, a feather boa: \nAnd here\u2019s another sort of drifting siphonophore from Okeanos Explorer that looks quite different to the last one. In this one, you can really see the division of labor.

This left-side bias holds true for both men and women and it also applies to the skin cancer melanoma. Researchers \u00d6rjan Hallberg of Hallberg Independent Research in Sweden and Ollie Johansson of The Karolinska Institute in Sweden, writing in the June issue of the journal Pathophysiology , suggest a surprising explanation that not only points to a common cause for both cancers, it may change your sleeping habits. \nFor unknown reasons the rates of breast cancer and melanoma have both increased steadily in the last 30 years. Exposure to the sun elevates the risk of melanoma, but the sun's intensity has not changed in the last three decades. Stranger still, melanoma most commonly affects the hip, thighs and trunk, which are areas of the body protected from the sun. What is responsible for the left-side dominance and increasing incidence of these cancers? \nAn intriguing clue comes from the Far East. In Japan there is no correlation between the rates of melanoma and breast cancer as there is in the West, and there is no left-side prevalence for either disease. Moreover, the rate of breast cancer in Japan is significantly lower than in the West; only 3 percent of what is seen in Sweden, for example. The rate of prostate cancer in Japan is only 10 percent of that in the U.K. and U.S. \nThe researchers suggest an explanation based on differences in sleeping habits in Japan and Western countries. Previous research has shown that both men and women prefer to sleep on their right sides. The reasons for this general preference are unclear, but sleeping on the right side may reduce the weight stress on the heart, and the heartbeat is not as loud as when sleeping on the left. Still, there is no reason to suspect that people in Japan sleep in positions that are any different from those in the West. The beds in Japan, however, are different. The futons used for sleeping in Japan are mattresses placed directly on the bedroom floor, in contrast to the elevated box springs and mattress of beds used in the West. A link between bedroom furniture and cancer seems absurd, but this, the researchers conclude, is the answer. \nThe first line of evidence they cite comes from a 2007 study in Sweden conducted between 1989 and 1993 that revealed a strong link between the incidence of melanoma and the number of FM and TV transmission towers covering the area where the individuals lived. Despite epidemiological correlations like this one suggesting the possibility that electromagnetic radiation from FM and TV broadcasts stations could suppress the immune system and promote cancer , the strength of these electromagnetic fields is so feeble it has been difficult to imagine any biological basis for the correlation. \nConsider, however, that even a TV set cannot respond to broadcast transmissions unless the weak electromagnetic waves are captured and amplified by an appropriately designed antenna. Antennas are simply metal objects of appropriate length sized to match the wavelength of a specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation. Just as saxophones are made in different sizes to resonate with and amplify particular wavelengths of sound, electromagnetic waves are selectively amplified by metal objects that are the same, half or one quarter of the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave of a specific frequency. Electromagnetic waves resonate on a half-wavelength antenna to create a standing wave with a peak at the middle of the antenna and a node at each end, just as when a string stretched between two points is plucked at the center. In the U.S. bed frames and box springs are made of metal, and the length of a bed is exactly half the wavelength of FM and TV transmissions that have been broadcasting since the late 1940s. In Japan most beds are not made of metal, and the TV broadcast system does not use the 87- to 108-megahertz frequency used in Western countries. \nThus, as we sleep on our coil-spring mattresses, we are in effect sleeping on an antenna that amplifies the intensity of the broadcast FM/TV radiation. Asleep on these antennas, our bodies are exposed to the amplified electromagnetic radiation for a third of our life spans. As we slumber on a metal coil-spring mattress, a wave of electromagnetic radiation envelops our bodies so that the maximum strength of the field develops 75 centimeters above the mattress in the middle of our bodies. When sleeping on the right side, the body's left side will thereby be exposed to field strength about twice as strong as what the right side absorbs. \nIf this study is correct, the solution is simple: Replace the metal in our beds with a nonmetallic mattress or orient your bed, like an antenna, away from the direction of the local FM/TV transmission tower. Call it high-tech feng shui if you like, but if this new study has not identified the cause of left-side cancer, it will, for some, be the cause of insomnia. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR \nR.

Credit: NASA MSFC Advertisement \nEarth's moon doesn't have much of an atmosphere today. However, it may have had a more prominent atmosphere 3 billion to 4 billion years ago, when volcanic eruptions spewed giant clouds of gas above the lunar surface, a new study has found. \nToday's moon is covered in dead volcanoes and dark maria, or plains that consist of hardened lava. The lunar atmosphere is so thin it's not even technically an atmosphere\u2014instead, it's considered an \"exosphere,\" with molecules that are gravitationally bound to the moon but are too sparse to behave like a gas. \nA new study from scientists at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston suggests that the moon's ancient volcanoes produced a temporary atmosphere that lingered for 70 million years before dissipating into space. [ How the Moon Evolved: A Photo Timeline ] \nSamples of volcanic glasses collected by Apollo astronauts in the 1970s revealed that magma beneath the lunar surface billions of years ago \"carried gas components, such as carbon monoxide, the ingredients for water, sulfur, and other volatile species,\" LPI officials said in a statement . \nIn the new study, the researchers calculated how much gas rose from the lavas that flowed from the lunar volcanoes. They determined that enough gases accumulated around the moon to form an atmosphere, and that this atmosphere grew faster than it could escape into space. \nLPI officials said that the findings may have big implications for future exploration of the moon , because it \"quantifies a source of volatiles that may have been trapped from the atmosphere into cold, permanently shadowed regions near the lunar poles and, thus, may provide a source of ice suitable for a sustained lunar exploration program.\" \nThe study was published online Sept. 25 in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters .

Over the course of the next ten months, I rereading my collection of ethnographies and popular science books and to share some thoughts with you. \nBrennan, Denise (2004). What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It? Transnational Desires and Sex Tourism in the Dominican Republic . Duke University Press. \nWe spend a lot of time in Love exploring the fluidity of landscapes. On the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, about 30 minutes from Puerto Plata, Sos\u00faa is thriving tourist destination. With many beaches and bars, it embodies the idea of what the Caribbean is: a warm, friendly, relaxed, exotic place. It also hosts a large sex tourism scene, and while global and national identities and responses loom in the background, we\u2019re immersed in shifting personal landscapes as well. \nLove documents Denise Brennan\u2019s fieldwork in the sexscape of Sos\u00faa. This small seaside community has become a destination for Afro-Dominican and Afro-Haitian women who are looking to sell sex as a means of attaining what they perceive will be a better life off of the island. To these ends, they deploy sex \u201cfor residencia not por amor.\u201d They approach their sexual liaisons strategically, understanding that if they play their part convincingly enough, it could help them and their dependents immensely. They occupy themselves with cultivating these relationships when their clients return to Europe. They maintain communications through faxes, sending love letters and promises transnationally. And in Love, the sex tourists who participate in this landscape and develop relationships with these women are also strategically building identities and realities. \nSexscapes link sex work to the global economy through three defining characteristics: international travel from the developed to the developing world, consumption of paid sex, and inequality. With the focus on a specific geographic location, the act of exchange in this space highlights the power differentials between buyers (sex tourists) and sellers (sex workers) and emphasizes the positioning of race, gender, class, and nationality. We see how people are changed through their interactions within this space and with the space itself. Inasmuch as this is a story of agency and illusion, Sos\u00faa itself is also a character that needs to be contended with. \nWhen Brennan introduces us to Elena, she had just been released from jail, having been picked up in a sweep that captured non-sex workers and sex workers alike who just happened to be on the street at the time. It was the middle of the day and none of the women were actively engaged in soliciting clients. Her friend Andrea, who was with her at the time, was not arrested even though she too was a sex worker because her boyfriend was on the police force. Sex work was the primary means by which Elena supported her two sisters and her young daughter, who all lived together in a one-room wooden house where they rotated between sharing a double bed and sleeping on the floor. Andrea notifies Elena\u2019s family and paid the needed bribe for Elena\u2019s release. That was lucky, but even more lucky is that Elena runs into Jurgen, a former client who had come to Sos\u00faa specifically to search for her. As testament to his affection, he had brought her gifts: perfume, as well as, a matching gold bracelet and necklace. After this fortuitous encounter, Elena returns home and her immediate female network of her sisters and young daughter help her prepare for an extended engagement with Jurgen. Elena gets her hair done and they help her choose her outfit for the night with the understanding that the gifts and money she would receive from Jurgen would trickle down to her family. \nJurgen is an older German man, and seems, at close reading, to typify sex tourists at the time. They are mostly older, white men. (When Brennan returns to Sos\u00faa toward the end of the book, she finds that this demographic has shifted significantly.) In the minds of the women of Sos\u00faa, they are more dependable and stable in comparison to Dominican men. This mythology is central to the persistence of sex work in Sos\u00faa. During Jurgen\u2019s stay, Elena moves in with him at the tourist resort and the image that unfolds very closely resembles that of a family: Jurgen takes Elena, her daughter and sisters out to eat, he wipes her daughter\u2019s nose, she offers his money to pay for Brennan\u2019s meal. These actions paint a very intimate picture of a budding relationship, so it is not surprising that Elena is distraught when Jurgen has to return to Germany. There is no controlling what will happen once Jurgen leaves. While he promises that he is committed to Elena, his departure means she\u2019ll have to move back to her one room home and resume sex work to meet her financial commitments\u2014like paying her parents\u2019 grocer bills, and providing food and shelter for her sisters and daughter. Jurgen keeps his word, however, and not only sends money but moves to Sos\u00faa, marries Elena and moves her and her family into a two bedroom apartment with running water and a electric generator. He buys furniture, a color television set, and pays for private school for her daughter. \nElena\u2019s story is one realization of the objectives held by sex workers in Sos\u00faa. She is able to get a European man to support her and her family. She does not leave the island, as many hope to do, but she is able to leave sex work and live a relatively middle-class lifestyle. \nHowever she quickly finds that this dream is not entirely as she imagined. And this is the untold side of the realization of the dream. There are cultural clashes between her and Jurgen about the management of money. He feels she asks him for money all the time, and she does because she is managing money as poor, Dominican women do in that they shop for what they need when they need it. This means they may go to the market several times a day. As the initial appeal of the erotic/exotic start to wane, Jurgen looks for these things with someone new. Elena knows this is happening but it more concerned that he is not upholding his duties as her \u201cesposo,\u201d in this case, a common law husband. He eventually leaves her and denies the paternity of the son they have together, saying the child is too black to be his. And when he does, she finds that as she has been entirely dependent on him for their time together, she has nothing\u2014the furniture is his, after all. \nWhile Elena meets another German man years later and does eventually move to Germany, this relationship also falls apart. So she builds a sense of stability for herself by obtaining a position where she manages a bar to support her children. The owner spends a lot of time in Santo Domingo, which leaves her in charge. \nThere are many variations on Elena\u2019s story in Love. What remains consistent in all of them are the dynamics of exchange. As with many discussions around agency in sex work, the women of Sos\u00faa are actively looking to use their bodies to their ends. It is not a survival strategy, but an advancement strategy. Elena\u2019s earnings are not reinvested in herself but in her family, specifically her children. (This becomes a severe point of critique later from Elena toward another woman: she does not save money to secure her child\u2019s future but spends money on clothing.) Brennan advances the narrative that sex work can be a choice to sell one\u2019s body. But these women are selling more than that. They are manufacturing and selling an experience where tourists can come to Sos\u00faa and pretend that they are wealthy and renown. While any number of goods and services might be out of reach for them in Europe, in Sos\u00faa very little is off limits. They also find familiarity on return trips within the smallness of the locale that is Sos\u00faa. Bartenders and natives know them. They are celebrity, and eventually they may come to be locals. Both sides draw on stereotypes to fuel the exchange of sex for money. The exoticness of brown skin is conflated with sexual prowess, and while foreigners may use this as a justification for buying sex overall, Sos\u00faa sex workers deploy it as means to further their trade. \nSex tourists who settle in Sos\u00faa and build lives with the women they once paid for sex are constructing a world for themselves in the image of what they believe the Caribbean is. This is evident in the reason that Jurgen initially gives for moving to Sos\u00faa: it is a retirement of sorts. He claims he does not need to work as much as he does in Germany to get by and it\u2019s a more pleasant and relaxed lifestyle. Long sunny days where he can spend much of that time in a bar rather than engaged in the more traditional work is appealing. In this imagined world of relaxation and with the perceived absence of traditional lifestyle obligations, women like Elena have a part to play in keeping the fabric of illusion intact. Similarly, the world they construct with the support of sisters and mothers, and sometimes husbands and boyfriends, may help propel their agency and control against a globalized expectation that they are commodities. \nThere are moments in this dynamic when the power differential can shift. We se this with Elena who leverages her relationship with Jurgen to lift her family above poverty, even temporarily. And later when she determines a means of supporting her family away from sex work. The sellers are claiming something for themselves in what they ask for payment. Despite marriages por residencia, love (and familial obligation) has a great deal to do with the decisions these women make. Mari, a friend of Elena who works with her in bar, is positioned at the intersection of these narratives. She leaves her German partner Claus, and he follows her back to Sos\u00faa. And while she maintains she does not love him, she cannot deny the benefits for her daughter. She holds a fair amount of power in this relationship\u2014she openly flirts with her patrons and is allegedly seeing another man. All of this, to some degree, happens because Clause permits it, but it interesting and significant that she feels that can do this at all. We do not get closure on her situation, but are left with the idea that love and needs can exact measured and strategic responses that may never be fully understood on the individual level. \nHave you read What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It ?

Accumulated in large part as the byproduct of routine tasks, it is the unsalted, flavorless residue deposited en masse as organizations churn away. Surprise! This heap of refuse is inherently predictive. Thus begins a gold rush to dig up insightful gems. \nDoes crime increase after a sporting event? Do online daters more consistently rated as attractive receive less interest? Do vegetarians miss fewer flights? Does your e-mail address reveal your intentions? \nYes, yes, yes, and yes! \nWe\u2019ve entered the golden age of predictive discoveries. A frenzy of number crunching churns out a bonanza of colorful, valuable, and sometimes surprising insights \nPredictive analytics' aim isn\u2019t limited to assessing human hunches by testing relationships that seem to make sense. It goes further, exploring a boundless playing field of possible truths beyond the realms of intuition. And so it drops onto your desk connections that seem to defy logic. As strange, mystifying, or unexpected as they may seem, these discoveries help predict. \nWelcome to the Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not! of data science\u2014the Freakonomics of big data. \nBelow are nine colorful discoveries, each pertaining to a single predictor variable\u2014from the likes of Walmart, Uber, Harvard, Shell, Microsoft, and Wikipedia. These examples are new in this year's Revised and Updated edition of my book, Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie, or Die , bringing the book's more extensive \"Bizarre Insights\" table up to 46 total. (For more information about the examples below, access the book's Notes PDF\u2014provided at no charge at www.PredictiveNotes.com \u2013- and search by organization name.) \n\nPop-Tarts before a hurricane . Prehurricane, Strawberry Pop- Tart sales increased about sevenfold. \nWalmart \n\nIn preparation before an act of nature, people stock up on comfort or nonperishable foods. \nHigher crime, more Uber rides. In San Francisco, the areas with the most prostitution, alcohol, theft, and burglary are most positively correlated with Uber trips. \nUber \n\u201cWe hypothesized that crime should be a proxy for nonresidential population. . . Uber riders are not causing more crime . Right, guys? \u201d \nTyping with proper capitalization indicates creditworthiness. Online loan applicants who complete the application form with the correct case are more dependable debtors. Those who complete the form with all lower-case letters are slightly less reliable payers; all capitals reveals even less reliability. \nA financial services startup company \n\nAdherence to grammatical rules reflects a general propensity to correctly comply. \nUsers of the Chrome and Firefox browsers make better employees. Among hourly employees engaged in front-line service and sales-based positions, those who use these two custom Web browsers perform better on employment assessment metrics and stay on longer. \nA human resources professional services firm, over employee data from Xerox and other firms \n\"The fact that you took the time to install [another browser] shows . . . that you are an informed consumer . . . that you care about your productively and made an active choice.\u201d \nMen who skip breakfast get more coronary heart disease. American men 45 to 82 who skip breakfast showed a 27 percent higher risk of coronary heart disease over a 16-year period. \nHarvard University medical researchers \n\nBesides direct health effects\u2014if any\u2014eating breakfast may be a proxy for lifestyle: People who skip breakfast may lead more stressful lives and \u201cwere more likely to be smokers, to work full time, to be unmarried, to be less physically active, and to drink more alcohol.\u201d \nMore engaged employees have fewer accidents. Among oil refinery workers, a one percentage-point increase in team employee engagement is associated with a 4 percent decrease in the number of safety incidents per employee. \nShell \nMore engaged workers are more attentive and focused. \n\nSmart people like curly fries. Liking \u201cCurly Fries\u201d on Facebook is predictive of high intelligence. \nResearchers at the University of Cambridge and Microsoft Research \nAn intelligent person was the first to like this Facebook page, \u201cand his friends saw it, and by homophily, we know that he probably had smart friends, and so it spread to them . . . ,\u201dand so on. \n\nFemale-named hurricanes are more deadly. Based on a study of the most damaging hurricanes in the United States during six recent decades, the ones with \u201crelatively feminine\u201d names killed an average of 42 people, almost three times the 15 killed by hurricanes with \u201crelatively male\u201d names. \nUniversity researchers \n\nThis may result from \u201ca hazardous form of implicit sexism.\u201d Psychological experiments in a related study \u201csuggested that this is because feminine- versus masculine-named hurricanes are perceived as less risky and thus motivate less preparedness. . . . Individuals systematically underestimate their vulnerability to hurricanes with more feminine names.\u201d \nHigher status, less polite. Editors on Wikipedia who exhibit politeness are more likely to be elected to \u201cadministrative\u201d status that grants greater operational authority. However, once elected, an editor\u2019s politeness decreases. \nResearchers examining Wikipedia behavior \n\u201cPoliteness theory predicts a negative correlation between politeness and the power of the requester.\u201d \n\nAnd now a word of warning! In the table of examples above, do not give much credence to the \u201cSuggested Explanation\u201d column\u2019s attempt to answer \u201cwhy\u201d for each insight. For each one, there are also other plausible explanations, and, in most cases, only intuition rather than scientific evidence behind the particular answer provided. The reasons behind each discovery in the left column are generally unknown. Every explanation put forth, each entry in the rightmost column, is pure conjecture with absolutely no hard facts to back it up. \nThe dilemma is, as it is often said, correlation does not imply causation . The discovery of a predictive relationship between A and B does not mean one causes the other, not even indirectly. No way, no how. My Quartz article on this topic explores it in detail . \nBut do not fret. When applying predictive analytics, even though we generally don\u2019t have firm knowledge about causation, we often don\u2019t necessarily care. For many projects, the value comes from prediction, with only an avocational interest in understanding the world and figuring out what makes it tick. The freak show of surprising discovers delivers predictive value even when it does little to explain itself. \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Credit: Hector Retamal Getty Images Advertisement \nPeople regularly approach Jane Goodall in airports, tears in their eyes, and tell her she\u2019s their idol. She travels 300 days a year, and at 83, she speaks dreamily about her home in England, the house she grew up in, where her sister still lives with her own family. Goodall will be there soon for a rare five-day vacation, sleeping in the same room with her childhood books\u2014 Dr. Dolittle and Tarzan were among her favorites\u2014and looking out the window at the trees she once climbed. \nIn the 1960s Goodall, perhaps the world\u2019s most famous primatologist, taught us that humans and chimpanzees weren\u2019t as different from each other as people then believed. Our closest relatives have individual personalities, eat meat, and even make and use their own tools. A 1965 documentary about that work, Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees, turned Goodall into a global celebrity, and she has been in the public eye ever since. She has used that attention to fund ongoing research in Gombe Stream National Park, in Tanzania, where she did her initial conservation work. But she has also gone beyond her role as a scientist to encourage children to become environmental and social advocates, to develop antipoverty programs in the areas around African nature preserves, and to promote environmental stewardship. \nGoodall is on the road again now to publicize a new documentary, entitled simply JANE, which highlights her early-career insights. The film debuts Monday at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, with Goodall in attendance. After that she\u2019ll get her rare break, and then it\u2019s off to Japan, Argentina and Mexico; a few days off and then on to Europe, Africa \u201cand so on and so on until just before Christmas,\u201d she tells Scientific American . \nAlthough immensely practical about the hard work it takes to keep up her social justice mission, Goodall retains the idealism that has propelled her for decades. \u201cEvery single individual makes a difference every single day,\u201d she says in her quiet but determined British accent. \u201cWe get to choose what sort of difference we\u2019re going to make.\u201d \nGoodall spoke to Scientific American about her past work, recent discoveries and plans and hopes for the future. \n[ An edited transcript of the interview follows. ] \nYou are sometimes criticized for caring too much about animals when there are people suffering. Why do you think it\u2019s important to conserve animals? Think what the world would be like without animals. It would collapse. Ecosystems must be healthy. By helping the animals, we\u2019re helping the people, too. Certainly in Africa, where we do most of our work, it\u2019s very, very clear that if you don\u2019t work to improve the lives of people living around chimp habitats, they\u2019ll give up saving the chimps. It just won\u2019t work. One of our biggest programs in Africa is working to improve the lives of people in 52 villages around Gombe National Park and spread out through the rest of the chimp habitat in Tanzania\u2014and we have similar programs in Uganda, DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo], the Republic of [the] Congo, Senegal and Burundi. \nWhat are your feelings about ecotourism? Some ecotourism is really important because it brings money into the central government [of those countries], it provides jobs for the local people and educates children better. The trouble is, it tends to be: \u201cSix people in a group brings in so much money. Okay, let\u2019s make it 12.\u201d Then, \u201cLet\u2019s make it 24.\u201d\u2014then you start damaging the very environment and animals that people are going to see. It needs to be carefully monitored and greed mustn\u2019t get in the way of long-term sustainability. \nAre you concerned about the direction we\u2019re going in terms of climate change? How do you think human behavior can be changed to address it? We\u2019re heading toward total disaster and I don\u2019t know how long we have to try and do something about it. What we have to do, which is of great importance, is to stop pandering to the fossil fuel industry and get onto clean, green energy. America could be basically off the grid by now. We\u2019ve got sun, we\u2019ve got wind, we\u2019ve got currents, but we\u2019re adding to the greenhouse gases, recklessly burning fossil fuels, burning forests and [fueling] our desire to eat more and more meat\u2014which is raising millions of animals in these terrible factory farms where they\u2019re treated as though they\u2019re mere things\u2014In fact they\u2019re sentient beings and it\u2019s shocking. \nIn the United States a number of scientists have become politically active in response to current events. Others think scientists should stay outside of politics. Where do you come down? I think scientists owe it to future generations to come out of their ivory towers. That\u2019s one thing the Trump administration here has certainly done\u2014it has woken people up and has brought many scientists out\u2026to speak up about what\u2019s going on. \nDo you still consider yourself a scientist? In a way, I\u2019ve abandoned the science, but in a way I haven\u2019t. We have a wonderful research team in Gombe carrying on with the science. That\u2019s my legacy there. \nWe\u2019re using cutting-edge scientific technology in our conservation efforts\u2014 mapping the chimpanzee range\u2014but I think most importantly, teaching local people, volunteers, how to use smartphones and tablets. They have chosen what they will record about the health of their forests. They go in and record illegally cut trees, an animal trap, a chimpanzee nest or a leopard paw print, so village leaders can make responsible decisions. That\u2019s such an important tool of conservation: to become partners with the local people. \nWhat do you think animals offer us in our daily lives? They have begun having dogs in airports to calm people when they arrive and have lost their luggage and have screaming children. It has proved that having a dog to pet can reduce that stress. In San Francisco and one of the New York airports they have therapy pigs\u2014I love it! I met Lulu [the pig] in San Francisco. She\u2019s charming! She goes around on a little leash, with a little therapy animal jacket. You watch as people pass by, everybody smiles. Literally, it changes the atmosphere\u2014boom. I just love watching how it changes people. \nTraveling so much, can you have a pet of your own? I can\u2019t, can I? One of the things I miss more than anything else in my life is having a dog. That may be my one consolation when I\u2019m no longer fit enough to travel around the world. Maybe I can get a dog again. \nIt sounds like all of your travels are getting tiresome. Are you ready to retire? I was given many gifts, but two in particular: one is a very healthy constitution. I can still do this at age 83; two [is] the gift of communication. People are listening. If you happen to have grandchildren, if you happen to love animals, if you happen to realize the spiritual necessity of our relationship with the natural world, if you happen to realize how we depend for the future on the ecosystems of the planet for clean water and air to breathe\u2014and you have a gift to make people understand and perhaps make small changes in the way they live, then you have to use them\u2026. Well, I feel that. I sometimes feel that if there is a Creator, which I believe, some kind of great spiritual force, I\u2019m being pushed.

As he drives around his property in Australia\u2019s Bega Valley, halfway between Melbourne and Sydney, he\u2019s continually planning how and when he\u2019ll move his Angus cows and Merino ewes around so that he can beat the spread of the densely tufted weed. \nMawhinney\u2019s property covers 600 hectares (1,500 acres) of gently undulating country, 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of a line of blue hills that mark the edge of the Great Dividing Range. About a third is severely infested with the invasive non-native weed, with thick, meter-high tussocks waving fluffy gray heads over most of the paddock. Mawhinney also has smaller infestations over another third of his property. \nLovegrass , once thought to have value as a pasture crop, is hardy and competitive, produces vast quantities of seed that cattle spread via their hair and dung, and it\u2019s well suited to the climate of the valley, in the rain shadow of the Snowy Mountains. But cattle won\u2019t eat it until they\u2019ve chewed every other pasture species to the ground. \n\u201cThey eat everything else first, so lovegrass gets a distinct advantage,\u201d Mawhinney says. If a farmer\u2019s not careful, it can quickly take over a paddock, making the land all but useless: Cattle can\u2019t survive when they have nothing but lovegrass to eat. Unless it\u2019s fertilized, burned and watered, lovegrass has little nutritional value. \nThe problems with African lovegrass extend beyond its failure as forage. Tussocks can become so big that cattle can\u2019t get between them to search for more palatable grasses. Herding takes longer. Sheep get lost in it. Farmers damage their vehicles going down wombat burrows they can\u2019t see because the lovegrass is so tall. \n\u201cIf left alone, it\u2019s only a few years and it can actually wipe you out. You end up with no farm at the end,\u201d Mawhinney says. \nLovegrass could also wipe out what little is left of the Bega Valley\u2019s endangered lowland grassy woodlands. With their scattering of eucalyptus trees growing over native pastures composed of tussock grasses, short grasses and herbs, grassy woodlands have been valued historically as a low-cost, drought-resistant source of forage and shelter for cattle and sheep. As agriculture has intensified in the valley, clearing, sowing of non-native pasture species, fertilizer use and intensive grazing have greatly reduced the extent of these native pastures. African lovegrass is rapidly invading what remains. Losing native pastures to lovegrass hurts not only the livelihood of farmers, but the conservation of an endangered ecosystem. \nSomething needed to be done to help farmers gain control over lovegrass. What started as casual conversation among a local plant ecologist, an agricultural officer and a farmers\u2019 representative snowballed into a collaboration between a team of scientists and an engaged community of farmers that not only led to better lovegrass control, but demonstrated a new way to approach research on invasive species. Massive Problem \nThe Bega Valley is famous for its dairy industry\u2014the words \u201cBega\u201d and \u201ccheese\u201d are inextricably linked in the minds of most Australians\u2014but land in the region is mainly used to graze meat cattle and sheep. \nFive years ago, the Far South Coast Landcare Association set up the Bega Valley Farmers\u2019 Network to help the increasing number of dryland farmers in the valley improve the productivity and environmental health of their farms. When the network coordinator Wayne Schaefer first approached farmers to discuss their concerns, African lovegrass emerged as the most important. \nSome landholders were managing to keep lovegrass out of their paddocks, while others weren\u2019t. Farmers were divided about how best to control it. Some believed you could manage infestations of lovegrass and still be productive and profitable. Others believed that once lovegrass began to take over a native pasture there was little choice but to convert it to a kikuyu-based pasture that resists lovegrass invasion. Unlike the native tussock grasses, kikuyu, another species introduced from Africa, can compete with lovegrass for soil water and nutrients when it\u2019s grazed \nDespite the abundance of farmers\u2019 opinions on lovegrass, there was little evidence that might guide them on the best thing to do. \u201cIt seemed like such a massive problem, and no one was working on it,\u201d says ecologist and Bega Valley resident Josh Dorrough , now principal scientist with the Office of Environment and Heritage New South Wales. It was a thought Dorrough (then working as an ecological research consultant) shared with Schaefer and Local Land Services officer Andrew Taylor. Together they gained a small amount of funding to start to bring some science to bear on the issue. \u201cLandholder-First\u201d Approach \nDorrough began working with farmers\u2019 groups on a research project to better understand how lovegrass affected farmers in the valley, and whether and how they were controlling it. He invited ecologist Jennifer Firn, an associate professor at Queensland University of Technology, to help out. Firn had tested control methods for African lovegrass in southern Queensland and, like Dorrough, saw the value of tapping into the knowledge that farmers had gained from observing lovegrass on their farms over many years, through good seasons and in drought. \nDorrough, Firn and research assistant Emma Ladouceur began studying lovegrass in the Bega Valley using what they call a \u201clandholder-first\u201d approach . Dorrough interviewed 15 landholders in the valley about which parts of their farm were being invaded by lovegrass and how they were controlling it. The researchers then tested the landholders\u2019 ideas for controlling the weed in field trials on the same 15 properties. This strategy not only tapped the farmers\u2019 knowledge but also was specifically designed to yield information the farmers would find useful. \nSome farmers thought that slashing lovegrass and then putting a large number of cattle per hectare into the paddock was an effective and profitable strategy. But the researchers showed that slashing did not reduce the density of lovegrass. Not only that, but when Dorrough and agricultural economics consultant Jim Crosthwaite analyzed the costs of this approach, they found it was costing farmers more to slash lovegrass than could be earned from grazing cattle in that paddock. \nSimilarly, many farmers thought an alternative control technique, \u201croller-wiping\u201d with herbicide, was a waste of time. To roller-wipe a paddock, farmers let their cattle eat down palatable pasture species to less than 15 centimeters (6 inches) in height, then tow a carpeted drum roller covered in herbicide over the taller, uneaten lovegrass. The research showed that roller-wiping was a successful way to reduce even heavy infestations of lovegrass, that it could be cost-effective and that native pastures were likely to recover because the seeds of many native species remained, waiting to germinate, in the soil beneath. Seriously Practical \nThe \u201cseriously practical\u201d approach of the researchers impressed Mawhinney, who was one of the farmers involved in the project. He\u2019s now using a roller-wiper on his lighter infestations of lovegrass, and he\u2019s steadily beating it. Word of Mawhinney\u2019s success has spread in the valley: Farmers he doesn\u2019t even know stop him in the street to ask him how he manages his lovegrass, and 60 people attended a recent information session held on his farm. \nSuch opportunities to share stories of success are important but, Mawhinney says, farmers won\u2019t go to information days where they suspect there\u2019ll be a \u201ctotal disconnect\u201d between the research that\u2019s being presented and the way farmers actually manage their properties. \nThe landholder-first approach that Dorrough, Firn and colleagues used for lovegrass reflects an evolving recognition by scientists of the value of engaging with local experts to help understand and solve conservation problems. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a massive opportunity that gets overlooked, to do science as a social outreach process,\u201d says Andrew Knight, a conservation scientist at Imperial College London. Conservation relies on the values and actions of people, he says. Science plays a key role in solving problems but, Knight argues, the idea that science can do so alone is mistaken. Scientists are rarely the ones implementing their own recommendations, so building relationships with the people that actually manage the land is as important as collecting the ecological data. \nAcknowledging that people on the ground matter to the landscape is a shift in thinking that is slowly happening in ecological science, Firn says. The perceptions of those who live on the land \u201cmatter more in that community than any scientific paper we can publish, so if we can test the existing ideas\u2014evidence they\u2019re potentially right or evidence they\u2019re potentially not right\u2014then we\u2019re more apt to influence management than just another pamphlet coming to your door.\u201d ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wayne schaefer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lovegrass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viki cramer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer firn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew knight", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorrough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh dorrough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma ladouceur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knight", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mawhinney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vivan mawhinney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim crosthwaite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "firn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schaefer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "queensland university of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "local land services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "far south coast landcare association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imperial college london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of environment and heritage new south wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bega valley farmers\u2019 network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ensia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snowy mountains", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bega valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "queensland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T15:11:35.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4816b8ebcdac8beda02a92b623cdf573181e364b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnGYZMVoc3fK6bHGNJm3GbKAqXyFeOZvOgTn1oofUEzTtb6klNcU3RQSiX14On8AGFeyCGM4kyr03dMS6sWTIddM-", "site_full": "www.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Giant Neuron Found Wrapped around an Entire Mouse Brain - Scientific American", "title_full": "Giant Neuron Found Wrapped around an Entire Mouse Brain - Scientific American", "published": "2017-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.043, "main_image": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/BBEB0A71-6B79-48C6-B1B63E4BBADC9CC8_agenda.jpg?w=600&amp;h=335", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4666, "comments": 0, "shares": 4666}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 6}, "linkedin": {"shares": 71}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4816b8ebcdac8beda02a92b623cdf573181e364b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaJTrJDdptOLNRc8QRXwjOoeCn6VZmz5vCzBIoSJJrnGYZMVoc3fK6bHGNJm3GbKAqXyFeOZvOgTn1oofUEzTtb6klNcU3RQSiX14On8AGFeyCGM4kyr03dMS6sWTIddM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sara Reardon Nature", "published": "2017-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Giant Neuron Found Wrapped around an Entire Mouse Brain - Scientific American", "text": "Giant Neuron Found Wrapped around an Entire Mouse Brain 3-D reconstructions show a \"crown of thorns\" shape stemming from a region linked to consciousness By Sara Reardon , Nature on February 27, 2017 Share on Facebook Credit: Getty Images Advertisement \nLike ivy plants that send runners out searching for something to cling to, the brain\u2019s neurons send out shoots that connect with other neurons throughout the organ. A new digital reconstruction method shows three neurons that branch extensively throughout the brain, including one that wraps around its entire outer layer. The finding may help to explain how the brain creates consciousness. \nChristof Koch, president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington, explained his group\u2019s new technique at a February 15 meeting of the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative in Bethesda, Maryland. He showed how the team traced three neurons from a small, thin sheet of cells called the claustrum \u2014 an area that Koch believes acts as the seat of consciousness in mice and humans 1 . \nTracing all the branches of a neuron using conventional methods is a massive task. Researchers inject individual cells with a dye, slice the brain into thin sections and then trace the dyed neuron\u2019s path by hand. Very few have been able to trace a neuron through the entire organ. This new method is less invasive and scalable, saving time and effort. \nKoch and his colleagues engineered a line of mice so that a certain drug activated specific genes in claustrum neurons. When the researchers fed the mice a small amount of the drug, only a handful of neurons received enough of it to switch on these genes. That resulted in production of a green fluorescent protein that spread throughout the entire neuron. The team then took 10,000 cross-sectional images of the mouse brain and used a computer program to create a 3D reconstruction of just three glowing cells. Well connected \nThe three neurons stretched across both brain hemispheres, and one of the three wrapped around the organ\u2019s circumference like a \u201ccrown of thorns\u201d, Koch says. He has never seen neurons extend so far across brain regions. The mouse body contains other long neurons, such as a nerve projection in the leg and neurons from the brainstem that thread through the brain to release signalling molecules. But these claustrum neurons seem to connect to most or all of the outer parts of the brain that take in sensory information and drive behaviour. \nKoch sees this as evidence that the claustrum could be coordinating inputs and outputs across the brain to create consciousness. Brain scans have shown that the human claustrum is one of the most densely connected areas of the brain 2 , but those images do not show the path of individual neurons. \nThe claustrum is a good brain region in which to test the new technique because it has been extensively studied in mice and consists of only a few cell types, says James Eberwine, a pharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Taking stock \n\u201cIt\u2019s quite admirable,\u201d Rafael Yuste, a neurobiologist at Columbia University in New York City, says of the method. He doesn\u2019t think that the existence of neurons encircling the brain definitively proves that the claustrum is involved in consciousness. But he says that the technique will be helpful for census efforts that identify different cell types in the brain, which many think will be crucial for understanding how the organ functions. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to decipher language if we don't understand what the alphabet is,\u201d he says. \nYuste and Eberwine would like to see 3D reconstructions of individual neurons compared to analyses of the genes expressed in those neurons. This may offer clues as to the type and function of each cell. \nKoch plans to continue mapping neurons emanating from the claustrum, although the technique is too expensive to be used to reconstruct all of these neurons on a large scale. He would like to know whether all the region\u2019s neurons extend throughout the brain, or whether each neuron is unique, projecting to a slightly different area. \nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on February 24, 2017.

On this hot day in July, he went to his day program for adults with developmental disabilities, as he has done without incident five days a week for the past four years. But then things unraveled. According to the program\u2019s report, he grabbed a staff member\u2019s arm hard enough to bruise it. Then, on the bus during the daily outing, he started screaming and hitting his seat. Now, several hours later, he is finally home, but there is a stranger in his living room. Bouncing from one couch to another, clutching a faded beige blanket stolen from his aunt\u2019s dog, Kapothanasis still seems out of sorts. \nHis mother, Irene \u2014 who has cared for him, with the help of home aides, for all of his 24 years \u2014 is playing over the day\u2019s events, trying to figure out what triggered him. His outburst is disturbingly reminiscent of a difficult period that peaked six years ago but is uncharacteristic of the young man today. Kapothanasis loves interacting with other people, going to the beach and dining at DiMillo\u2019s, a floating restaurant in a decommissioned car ferry in Portland, Maine. \nKapothanasis has autism and speaks only a few words: He can\u2019t explain what happened this morning. Did he have constipation and discomfort, as his doctor suggested? Did he get bored of the day\u2019s program, causing him to act out? Had something occurred on the bus previously that made him fear that part of his day? All his mother can do is wonder \u2014 and try to make his evening better. \nKapothanasis places several pieces of gum in his mouth, something his mother says soothes him. Then he curls up for a nap and dozes off. The time it takes him to calm down is short compared with the protracted meltdowns that routinely overtook him during his teen years. He became aggressive starting in puberty: He would bite and hit himself, or hit and grab other students, teachers and bus drivers. His mother had to supervise his interactions with his siblings, even though, as triplets, they had always been close. In December 2011, when he was 18 years old and over 6 feet tall, his behaviors had escalated so much that his school enrolled him at the inpatient clinic at Spring Harbor Hospital in Maine. \n\u201cLook, we all have scars from Gregory, we\u2019ve all felt his wrath. And it came to the point where he had to be institutionalized,\u201d his mother says. He spent five long weeks at the hospital. \u201cIt was probably one of the darkest moments in our lives,\u201d she says. \nWhen Kapothanasis arrived at the hospital, he didn\u2019t seem sad, cried only on occasion and didn\u2019t respond to things not visible to others \u2014 signs he did not have depression or psychosis. But he startled easily, paced and rocked in place, and sweated heavily. \u201cThe phrase \u2018cat on a hot tin roof\u2019 was pretty descriptive,\u201d recalls Matthew Siegel , director of the developmental disorders program at the hospital. \nAfter several weeks of close observation, Siegel and his colleagues managed to piece together Kapothanasis\u2019 behaviors into a clear diagnosis, based on criteria outlined in the \u201cDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\u201d In addition to his autism, \u201che was kind of screaming anxiety \u2014 if you\u2019re looking for it,\u201d Siegel says. Until then, it seems no one had been. When Kapothanasis entered the clinic, he was on his third antipsychotic medication. Some are approved to treat aggression as a feature of autism, but none treat anxiety. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that he was not being treated for anxiety,\u201d Siegel says. \nThere are many reasons it took nearly six years for Kapothanasis to get the help he needed. Doctors may have assumed that his aggression and tendency to hurt himself were part of his autism, Siegel says. Traits that characterize autism \u2014 including social deficits, stereotyped movements and restricted interests \u2014 can mask or mimic symptoms of anxiety. During a visit to an outpatient clinic, for example, Siegel points out a nonverbal young woman with autism who repeatedly traces a pattern in the air with her hands. At first glance, her gestures resemble \u2018stimming,\u2019 the repetitive behaviors often seen in autism. But she does it at specific times, Siegel says, suggesting a ritual related to obsessive-compulsive disorder \u2014 a form of anxiety. \nCompounding the problem, many people on the spectrum, like Kapothanasis, cannot tell their caregivers or doctors what they are feeling or thinking. Those who can may still struggle to identify and understand their own emotions \u2014 a phenomenon called alexithymia \u2014 or to articulate them to others. Because of these factors, the clinical questionnaires designed to ferret out anxiety traits in neurotypical individuals are woefully inadequate for many people with autism. The tests may also miss children with autism, who can have unusual phobias, such as a fear of striped couches or exposed pipes. \n\u201cPeople on the spectrum have really unique, distinct ways of perceiving the world, and also have distinct experiences, which is why we\u2019ll see classic things like social phobia and generalized anxiety, but also maybe these more distinct, more autism-related manifestations,\u201d says psychologist Connor Kerns , assistant research professor at the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute in Philadelphia. Kerns and others are working on new ways to measure both ordinary and unusual forms of anxiety in people with autism. This work could help clinicians better detect the anxiety that hides behind autism, reveal the underlying mechanisms and lead to better treatment. Hiding in plain sight : \nAnxiety may seem to be a prominent feature of autism, but it is not one of the diagnostic criteria. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just part of autism, everyone with autism has anxiety.\u2019 That is 100 percent not true,\u201d Siegel says. \u201cI\u2019ve got 12 kids sitting outside my door at my hospital right now, and several of them do not have anxiety.\u201d \nStudies attempting to pin down the proportion of people with autism who also have clinically significant anxiety have produced a staggeringly broad range, from 11 to 84 percent . The discrepancy in these reported rates is \u201cfundamentally unbelievable,\u201d says Lawrence Scahill , professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta. \u201cWhenever you see a range like that, you know that it\u2019s driven by the source of the sample, where they got the sample from, the methods used to do the assessment and how quick they were to pull the trigger on a diagnosis.\u201d \nWhat is believable, he says, is that autism and anxiety are not independent conditions that sometimes co-occur. In fact, children with autism may be inherently more likely to develop anxiety than their typical peers. But the overlap in features between the two conditions makes diagnosing anxiety extremely difficult. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that the measurement of anxiety in children with autism has to be different,\u201d Scahill says. \nThe traditional tests for anxiety, such as the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders and the Spence Children\u2019s Anxiety Scale, rarely hold up as well in children with autism as they do in the groups they were designed for. In a 2013 study, Scahill and his colleagues investigated one particular test \u2014 the 20-item anxiety scale of the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI) \u2014 in parents of 415 children with autism. \nHow the researchers framed the test\u2019s questions significantly affected how the parents responded . Less than 5 percent of the parents endorsed statements describing anxiety that require a child to express herself \u2014 for instance, \u201cworries about physical health\u201d or \u201ccomplains about feeling sick when separation is expected.\u201d By contrast, parents were most likely to agree with statements that rely on their observations, such as \u201cacts restless or edgy.\u201d This trend was especially true among parents whose children have intellectual disability. \nBased on their findings, Scahill and his colleagues decided to talk to parents as part of their efforts to develop a measure of anxiety specific to children with autism. Over the course of six focus groups, which yielded more than 600 pages of transcripts, the researchers interviewed the parents of 45 children who have both autism and anxiety. They encouraged the parents to describe their child\u2019s behaviors rather than make inferences about what the child was thinking. They then used these observations to formulate 52 questions. The trick to deciding which questions to ask, Scahill says, was not letting features of autism \u201cleak\u201d into them. Many parents talked about meltdowns but, when pressed for more detail, agreed they couldn\u2019t tell the difference between meltdowns caused by anxiety and those that crop up for other reasons related to autism. Using meltdowns to flag anxiety in children with autism would have been a mistake, Scahill says. Instead, the focus group responses pointed to new indicators, including \u201cGets stuck on what might go wrong\u201d and \u201cNeeds a lot of reassurance that things will work out.\u201d \nIn unpublished data, the researchers combined the 52 new questions with the 20 questions on the CASI and gave them to 990 parents of children with autism. Based on the responses, they weeded out 31 items that were either redundant, seemingly irrelevant or rarely endorsed by the parents. Based on the remaining 41 queries, they found that roughly one-quarter of the children in the study have high levels of anxiety, another quarter have low levels of anxiety, and the rest fall somewhere in between. \nThe researchers plan to test whether the measure is reliable over time, evaluating the same children with 10-day breaks between sessions. If the screen proves reliable, Scahill says, it might also be used to assess the efficacy of anxiety treatments in children with autism. \u201cWe have more to offer the treatment of anxiety right now than we have for the core features of autism,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it behooves us, in my opinion, to be tough-minded about making sure we\u2019re measuring anxiety and not something else.\u201d Into the unknown : \nErik Chaston, a 29-year-old graduate of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, works at a credit union, developing detailed workflows for the bank\u2019s employees. Chaston, who has autism, has won awards for his clear and surprisingly entertaining videos that elucidate the supply-chain process. But for years, he was also fixated on the faint clicking noises people make with their saliva when they talk. \nAs a student, while working as a sound engineer for the campus sports channel, Chaston began obsessing over fixing these and other sounds in his recordings. \u201cIt made me feel like I was constantly worried about things, because everyone talks like this,\u201d he says. He held it together and excelled at work, but would shut down around his family. After he graduated, the problem seeded fears about what kind of job he would be able to hold down. The uncertainty made him especially anxious, he recalls. \nThis intolerance of uncertainty is a common refrain among people with autism and their parents. For many people on the spectrum, this feeling may simply be an expression of one of autism\u2019s core features \u2014 for instance, it may relate to inflexibility in the need to have enough time for a special interest or a fixation. But if that fixation turns into a source of constant fear or worry, it may in fact be an expression of anxiety, researchers say. \u201cTo me, it makes a lot of sense that it\u2019s something about the sticky element of the brains of people on the spectrum that would also lead them to have anxiety about change,\u201d Kerns says. \nIn 2014, Kerns and her colleagues developed an adapted version of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS) \u2014 a one- to two-hour clinical interview with both parents and children, designed to flag anxiety. Based on interviews with 59 children who have autism and their parents, the researchers documented examples of anxiety that don\u2019t fit the standard definition . Although nearly half of the children had traditional forms of anxiety, 18 of them also showed signs of non-traditional anxiety; another 9 children showed only the unusual forms of anxiety, such as an intolerance of uncertainty. \nSo Kerns and her colleagues expanded their \u2018ASD-specific addendum\u2019 to flag non-traditional anxiety traits that the standard screen might miss: fear of novelty or uncertainty; fear of social situations for reasons other than social ridicule; excessive worry about being able to engage in a special interest; and unusual phobias. The section on fearing change asks, for example, \u201cDoes your child react if the change is positive (e.g., getting out of school early)?\u201d The addendum also includes questions about a child\u2019s social skills, sensory sensitivities and repetitive behaviors to help clinicians differentiate anxiety from autism features. For instance, it asks about a child\u2019s history with bullying or social rejection to clarify whether a child is avoiding social events for a good reason \u2014 because her bully might attend \u2014 or because she is so traumatized by bullying that she fears any social outing. Only the latter would qualify as anxiety. \u201cWe want to look for when anxiety has overgrown the actual threat,\u201d Kerns says. Her work solidifies what many clinicians knew anecdotally. \u201c[Kerns] put a description to something that we had been seeing but didn\u2019t have a word for,\u201d Siegel says. \nWhy a fear of the unknown is a strong feature of autism is less clear. Some researchers speculate that people with autism have trouble predicting future events , heightening their sense of uncertainty. Other work implicates sensory sensitivities and poor verbal comprehension , suggesting that different aspects of autism feed into this type of anxiety. \nScientists are also looking for less subjective ways to measure anxiety in autism using various physiological and brain-imaging methods. John Herrington at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and his colleagues are in the midst of a long-term study of 150 children, roughly half of whom have autism, looking at measures of stress, such as heart rate variability and sweat levels. They are also using a technology that tracks where someone is looking to try to distinguish a lack of social interest from social anxiety. Initial findings from their brain-imaging data suggest that the amygdala, a brain region involved in making fearful associations, is smaller in children with autism and anxiety than in those with autism alone. \nAnother team is also homing in on the amygdala. Mikle South \u2019s team at Brigham Young University is exploring the theory that instead of having an overactive fear response, people with autism have trouble finding a \u2018safe space\u2019 and, as a result, are afraid of everything. To test that idea, he is interviewing some adults with autism about their specific fears and scanning others\u2019 brains. More than half of the people he talks to are consumed with worry , he says. \u201cThey worry about so much all of the time, they worry about everything,\u201d South says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing they\u2019re not worrying about.\u201d Confronting fears: \nBreaking the cycle of fear is never easy, but it may be especially difficult for someone with autism. For Chaston, help came from what he considered an unexpected source \u2014 a self-help book on mindfulness that his mother foisted on him. Practicing mindfulness helped him develop strategies to deal with things that annoyed him. The best-documented approach for treating anxiety in children with autism, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), works on similar principles. CBT combines talk therapy with repeated exposures to the source of the fear to change unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors. \nThat said, many children with autism may not benefit from traditional forms of CBT, says Eric Storch , professor of psychology at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Storch\u2019s team has found that children with autism who benefit from CBT do not always maintain those gains : Those who improve only a little sometimes do much better one to two years later, whereas some of those who respond well later relapse. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t sticking the way we would predict,\u201d Storch says. The findings suggest that children with autism need therapy for longer, and with more follow-up, than their typical peers \u2014\u201ca critical difference in the treatment approach,\u201d he says. \nChildren with autism also have trouble generalizing lessons learned in therapy to other aspects of their lives. That means it is especially important to include their caregivers in treatment, because these adults can reinforce the lessons throughout the child\u2019s day, Storch says. \nTo incorporate some of this extra support, a team at the University of California, Los Angeles developed a modified version of CBT, called the Behavioral Interventions for Children with Autism. The revision recommends, for example, that doctors and parents help a child to master appropriate social behaviors before putting the child in a feared social situation. Confronting situations that make the child anxious is crucial to the therapy\u2019s success, Storch says. The modification also offers extra help for children who may feel socially isolated, having therapists work with schools to give these children peers who can guide them through social situations. \nA small 2009 trial suggested that anxiety levels in most children with autism abate after they receive this modified version of CBT. A follow-up analysis found that another version of CBT adjusted for adolescents with autism is just as effective. A team of researchers, including Storch and Kerns, plans to compare the modified version with other therapies in children with autism in a 16-week trial of 180 children. Children who have autism and clinically diagnosed anxiety will receive either the modified or the traditional form of CBT, or will continue with whatever treatment they received before. \nTheir parents will also take the ADIS, along with Kerns\u2019 addendum. It is possible that the children who have non-traditional anxiety will benefit the most from a modified treatment, Kerns says. \nHowever successful, CBT cannot be the only option for children with autism, notes Roma Vasa , a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of variability in how much they can really report on their internal experience and how connected they are with their thoughts and their feelings,\u201d she says. \u201cThere needs to be more trials of effective medication to help these kids.\u201d \nThere are no drugs approved for treating anxiety in autism. Last year, Vasa and her colleagues published a set of recommendations for clinicians who prescribe anxiety drugs to children on the spectrum. Among her guidelines: Raise doses slowly, as these drugs may exacerbate irritability. \nIn Kapothanasis\u2019 case, drugs to treat his anxiety, including fluoxetine and guanfacine, turned out to be extremely helpful. Still, Siegel\u2019s team didn\u2019t rely on medications alone to treat him. They discovered that Kapothanasis had no real means of communicating. His aides at school had told his mother that he could, for example, ask for a bottle of water by handing over a drawing of it. But the speech-language pathologists in the hospital realized he really had no idea how to use this picture-exchange system. They helped him learn a new system, in which he points to photos of things from his daily life rather than to cartoon depictions of them. They prepared a visual schedule that lets him know what to expect each day. And, perhaps most valuable, according to his mother, is that they found new ways for him to soothe himself: by bouncing on a yoga ball or running his hands through tubs of uncooked rice. \nThese tactics are ones that now, years later, can still turn a bad day around. When Kapothanasis wakes from his catnap, he ambles over to the kitchen and makes himself a snack. Back in the living room, he spots a blue fleece blanket his mother has laid out for him in front of the television, a plastic bowl filled with uncooked rice in the center. \nAs he walks over to the rice, the tension in the air thins palpably. Contorting his large body into a pretzel shape and leaning close to the blanket, Kapothanasis dumps out the container\u2019s contents. Then, carefully placing the bowl in front of him, he scoops up handfuls of rice and lets them fall through his fingers in soft streams down his forehead. The grains tap out a staccato beat as they land in the bowl. Once it is full, he empties the bowl and begins again. And again \u2026 and again. After a while, he looks up, faces the stranger in the room for the first time. And smiles. \nThis story was originally published on Spectrum .

By Darren Naish on October 3, 2017 Credit: Gustav M\u00fctzel Wikimedia Advertisement \nThis week \u2013 October 2nd to 8th, 2017 \u2013 is Rodent Week , an unofficial online event kick-started by UK palaeontologist, SciComm wonder-woman and small mammal fan Elsa Panciroli (hat-tip also to Order Rodentia ). I\u2019ve been doing my bit to tweet some rodent love, and today I\u2019m going to blog on rodents too. I\u2019ll do more this week\u2026 if I can. The jerboa Jaculus showing its different locomotor strategies: (A) quadrupedal walking, (B) bipedal walking, (C) fast bipedal leaping. These drawings are from Hanney (1975) , probably my favourite book on rodents and one that you should definitely track down and obtain if you can. Credit: Hanney 1975 \nHere I\u2019m going to talk briefly about one of my favourite rodent groups: the jerboas. Part of the text here is recycled from material that appeared at Tet Zoo vers 1 and 3 in 2006 and 2009, but even 2009 is such a long time ago now that I\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be anything you remember. Right? Anyway\u2026 jerboas \u2013 properly, Dipodidae \u2013 are Northern Hemisphere members of the mouse lineage (Myodonta), famous for their prodigious leaping ability and also for their remarkably odd proportions. There are about 50 species (assuming the inclusion of jumping mice and birch mice, an issue I\u2019m avoiding here). Indisputable jerboas (that is, excluding jumping mice and birch mice) are fully bipedal but still diverse enough to be grouped into three, four or five subfamilies differing in skull form, toe count, anti-predator behaviour (freezing versus leaping) and much else besides (Lebedev et al . 2012). The name Dipodidae comes from \u2018dipodes\u2019 meaning \u2018two-footed\u2019, the term apparently used for jerboas by Herodotus (writing sometime around 430 BCE). Given that many animals share the characteristic of having two feet, I presume this was a reference to bipedality. In comparison, this is not so common among mammals. Portrait of Lesser Egyptian jerboa Jaculus jaculus , again from Hanney (1975) . Jaculus is not an especially big jerboa but some of its cousins - like the Great jerboa Allactaga major of central and western Asia and eastern Europe - can reach 45 cm in total length. Credit: Hanney 1975 \nJerboas are specialised for saltation, or leaping. Despite a body length of mostly around 10 cm, jerboas can cover about 3 m in a single leap. This is a neat and useful trick if you want to cross large distances on hot sand, but of course jerboas are mostly nocturnal, and the predominant function of saltation in jerboas is to move quickly away from predators. One species \u2013 the Rough-legged jerboa Dipus sagitta \u2013 exhibits particularly interesting predator-avoidance behaviour: it not only leaps from predators, but, as it leaps, grabs at over-hanging foliage with its teeth and forelimbs, and then clambers into the vegetation to hide ( Hanney 1975 ). The superficially bird-like tarsometarsus -- though with a characteristically mammalian tarsus -- of the tridactyl jerboa Jaculus . Another illustration from Hanney (1975) . Credit: Hanney 1975 \nThe remarkably long hindlimbs of jerboas in part owe their length to radically long, weird feet, in particular to the metatarsus (the part formed of the normally separate metatarsals). The metatarsus in most jerboas is a single element where the individual metatarsals have fused together, forming a long \u2018cannon bone\u2019 [UPDATE: not \u2018canon\u2019!] with three distal condyles. Side toes are absent in these particular jerboas (species of Paradipus , Dipus , Stylodipus , Eremodipus and Jaculus ), so they have tridactyl feet. As you can see from the diagram here, tridactyl jerboa feet look remarkably like those of birds. This similarity has not been lost on ornithologists (Rich 1973) and is a remarkable case of convergent evolution. If the proximal end of the metatarsus were broken off (and this bit is the giveaway, as it of course shows the presence of tarsals charactestically mammalian in form and number), I suspect that even some experienced zoologists would be fooled into misidentifying a jerboa metatarsus as an avian one. Not all jerboas are like this, by the way: in the bizarre Long-eared jerboa Euchoreutes naso (sole member of the group Euchoreutinae), short first and fifth digits are still present. Portrait of Long-eared jerboa Euchoreutes naso by Joseph Smit. As with all older illustrations of this species, this illustration seemingly doesn\u2019t make the ears large enough! Credit: Josef Smit Wikimedia \nIncidentally, most of the cervical vertebrae in jerboas are fused together as well, and in some dwarf jerboas (members of a group \u2013 Cardiocraniinae \u2013 that seems to be the sister-group to the remaining jerboas; Lebedev et al . 2012) the first three dorsal vertebrae are also fused together, and to the fused cervicals. I don\u2019t know why this is, but it might be to prevent dislocation or jarring during the violent acceleration and deceleration incurred during leaping and bounding. \nExperts have disagreed over exactly where jerboas fit in phylogeny. There\u2019s enough to say about that issue and its implications that I\u2019m going to leave it for now. I promise I\u2019ll come back to it. It involves the jumping mice and birch mice, some of which are not that similar to classic jerboas and are associated with forests and grasslands more than deserts. I may need to do some recalculating, but the figure is at least roughly correct. Buy merchandise here . Credit: Darren Naish \nMore rodents soon!

A team of researchers has just announced a new paint-on battery design. The technique could change the way batteries are produced and eliminate restrictions on the surfaces used for energy storage. The paint-on battery, like all lithium ion batteries, consists of five layers: a positive current collector, a cathode that attracts positively charged ions, an ion-conducting separator, an anode to attract negative ions, and a negative current collector. For each layer, the challenge was to find a way to mix the electrically conductive material with various polymers to create a paint that could be sprayed onto surfaces. Neelam Singh, a member of the team of materials scientists and chemists from Rice University in Houston and Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium and lead author of the paper, says, \"It was really exciting to find out. Can we really paint a battery on various surfaces and convert any object into a storage device?\" Singh says her team's work is filling a need in the socially critical field of energy storage for new battery designs. \"We find that the focus of research is now shifting towards integration of batteries,\" she says. That is, people are trying to design batteries that can be built into a variety of different objects. Several teams are working to make thin and flexible batteries as well as batteries that can be incorporated into textiles. Solar energy is one of the applications that researchers are particularly interested in. Solar panels can require large surface areas, and the Rice team's design is an efficient way to collect and store energy in this realm. To test their design, they applied the battery paints onto ceramic bathroom tiles, glass, a flexible transparency film, stainless steel and the side of a beer stein. In each case, the battery worked. In one experiment, they hooked a solar cell to one of the batteries and powered an LED display. Singh said the biggest challenge was to make a battery that was both stable and powerful: \"It was not very easy to get all the layers on top of each other without interfering with their capacity or compromising the performance of the battery.\" There were safety concerns as well. Many lithium ion batteries use aluminum as a positive current collector, but aluminum microparticles can be lung irritants, so using them in aerosol paint would be hazardous. Instead, the researchers relied on carbon nanotubes. Lithium cobalt oxide was used as the cathode, commercially available gel electrolytes as the separator, lithium titanium oxide as the anode, and copper as the negative current collector. The approach is detailed in the June 28 issue of Scientific Reports . ( Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group.) Singh thinks that the Rice team's battery is a game-changer because it is energy efficient for its volume and can be applied to objects of many different compositions and shapes. Vilas Pol, a materials scientist at Argonne National Laboratory who was not affiliated with the study, agrees that the new design is exciting, describing it as \"an exceptional and notable concept in the arena of battery design and integration.\" But for now paint-on batteries are not quite ready to hit the shelves at your local hardware store. For one, the electrolyte separator layer is not yet oxygen stable. It would explode if it came into contact with air, so special conditions are necessary when creating the battery. Singh says the team currently is working to make all the materials less reactive to air and moisture and more environmentally friendly. She adds that other groups are working on developing paint-on solar cells. Then, she envisions \"paintable solar cells on top of paintable solar batteries.\" Houses could become solar-energy capture-and-storage devices.

Despite considerable progress, however, several fundamental questions remain: What is imagination, and how do we measure it? Is imagination a fixed ability, or can it be enhanced through targeted intervention? \nThese questions inspired a recent gathering of leading experts on the neuroscience of imagination in Philadelphia for an \u201cImagination Retreat,\u201d featuring neuroscientists Jessica Andrews-Hanna, Roger Beaty, Randy Buckner, Kalina Christoff, Chandra Sripada, and Diana Tamir. The meeting was organized by Scott Barry Kaufman, Martin Seligman, and Elizabeth Hyde from the Imagination Institute , and was funded by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation , and it consisted of a series of discussions that took place over the course of a three-day period. \nThis report highlights some of the common themes from the retreat, with a focus on the brain network that is thought to give rise to imagination: the so-called \"default network\". The retreat began by discussing the history of the default network and its serendipitous discovery in the late 1990s by Marcus Raichle and other neuroscientists, including one of the Imagination retreat participants, Randy Buckner. Participants explored the various cognitive functions that have since been ascribed to the default network\u2014from mind-wandering to mental simulation to creative cognition\u2014and their experiences as scientists who study these complex mental phenomena. The retreat discussions also focused on the measurement and cultivation of imagination, which touched on practical applications in educational contexts. The report concludes with a central theme that emerged from the retreat: the need for a new field of imagination science. \nRead the full report, prepared by Roger Beaty, here . \nHere are video highlights of the event: \nRetreat Participants: \nJessica Andrews-Hanna, Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Cognitive, Science Program at the University of Arizona Drake Baer, Senior writer at Thrive Global Roger Beaty, Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University Kalina Christoff, Professor in the Psychology Department and the Brain Research Centre at the University of British Columbia Elizabeth Hyde, Research Specialist, Imagination Institute, University of Pennsylvania Scott Barry Kaufman, Scientific Director, Imagination Institute, University of Pennsylvania Martin Seligman, Director, Positive Psychology Center and the Zellerbach Family Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania Chandra Sripada, Associate Professor in Psychiatry and Philosophy at the University of Michigan Diana Tamir, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Princeton University \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Curtis/Library of Congress/Wikimedia Commons Advertisement \nEditor's note: The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation , an online publication covering the latest research. \nThe theory that the Americas were populated by humans crossing from Siberia to Alaska across a land bridge was first proposed as far back as 1590, and has been generally accepted since the 1930s. \nBut genetic evidence shows there is no direct ancestral link between the people of ancient East Asia and modern Native Americans. A comparison of DNA from 600 modern Native Americans with ancient DNA recovered from a late Stone Age human skeleton from Mal'ta near Lake Baikal in southern Siberia shows that Native Americans diverged genetically from their Asian ancestors around 25,000 years ago, just as the last ice age was reaching its peak. \nBased on archaeological evidence, humans did not survive the last ice age\u2019s peak in northeastern Siberia, and yet there is no evidence they had reached Alaska or the rest of the New World either. While there is evidence to suggest northeast Siberia was inhabited during a warm period about 30,000 years ago before the last ice age peaked, after this the archaeological record goes silent, and only returns 15,000 years ago, after the last ice age ended. \nSo where did the ancestors of the Native Americans go for 15,000 years, after they split from the rest of their Asian relatives? \nSurviving in Beringia As John Hoffecker , Dennis O'Rourke and I argue in an article for Science , the answer seems to be that they lived on the Bering Land Bridge , the region between Siberia and Alaska that was dry land when sea levels were lower, as much of the world\u2019s freshwater was locked up in ice, but which now lies underneath the waters of the Bering and Chukchi Seas. This theory has become increasingly supported by genetic evidence . Credit: NOAA/Wikimedia Commons \nThe Bering Land Bridge, also known as central part of Beringia, is thought to have been up to 600 miles wide. Based on evidence from sediment cores drilled into the now submerged landscape, it seems that here and in some adjacent regions of Alaska and Siberia the landscape at the height of the last glaciation 21,000 years ago was shrub tundra \u2013 as found in Arctic Alaska today. \nThis is dominated by dwarf shrubs such as willow and birch, only a few centimeters tall. There is evidence that there may have been some stands of spruce trees in these regions too in some protected microhabitats, where temperatures were milder than the regions around. The presence of a particular group of beetle species that live in shrub tundra habitats today in Alaska, and are associated with a specific range of temperatures, also supports the idea that the area was a refuge for both flora and fauna. \nThis kind of vegetation would not have supported the large, grazing animals \u2013 woolly mammoth, woolly rhino, Pleistocene horses, camels, and bison. These animals lived on the vegetation of the steppe-tundra which dominated the interior of Alaska and the Yukon, as well as interior regions of northeast Siberia. This shrub tundra would have supported elk, perhaps some bighorn sheep, and small mammals. But it had the one resource people needed most to keep warm: wood. \nThe wood and bark of dwarf shrubs would have been used to start fires that burned large mammal bones. The fats inside these bones won\u2019t ignite unless they are heated to high temperatures, and for that you need a woody fire. And there is evidence from archaeological sites that people burned bones as fuel \u2013 the charred remains of leg bones have been found in many ancient hearths. It is the heat from these fires that kept these intrepid hunter-gatherers alive through the bitter cold of Arctic winter nights. \nEscape to America The last ice age ended and the land bridge began to disappear beneath the sea, some 13,000 years ago. Global sea levels rose as the vast continental ice sheets melted, liberating billions of gallons of fresh water. As the land bridge flooded, the entire Beringian region grew more warm and moist, and the shrub tundra vegetation spread rapidly, out-competing the steppe-tundra plants that had dominated the interior lowlands of Beringia. \nWhile this spelled the end of the woolly mammoths and other large grazing animals, it probably also provided the impetus for human migration. As retreating glaciers opened new routes into the continent, humans travelled first into the Alaskan interior and the Yukon, and ultimately south out of the Arctic region and toward the temperate regions of the Americas. The first definitive archaeological evidence we have for the presence of people beyond Beringia and interior Alaska comes from this time, about 13,000 years ago. \nThese people are called Paleoindians by archaeologists. The genetic evidence records mutations in mitochondrial DNA passed from mother to offspring that are present in today\u2019s Native Americans but not in the Mal'ta remains. This indicates a population isolated from the Siberian mainland for thousands of years, who are the direct ancestors of nearly all of the Native American tribes in both North and South America \u2013 the original \u201cfirst peoples\u201d. \nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

Columbus had a rich maritime history to draw from for his voyages. How did this impact his routes? By Krystal D'Costa on October 9, 2017 Share on Facebook Credit: annahoover4 Pixabay Advertisement \nChristopher Columbus embarked on four voyages to find a direct route from Europe to Asia. On his first trip in 1492, he wrecked the Santa Maria on Hispaniola and left behind a number of crew members in a small settlement. He hurried back in 1493 with a larger expedition to these men (and found them dead) but the possibility of gold had drawn a mix of new settlers who established themselves on Hispaniola. His third voyage in 1498 took him to Trinidad and within reach of the South American continent, and his final voyage in 1502 brought him down to central America and Jamaica before he ultimately gave up. Though he died utterly disillusioned and despondent in his failure, over the course of a decade he had laid the seeds of discovery and domination that would completely alter the course of history in the Caribbean. \nAs we renegotiate and reevaluate history, Columbus has been the target of significant criticism in expanding the colonial reach of Spain and establishing the forces that decimated the native populations of the Caribbean. To add to this narrative, evidence suggests the discoveries of his third voyage were accidental and drew heavily upon a body of knowledge from Portuguese sailors. \nAs a young man, Columbus established himself as a sailor in the Mediterranean. In 1476 he was sent on a commercial voyage headed for England that was attacked by marauders off the coast of Portugal. He washed up near Lisbon where he settled and established a chart-making business. He supplemented his income with with sailing contracts from the Italians and Portuguese, and historians believe this period was instrumental in shaping his ventures in the Americas. From the Portuguese he would have had access to a wealth of maritime learnings and tools, including the mariner's compass, the nautical chart based on compass directions and estimated distances, and the sand-glass which made it possible to calculate the distance traveled when a ship was blown off course. \nBefore he left on his third voyage, he stopped for six days in Madeira. While his original objective for this trip was a return to Hispaniola with perishable supplies for the settlers and then to pursue exploration west of Cuba, this time in Portugal may have changed his course. \nSailing from Madeira, when he reached the Canaries he made a sudden decision to split the mission: he would send three ships to Hispaniola and sail with three ships south across the equator. This appears to be a sudden decision based on the logs: This split is not mentioned in any prior planning documents. The distribution of perishable goods on his vessels suggests that he intended the entire convoy to sail to the Caribbean. If he was planning to split the mission, he would have loaded the supplies on the larger ships and kept the smaller ships free for exploration. And he specifically notes that smaller ships would have been better suited for exploration. (He had learned this with the loss of the Santa Maria.) He specifically says that this was not an exploration expedition and notes that he looks forward to more exploratory ventures. \nDespite these things he sailed south from Cape Verde instead of taking the westward course he had employed on his previous trip. His objectives, he said, were to look for islands and continents. He likely was driven by the belief held by King John of Portugal that there was a continent to the south. However he had known of this route since 1493, so the change in the route was likely spurred by additional information. He had to have been relatively confident of his success and the resulting rewards and favors that would fall to him to shift course in this way. \nHistorians believe that the route Columbus plotted was too perfect to have been left to chance. It was a route that could only have been plotted if he had full knowledge of winds, currents, and hazards of the Central Atlantic. It's the route that the Portuguese would employ during the sixteenth-century to sail from Brazil to India. But more to the point, he gave up on the route and turned west sooner than he had projected, putting him on a course that landed him on Trinidad. If he had been confident of the route, or intended it from the start and properly stocked for it, he would not have had the burden of perishables weighing on him and would have stuck with it. \nColumbus landed in Trinidad in July 1493. He had set his course for Dominica, abandoning a southernly course, when his servant climbed into the crow's nest and spied the three mountains of Trinidad. If not for these peaks, he would have passed the land by completely, and so it was somewhat of an accident that he found this island nation. And while he would site the landmass of South America, he actually turned north without ever landing day because his supplies were so low. \nThere are additional hints of the Portuguese influence on this voyage in the names he gives to the geographic features of the area. There is, for example, a reference to \"Tramontana\" in his notes, which appears to be a corruption of the Portuguese \"tres montanhas\" that marked Trinidad. Columbus named the island for the Holy Trinity, under whose auspices he had set out. \nHe identifies an island 26 leagues away to the northeast from the eastern end of the Gulf of Paria. He names it Belaforma, or beautiful shape. But there is no indication that Columbus came close to this island based on the route he undertood which cast him north. This island is Tobago, and at that distance he would have been hard pressed to see details that support the name. \nThe Portuguese also held a tradition of naming features after the saint on whose day the discovery was made. Columbus names Sebeta (a potential mistake on St. Isabel) and Margarita on a schedule that breaks with this tradition, suggesting that these names were already established. He also initially named the Gulf of Paria the gulf \"de la Ballena\" or \"the gulf of the Whale.\" But no records indicate he saw a whale, and the name may have been a carry-over from a previous expedition that saw a stranded whale from the Antarctic by way of the Benguela and Equatorial currents. \nHistory is written by the records that remain. Perhaps Columbus was verifying documented hearsay. But given the risks involved with sea voyages, its more likely that these were honest efforts that pre-existed his landing in Trinidad and subsequent exploration of the area. Whatever the truth, there is considerable evidence to support the influence of other maritime traditions on the expeditions of Columbus. He has come to represent a great deal about this age of exploration, which includes a broad reach people and politics. \nComments have been disabled on Anthropology in Practice, but you can always join the community on Facebook . \n-- \nReferenced: \nCanny, N.

As the old adage goes, where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. Where there is effect, there must be cause. This same logic is applied to the search for the Higgs boson. This book chronicles the search \u2013 and demonstrates the power of a good theory. In July 2012, a Higgs-like particle was found near the energies scientists expected to find it. Now, armed with better evidence and better questions, the scientific process continues. This eBook, The Higgs Boson: Searching for the God Particle , gathers our best reporting to explain that process \u2013 the theories, the search, the discovery, the ongoing questions.

In the U.S. these living libraries include 91,000 bacterial and fungal strains in Peoria, Ill., as well as 13,000 fungal strains in Ithaca, N.Y., and 7,500 wild yeasts at the University of California, Davis. Researchers have used strains from such publicly accessible culture collections to develop penicillin as well as the CRISPR gene-editing systems and the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) DNA-amplifying technique. \nBut as government priorities apparently change, and as the federal money that historically created and preserved many of these biological resource repositories in the U.S. dries up, their infrastructure is at risk of deteriorating. With less funding for daily curation\u2014such as occasionally reviving strains to maintain viability, in addition to licensing and distributing them\u2014the less accessible these collections become. Plant pathologist David Geiser oversees The Pennsylvania State University\u2019s collection of 20,000 samples of species in the genus Fusarium , a ubiquitous soil fungus that can be pathogenic. When the collection\u2019s previous curator retired, Geiser found that grant funding for a full-time replacement was practically nonexistent. \u201cThere\u2019s a national crisis that\u2019s going on with culture collections,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for a long time; it\u2019s just gotten worse lately.\u201d \nOne way to help maintain at least some microbe libraries would be raising user fees. Private U.S. collections set up to generate revenue, however, often charge researchers $250 to $350 per strain \u2014which can deter early-stage investigations and historically underserved institutions. And privatization removes obligations to distribute strains publicly, making it easier to keep them secret. Sourcing strains overseas poses legal and logistical problems, and isolating them from nature or getting them from peers runs the risk of using nonidentical or mutated microbes\u2014potentially compounding reproducibility problems in research. \nUnlike some other countries, the U.S. has no centralized facility to store strains. And there is no microbial equivalent of the giant Arctic vault in Svalbard, Norway, where the nonprofit Global Crop Diversity Trust preserves crucial food-crop seeds in the event of natural or man-made disasters. But Kevin McCluskey, a researcher at Kansas State University who oversees the school\u2019s Fungal Genetics Stock Center (a collection of 25,000 filamentous fungi, including mostly mutant strains), says some microbes are also important for agriculture because they fend off pathogens and harmful compounds produced by fungi. \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of things we\u2019re learning how to do with microbes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need those publicly available\u2014not behind a paywall.\u201d To that end McCluskey has been organizing a National Science Foundation\u2013funded project called the U.S. Culture Collection Network, which aims to preserve vulnerable collections, sponsor related workshops and training sessions, and implement a long-range management plan to keep collections open. \nPart of the value of living microbe collections is that they can be used to map genetic changes a strain undergoes over time as a result of selection pressure from fungicide or antibiotics. As such, microbes may have applications that scientists have yet to discover or envision. McCluskey says these collections are priceless; he can make a perfect copy of a given strain\u2014almost as if microbe \u201clibrarians\u201d were freely lending out exact copies of the sole surviving first edition of a book\u2014while safely keeping the original in perpetuity. This, McCluskey says, is critical for reproducibility and future scholarship. Andrew Carnegie once advocated for public libraries, and McCluskey thinks it is high time for funders\u2014such as Jeff Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur and founder of Amazon\u2014to invest in an open network of public microbe collections. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of seeds in Svalbard,\u201d McCluskey says. \u201cBut we want a microbe vault.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew carnegie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david geiser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin mccluskey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff bezos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geiser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccluskey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "global crop diversity trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fungal genetics stock center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. culture collection network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national science foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "n.y.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ill.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ithaca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "svalbard", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T13:53:21.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35f7b4c998f52091c747f3d14df41c3f3ae3ce35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcTsOZxIRaDKBK3JcNgD0fP1OrDOZTfmz3w7QT03QWY95MPqb0tkGhew.stYsMPTadlsrubvU9eOkUlEH1qQkD242D3KV4.C4FOO_AkoCgCYYiXjB5yKZrXIAkZp_Tp84-", "site_full": "blogs.scientificamerican.com", "site": "scientificamerican.com", "site_section": "http://www.scientificamerican.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Scientific American Content: Global", "title": "New Telescope \"Gives Back the Sky\" to City-Dwellers", "title_full": "New Telescope \"Gives Back the Sky\" to City-Dwellers", "published": "2017-10-10T14:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 4457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 494, "comments": 0, "shares": 494}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 15}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35f7b4c998f52091c747f3d14df41c3f3ae3ce35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcTsOZxIRaDKBK3JcNgD0fP1OrDOZTfmz3w7QT03QWY95MPqb0tkGhew.stYsMPTadlsrubvU9eOkUlEH1qQkD242D3KV4.C4FOO_AkoCgCYYiXjB5yKZrXIAkZp_Tp84-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lee Billings", "published": "2017-10-10T14:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Telescope \"Gives Back the Sky\" to City-Dwellers", "text": "Print Share via The Whirlpool Galaxy as seen through the eyepiece of Unistellar\u2019s eVscope from the Observatoire des Baronnies Proven\u00e7ales in France. Credit: Unistellar Advertisement \nAny astronomy buff will tell you about the first time they looked through a telescope. What many of them won\u2019t say, though, is how disappointing those first looks can be. I remember my own all too well, from when I was a boy. It was a glimpse from my suburban front yard of the majestic stellar nursery we call the Orion Nebula, hard-won after close to an hour of setting up, pointing and focusing a modest refractor telescope my father had purchased at a department store. Through the eyepiece, the nebula didn\u2019t look at all like the crisp, colorful images I had seen in books and magazines. Instead, it was a gray smudge, easily mistaken for a wisp of cirrus cloud, its faint light washed out against the blue glare of a nearby mercury\u2013vapor streetlamp. After that, the telescope just gathered dust\u2014and with it, most of my desire to delve deeper into amateur astronomy. \nAt least that was the case until last month, when I tried a new sort of telescope at a stargazing party in a secluded spot of the sprawling Evergreens Cemetery in Brooklyn. Set up alongside several standard consumer models, the SETI Institute astronomer Franck Marchis is offering demonstrations of a prototype \u201cEnhanced Vision Telescope\u201d produced by the small French start-up Unistellar , where he also works as Chief Scientific Officer. Marchis is best known as the discoverer of multiple asteroids, and for coaxing remarkable observations from modest ground-based telescopes. He was the first to capture images of volcanic eruptions on Jupiter\u2019s moon, Io, without the aid of space telescopes or interplanetary probes, and is part of a vanguard of astronomers developing new technologies for imaging planets orbiting other stars. This night, however, he is merely serving as a celestial evangelist. \n\u201cWhat happened to you is what happens to almost everybody when they use a telescope to look at anything besides the moon and some of the planets,\u201d Marchis says when I tell him about my childhood experience. \u201cYou invest hundreds of dollars, you maybe drive far to get away from city lights, and you spend hours trying to align and calibrate your telescope to observe a galaxy or a nebula. You might think you\u2019ll see something like a pretty picture from the Hubble [Space Telescope]. But what you get is a blurry dot to show your kids or your wife or your partner, and they\u2019re disappointed. And then they\u2019re done!\u201d \nMarchis traces his own interest in astronomy to a late night of boyhood bonding with his father in the French countryside, watching without a telescope as the Earth\u2019s shadow tinted the full moon red during a lunar eclipse. It was \u201cthe first moment in my life where I felt things were really happening in the sky,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere I realized we are on this small rock we call Earth orbiting a star, and that there must be countless other worlds around all the other stars out there.\u201d Not long after, Marchis would be stargazing more seriously, staring at the rings of Saturn through his first telescope. \nCalled the \u201ceVscope\u201d (pronounced Ee-Vee Scope) for short, Unistellar\u2019s product outwardly appears to be just a typical 4.5-inch Newtonian reflector\u2014a simple small telescope that, along with its tripod, easily fits inside a backpack. But a peek through its eyepiece reveals the eVscope\u2019s power: Using a proprietary system of sensors, optics and specialized software, the telescope can amplify and display the accumulated light from a faint target over time, stacking up and processing hundreds of images to correct for instrumental jitter and smeared exposures to build up vivid, sharp views that rival those from far larger and more expensive equipment. And, as Marchis intends to show with his demonstration from a Brooklyn graveyard, the technology even works under poor viewing conditions\u2014such as in and around New York City , where the glare of city lights is so oppressive that even on clear nights one can practically count on fingers and toes all the stars visible to the naked eye. (The technology works so well, in fact, that Unistellar\u2019s eVscope has managed to capture and display images of faraway Pluto in its eyepiece as a dim and distant dot hanging in the light-polluted skies over Marseilles, France, and San Francisco.) \n\u201cRemember, this telescope isn\u2019t just about pretty pictures,\u201d Marchis says. \u201cIt could also lead to new ways of doing science.\u201d According to Marchis, by the time the eVscope hits stores it should be capable of imaging objects as faint as about 15 apparent magnitude\u2014that is, as faint in Earth\u2019s skies as a 100-watt lightbulb seen from 30,000 kilometers away. That would, among other things, allow it to image, track and study tens of thousands of known asteroids, and to discover new ones as well. Through a partnership with the SETI Institute, eVscope users will have the option of automatically uploading their observations to an online database for use by amateur and professional astronomers alike. \u201cWe\u2019ll build it up slowly, with a thousand eVscopes providing millions of frames for any given region of sky that can be combined to get good signal to noise,\u201d Marchis says. \u201cWe could use it to search for Earth-threatening asteroids and comets, stellar occultations, supernovae, variable stars; maybe even things we can scarcely imagine\u2014a flash of light, a laser pulse from another cosmic civilization? Who knows what we might find\u2014it\u2019s not like we have been observing the sky continuously at these magnitudes.\u201d \nTo aid the acquisition and construction of that database, Unistellar is developing a semiautonomous \u201cField Recognition System\u201d for the eVscope that uses GPS data to help point the telescope and identify objects of interest. That system, though, is not yet fully integrated into the prototype; during the demonstration Marchis guides the eVscope by hand, navigating with the help of an app on his smartphone. \nBefore being cut short by encroaching clouds, his demo reaches its zenith with a view of the Ring Nebula, a one-light-year\u2013wide shell of gas cast off from a dying star about 2,000 light-years from Earth. After zooming in on the nebula\u2019s celestial coordinates, Marchis toggles the telescope\u2019s enhanced light-amplification mode, and steps back to let me look through the eyepiece. Within seconds, the nebula materializes from a glittering field of background stars like a polished disk of turquoise and coral nestled in black, diamond-studded velvet. The colors come from ionized nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen and other gases that had once been in the dying star\u2019s atmosphere\u2014and probably in some accompanying planets, too\u2014now stripped away and set aglow by intense ultraviolet light from the star\u2019s slowly cooling white-hot core. A bit more than five billion years from now, astronomers guess, our sun and solar system will experience a similar fate. One by one, the other stargazers line up to peer at the stellar memento mori. A few even take out their smartphones to snap pictures of the nebula through the eyepiece. \nSteps away, another telescope more than twice as large as Unistellar\u2019s is also trained on the Ring Nebula. Through its excellent but old-fashioned optics, the nebula appears as a vaguely doughnut-shaped gray mist against a background of pale stars. Like many faint sky objects, here it is best seen indirectly, slipping into invisibility when focused on and only appearing again out of the corner of the eye, as its trickles of photons fall on the retina\u2019s more light-sensitive edges rather than its more color-sensitive center. The difference is striking, and illustrative of why galaxies and other deep-sky objects can be so problematic to appreciate through ordinary telescopes. The nebula\u2019s vivid hues are there waiting to be seen, hidden due to the inherent limitations of the human eye. Paired with digital camera, a motorized star tracker and a laptop running imaging-processing software, any telescope could deliver a serviceable colorful image of the Ring Nebula in a matter of minutes\u2014but not in a real-time glance through an eyepiece. \n\u201cThere is no magic in what we are doing,\u201d Marchis says later, noting that high-powered amateur astronomers at past Unistellar events have replicated many of the eVscope\u2019s feats, albeit with much more (and far pricier) equipment and greater effort. \u201cWe are taking the technology that professional astronomers have been using for years, and integrating it into a small, affordable telescope that anyone can use. The eVscope is meant to be equivalent to a smartphone, but for astronomy.\u201d \nThe company, Marchis says, hopes to bring the eVscope to market in fall 2018, at a price point similar to the latest iPhone or a mid-tier laptop. But, of course, he and others at Unistellar say they aren\u2019t making enhanced-vision telescopes for the money. Rather, they are trying to restore something they feel people\u2014particularly those in bustling, starlight-starved cities\u2014are at risk of losing: A connection with the heavens above. \n\u201cAs an astronomer, I\u2019m biased, of course, but it does matter, being able to see the stars,\u201d Marchis says after his demonstration ends. \u201cWhen people lose that, they forget where they really are. They forget that they live on a tiny planet around a little star in a huge galaxy, and that we as human beings are more than a bunch of apes who want to buy fancy new cars or the latest Apple phone. We are part of a bigger picture. It\u2019s a big moment in your life, when you see and feel that for the first time. Exploring the entire universe can start with something tiny, like looking through a telescope. That\u2019s what happened to me when I saw my first eclipse with my father. Maybe we can make it happen for today\u2019s kids, too. For everyone. We want to give back the sky.\u201d \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Outdated electrical systems groan under the strain of large medical devices, possibly compromising a hospital\u2019s power. \n\u201cI think there is a great risk for every medical device donation that it\u2019s going to hurt the recipient,\u201d says Robert Malkin, a professor of the practice of biomedical engineering at Duke University. \nRecently, a study of seven hospitals in Haiti found only 30 percent of the 115 pieces of medical equipment donated after the 2010 earthquake were working and 14 percent of the equipment could not be repaired. The study also found that some donated devices, such as incubators for premature babies, could never work in the hospitals, because they required a higher electrical voltage than is standard in Haiti. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates ( pdf ) that as much as 80 percent of medical equipment in some countries is donated or funded through foreign sources, but only 10 percent to 30 percent of the donations are ever put into operation. \u201cThere is no question that you can donate effectively,\u201d Malkin says, adding the caveat that it takes a lot of effort to make sure everything is done right. For example, Malkin says organizations need to know what recipient hospitals or countries need. They also need to ensure the recipients have access to the right accessories and supplies to make the devices work properly. People need to be trained to use the equipment. And, of course, it also has to be shipped, delivered and installed. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of things to get right, and you need to do that with every piece of equipment,\u201d he says. \nAddressing the problem Currently, WHO spells out the four principles of a good medical equipment donation ( pdf ): respect the recipient\u2019s request; assure the donation will benefit the recipient; keep an open line of communication; and ensure quality. Malkin is part of the group tasked with rewriting those principles, which have not been updated since 2000. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to shift a lot more responsibility to the recipient,\u201d Malkin says. Hospitals and medical centers requesting medical equipment donations would be expected to make sure they can repair the devices and get spare parts, he adds. Some countries have already stepped in to put a stop to donations of used medical equipment and devices from other countries. For example, some don\u2019t allow incubators nor x-ray and dialysis machines to be shipped to their hospitals. \nBut Malkin says even new medical device donations come with risks for recipients, including not having access to the right spare parts such as the correct operating-room lightbulbs. \u201cThese are not trivial parts to find,\u201d he notes. Instead, he says his organization, Engineering World Health (EWH) , which works to improve care at hospitals in the developing world, has stopped shipping a lot of equipment overseas. \u201cIn EWH we feel that it\u2019s more powerful to train the staff of the hospital to fix the equipment they have. So we ship very little new equipment,\u201d he says. \nRwanda\u2019s trial run In 2009 EWH went to Rwanda to start training hospital technicians to manage, fix and maintain medical equipment. \u201cWe don\u2019t have biomedical engineering courses in our universities or in our colleges,\u201d says Didier Mukama, country director for EWH in Rwanda. \u201cThis was the first time there was formal academic training done here in Rwanda.\u201d \nBefore EWH came to Rwanda technicians only handled electrical and plumbing problems, Mukama says. When medical equipment broke, hospitals would just request a new donation from another organization. \u201cBasic things like the inventory of medical equipment were not even done, because most of the medical technicians didn\u2019t even know the name of the equipment,\u201d he says. \nMalkin and his colleagues, who have been following the effect of the training on hospitals, says they\u2019ve seen the amount of out-of-service equipment fall by almost half, and the technicians\u2019 productivity more than double. Mukamasays the goal is for EWH to train two technicians from each of the country\u2019s public hospitals. Several have already graduated, and dozens are still in training. \u201cI\u2019m really happy with what has been achieved,\u201d he adds. \u201cBefore most of the technicians were not even allowed to touch the equipment, but now they are able to do most of the troubleshooting.\u201d \nStill, not everything is perfect. Mukamasays there are devices in disrepair because technicians have trouble finding spare parts. \u201cI think the big elephant in the room that nobody had really figured out is spare parts,\u201d Malkin says. \nAside from on-the-ground training, Malkin says he also attends medical technology conferences to present EWH\u2019s work. Currently, about 130 organizations send medical equipment overseas, he says. Some have adopted responsible practices. \u201cI think we\u2019re making some progress,\u201d he adds.

Now, the tropical durian ( Durio zibethinus ) has had its genome sequenced \u2014 and the analysis reveals exactly what\u2019s responsible for the fruit\u2019s distinctive stench. The sequence, reported by researchers in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, should also allow scientists to identify genes involved in disease resistance and drought tolerance, the team says, as well as flavour profiles. This information is important to growers in southeast Asia, where the durian is a major crop. \nAlthough highly popular as a food, the large, spiny, tropical durian is banned from hotels and public transport in Singapore and Malaysia, because of its penetratingly pungent odour. \u201cIt has been described as decaying onion-like, rotten eggs, sulfury, and like fried shallots,\u201d says geneticist Bin Tean Teh of the Duke\u2013National University of Singapore (NUS) Medical School in Singapore, whose team published the genome sequence on October 9 in Nature Genetics . \u201cFirst-time visitors to the region sometimes confuse it with a gas or sewage leak.\u201d \nThe team analysed the genome of the Musang King variety of durian, which is considered a delicacy in Malaysia and Singapore. The resulting sequence reveals that D. zibethinus is closely related to the cotton and cacao plants. But it contains more copies of genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile sulfur compounds, a major component of the durian\u2019s scent. A study of gene expression showed that sulfur- and flavour-related pathways were switched on more strongly in the Musang King when compared with two other varieties, or cultivars, of tropical durian, including the sweeter Monthong type, which is preferred in Thailand. \nThere are more than 200 different varieties of tropical durian, which command a wide range of prices, and the latest research could help in the development of tests that can reliably distinguish between them, says Ahimsa Campos-Arceiz, a tropical ecologist at the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus in Semenyih. It could also aid in the cultivation of \u201cnew and interesting\u201d variations of the fruit, he says. Scents of sulfur \nThe work also showed that levels of smelly sulfur-containing compounds called disulfides that are produced in the fruit increase concomitantly with the expression of ripening genes. In a ripe fruit, the expression of one key sulfur-related gene was more than 2,000 times higher than in other parts of the plant. \nWhy should this be the case? Campos-Arceiz, whose team published a study on October 3 showing that the endangered island flying fox ( Pteropus hypomelanus ) is an important pollinator of the tropical durian in Malaysia, thinks that it might be to attract specific consumers in the wild. \u201cDurians developed this intense and far-reaching smell as a way to advertise the presence of ripe fruits and attract animals that occur at very low densities in the rainforests,\u201d he says. Pollinated by bats and dispersed by elephants, the durian is \u201ca beautiful example\u201d of cooperation between plant and animal species, he adds. \nBesides D. zibethinus, there are at least 30 other Durio species, some edible, some inedible. \u201cUnfortunately, several of these species are endangered,\u201d says cell biologist Patrick Tan , also at Duke\u2013NUS, and a co-author on the sequencing paper. \u201cWe hope to work with experts in the region to characterize the genomes of these other species, to protect their biodiversity and gain further insight into these fascinating plants.\u201d \nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on October 9, 2017.

Just the amount is incredible\u2014 72 million tons of plastic packaging is produced every year, and around one-third of that ends up in the ocean . That\u2019s the equivalent of a garbage truck full of plastic being dumped into the ocean every single minute, every day of the year. And once it\u2019s in the ocean, it is broken down into smaller pieces by sun and salt; it becomes microplastic and gets incorporated in the food chain. \nOne-third of fish caught in the UK are contaminated with microplastic. Oysters and mussels are contaminated. A recent study found 83 percent of drinking water samples around the world were contaminated . Contamination of sea water itself means there is microplastic in our table salt . Sea minerals and fish meal, the foundation of many agricultural fertilizers and feed for livestock and pets, are contaminated. \nWe used science to create a material that lasts forever, and then we throw it away, all day, every day. That doesn't make any sense. And of course, there is no \u201caway.\u201d Every single piece of plastic that has ever been created is still with us. \nSo what do we do about this problem that is choking our ocean? There are many proven and practical ways to deal with plastic pollution. My favorite technological solution is the Inner Harbor Water Wheel in Baltimore, Maryland . It uses river currents and floating booms to funnel plastic and other trash into a water wheel and then into a dumpster that can be hauled away. Very simple. Very effective. These should be at the mouth of every river, preventing plastic from getting to the sea. \nAnd if there is one thing we have learned from the incredible effort led by Afroz Shah to pick up almost 8,000 tons of trash from a beach in Mumbai, it's that beach cleanups are not to be scoffed at. Let\u2019s Do It , an organization I\u2019ve only just become aware of, has been quietly scaling up massive cleanups around the world since 2008. The Ocean Conservancy and Surfrider have also been mobilizing citizens for beach cleanups for decades. We should each pitch in and pick up. \nWe can also become more effective at reducing, reusing, recycling, and re-purposing existing plastic. But then there is the reality check that there is so much plastic already in the environment\u2014and so much of it is microplastic\u2014that it is nearly impossible to truly clean up. Our planet is already forever changed. \nWe can't go back to a world free of plastic pollution. But we can stop the problem from growing, and we can turn the trend around. To do that we really must break our addiction to plastic. We must refuse to use plastic. We must stop creating new plastic. This will require a major cultural shift\u2014the creation of new traditions, norms, trends, memes. A shift away from a culture that accepts things being disposable, away from ordering so many of our meals \u201cto go.\u201d \nAt the risk of sounding too romantic, we need a return to eating our meals and drinking our coffee while sitting and looking each other in the eye\u2014then actually washing the dishes! Of course, this also has lots of other benefits\u2014for our heath, well-being, for community-building\u2014beyond plastic reduction. \nBreaking our addiction will also require a major shift in government and corporate policies. It\u2019s time for a little less talk and a little more action . There is so much that can be done to alleviate this explosive plastic fiasco. \nWe can ban plastic straws ( #StopSucking ) and utensils as the city of Seattle just did .\" Ban plastic bags like Kenya just did . Ban plastic microbeads like the United States did . Ban plastic takeout containers like Hobart, Tasmania just did . Improve the quality of the drinking water that comes out of the tap, so people won\u2019t feel they have to drink bottled water to protect their health. \nLet\u2019s race to see which cities, states, nations, and corporations will be first to achieve all of the above. Let's follow those who are leading, and learn from them the practical nuance of how to make this shift away from plastic work in reality. It takes political will, visionary leadership. \nAs an advocate for social justice, I will note that while the stakes are high for all of us, they are often even higher for poor communities and communities of color on the coasts. They are the ones who live near the most polluted and plastic-choked waters; who are less likely to be able to filter carcinogenic microplastics out of their drinking water; who are more likely to live in neighborhoods without robust waste management and recycling services, where plastic trash just piles up and up. Ocean conservation is a social justice issue. \nSo it\u2019s time to take a leap, together, to envision a world without single-use plastic. Getting new plastic bags every time you buy groceries is ridiculous. Getting disposable plastic forks, plates, and bowls every time you eat a meal to-go is nuts. Using a plastic straw that will last forever for only a few seconds is crazy. And shipping water all over the world in little plastic bottles is totally absurd. People did just fine getting their food home from the store, eating outside their homes, and staying hydrated before all this plastic got involved. \nWith political will, a cultural shift, some scientific innovation, an eye to social justice, and by washing a few more dishes, we can work our way out of this enormous mess we humans have made. \nNote: This article is a slight adaptation of remarks given at the Our Ocean Conference in Malta, October 5-6, hosted by the European Union ( @EU_MARE ).

Similarly, according to the Economics and Statistics Administration of the US Department of Commerce only 24 per cent of STEM jobs are held by women , with individual disciplines like Engineering having a significantly worse gender bias. There\u2019s also extensive literature on biases against women in STEM , affecting all aspects of academia, including hiring, publishing, citation counts and teaching. \nGiven these disheartening statistics, it is clear that there is still a long way to go before we can even start thinking about gender equality in STEM. Why is it that I, a man in STEM, am writing about this? Because to me these statistics also show another thing: men, who are dominating these fields, have an obligation to support women in STEM and help level the playing field. But how can men help to facilitate change and support women in STEM? All the things I try to implement are the result of listening to women\u2014who sacrificed their spare time to educate me\u2014and taking their advice. Thus, maybe the single best, most actionable thing is this: step back, shut up, give women space, and listen to them. \nWhat can this look like on a more concrete level? Ask yourself about your own environments: is it men, including me, who are taking up all the airtime at meetings ? Chances are that this is the case, as women are interrupted more often than men and speak significantly less at professional meetings . So take a break and let others speak. To whom are you paying attention ? Is it the always same male crowd? For social media, some tools let you check the gender breakdown of the people you read . Make sure to identify those voices you\u2019ve ignored so far and listen to them. Along the same lines, ask to whom you are giving an audience. Make sure also to boost the messages of women instead of only focusing on your (male) buddies . Generally, the male overrepresentation in STEM means you\u2019re likely to default to male perspectives. Make sure to steer actively against this. \nThis becomes even more important in the context of organizing conferences, events or communities at large, as representation matters. Achieving a 50:50 gender split at conferences is still not a given and is the sad reason why #YAMMM (yet another mostly male meeting) and #manel are common hashtags on Twitter. Try to consult speaker databases that relate to your topic of interest (like the Open Speakers Database [10] for all things open). Additional ways to counteract gender-biased presenter lineups are listed in Ten Simple Rules to Achieve Conference Speaker Gender Balance . \nFurthermore, look at who is participating not only at your co-organized conferences, but also at your communities at large, be it a research project or a lab you are running. Do you end up having a homogenous, male participant base? This might be because the community\u2019s culture and behaviour are all but inviting for anyone else. Formulating well-stated, positive community values along with a code of conduct can help with a cultural change. The Diversity, Equity, Inclusion report of OpenCon offers excellent guidance and lessons learnt on these topics. Kirstie Whitaker gives a good example of a code of conduct for the lab . Lastly, you will need to enforce your code of conduct and reinforce good behavior in your communities, as only this will lead to lasting change. \nIf you are not the one setting the official rules for the communities you are involved with, you can still play your part in supporting women in STEM. Ask the organizers about their gender balance amongst the presenters and decline the invitation if it is a manel or YAMMM. Be explicit about your reason for declining [14] and ideally even offer them a list of women they should ask to present. In my experience this can often have a direct effect on who will speak at an event. \nYou can similarly push conference organizers and project leaders to adopt a code of conduct if they haven\u2019t done so already. And lastly, there is an opportunity for you to speak instead of listen: it is important that unacceptable behaviour should be called out by everyone, not only the targets of it, especially as men face fewer negative consequences than women for doing so . So, step in when you observe inappropriate behaviour as well as sexist jokes and assumptions. It is what Mikka McKinnon pointedly called Intervene when you see BS . Don\u2019t be quiet in these situations, but speak out and offer support. \nThis is by no means a complete list of things that men can and need to do to support women, inside and outside STEM. It does not magically solve all structural biases inherent in the current STEM environment. But I believe it makes for a good start for improving oneself, including me: take some steps back, listen to women who have all the unwanted experience in how STEM fails them, and learn how you can make a difference. Only then can you help the world of STEM to become a better place for all. \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Meyer on October 10, 2017 Share on Facebook For illustration purposes only. Credit: Josipa Basic Getty Images Advertisement \nTake a moment and picture an image of a rapist. Without a doubt, you are thinking about a man. Given our pervasive cultural understanding that perpetrators of sexual violence are nearly always men, this makes sense. But this assumption belies the reality, revealed in our study of large-scale federal agency surveys, that women are also often perpetrators of sexual victimization. \nIn 2014, we published a study on the sexual victimization of men, finding that men were much more likely to be victims of sexual abuse than was thought. To understand who was committing the abuse, we next analyzed four surveys conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to glean an overall picture of how frequently women were committing sexual victimization. \nThe results were surprising. For example, the CDC\u2019s nationally representative data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators. \nWe also pooled four years of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data and found that 35 percent of male victims who experienced rape or sexual assault reported at least one female perpetrator. Among those who were raped or sexually assaulted by a woman, 58 percent of male victims and 41 percent of female victims reported that the incident involved a violent attack, meaning the female perpetrator hit, knocked down or otherwise attacked the victim, many of whom reported injuries. \nAnd, because we had previously shown that nearly one million incidents of sexual victimization happen in our nation\u2019s prisons and jails each year, we knew that no analysis of sexual victimization in the U.S. would be complete without a look at sexual abuse happening behind bars . We found that, contrary to assumptions, the biggest threat to women serving time does not come from male corrections staff. Instead, female victims are more than three times as likely to experience sexual abuse by other women inmates than by male staff. \nAlso surprisingly, women inmates are more likely to be abused by other inmates than are male inmates, disrupting the long held view that sexual violence in prison is mainly about men assaulting men. In juvenile corrections facilities , female staff are also a much more significant threat than male staff; more than nine in ten juveniles who reported staff sexual victimization were abused by a woman. \nOur findings might be critically viewed as an effort to upend a women\u2019s rights agenda that focuses on the sexual threat posed by men. To the contrary, we argue that male-perpetrated sexual victimization remains a chronic problem, from the schoolyard to the White House. In fact, 96 percent of women who report rape or sexual assault in the NCVS were abused by men. In presenting our findings, we argue that a comprehensive look at sexual victimization, which includes male perpetration and adds female perpetration, is consistent with feminist principles in important ways. \nFor example, the common one-dimensional portrayal of women as harmless victims reinforces outdated gender stereotypes. This keeps us from seeing women as complex human beings, able to wield power, even in misguided or violent ways. And, the assumption that men are always perpetrators and never victims reinforces unhealthy ideas about men and their supposed invincibility. These hyper-masculine ideals can reinforce aggressive male attitudes and, at the same time, callously stereotype male victims of sexual abuse as \u201cfailed men.\u201d \nOther gender stereotypes prevent effective responses, such as the trope that men are sexually insatiable. Aware of the popular misconception that, for men, all sex is welcome, male victims often feel too embarrassed to report sexual victimization. If they do report it, they are frequently met with a response that assumes no real harm was done. \nWomen abused by other women are also an overlooked group; these victims discover that most services are designed for women victimized by men. Behind bars, we found that sexual minorities were 2-3 times more likely to be sexually victimized by staff members than straight inmates. This is particularly alarming as our related research found that sexual minorities, especially lesbian and bisexual women, are much more likely to be incarcerated to begin with. \nIn addition to the risk faced by sexual minorities, the U.S. disproportionately incarcerates people who are Black, Latino/a, low-income, or mentally ill, putting these populations at risk of abuse. Detained juveniles experience particularly high rates of sexual victimization, and young people outside of the system are also at risk. A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19. \nProfessionals in mental health, social work, public health, and criminal justice often downplay female perpetration. But in fact, victims of female-perpetrated sexual violence suffer emotional and psychological harm, just like victims of male-perpetrated abuse. And when professionals fail to take victimization by women seriously, this only compounds victims\u2019 suffering by minimizing the harm they experience. \nResearchers also find that female perpetrators have often been previously sexually victimized themselves. Women who commit sexual victimization are more likely to have an extensive history of sexual abuse, with more perpetrators and at earlier ages than those who commit other crimes. Some women commit sexual victimization alongside abusive male co-perpetrators. These patterns of gender-based violence must be understood in order to reach the troubled women who harm others. \nTo thoroughly dismantle sexual victimization, we must grapple with its many complexities, which requires attention to all victims and perpetrators, regardless of their sex. This inclusive framing need not and should not come at the expense of gender sensitive approaches, which take into account the ways in which gender norms influence women and men in different or disproportionate ways. \nMale-perpetrated sexual victimization finally came to public attention after centuries of denial and indifference, thanks to women\u2019s rights advocates and the anti-rape movement. Attention to sexual victimization perpetrated by women should be understood as a necessary next step in continuing and expanding upon this important legacy.

Credit: NurPhoto Getty Images Advertisement \nThe Trump administration today will officially announce the end of the Clean Power Plan, a regulation limiting planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. But the conservative crowd that's skeptical about climate change says its work is just beginning. \nU.S. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt argued yesterday that the climate rule is a reflection of President Obama's antagonism toward the fossil fuel industry, describing it as an unlawful interpretation of the Clean Air Act ( Greenwire , Oct. 9). \n\u201cThe past administration was unapologetic,\u201d Pruitt told a group of coal miners yesterday in Hazard, Ky. \u201cThey were using every bit of power, every bit of authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers in how we generate electricity in this country. And that's wrong.\u201d \nFor all the applause that Pruitt received, there is also disgruntlement. A backroom battle between industry officials and those anti-climate conservatives over whether to issue a scaled-back replacement rule is burgeoning. The hard-liners don't want an alternative rule because greenhouse gases would still be regulated. And that could mark an acceptance of the endangerment finding, a mound of scientific evidence that affirms human-caused carbon emissions are at the root of rising temperatures. \nClimate skeptics question if Pruitt truly wants to attack the endangerment finding. He hasn't said yes or no publicly. He's only offered hints. Doubts extend to President Trump, who has expressed cynicism about climate science but hasn't focused on the all-important finding. \nSome conservative skeptics doubt that Trump knows the limitations his anti-regulatory agenda faces if the endangerment finding continues to exist. The finding serves as the legal backbone for climate regulation, with many interpreting it as mandating federal action to curb greenhouse gas emissions. \n\u201cI don't think the president knows that it's not enough to issue executive orders. He might be disappointed to know those things are still there,\u201d said Steve Milloy, an attorney, EPA adversary and Trump EPA transition team official. \u201cIt's still early. But there's a lot of work left to be done. It's not enough to say get rid of this. You've actually got to do it.\u201d \nHere's a case in point: When speaking to a rally in Alabama late last month, Trump said of the Clean Power Plan, \u201cDid you see what I did to that? Boom, gone.\u201d It wasn't true. The rule was very much still intact, and powerful industry trade organizations, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), were simultaneously pushing White House officials to maintain a downsized version of that very rule ( Climatewire , Oct. 5). \n\u201cThe NAM supports a greenhouse gas policy going forward that is narrowly tailored and consistent with the Clean Air Act,\u201d Ross Eisenberg, NAM's vice president of energy and resources policy, said in a statement praising news of the repeal while pushing for a replacement. \nThat industry groups have the White House's ear reflects a shift in some of the administration's broader political sensibilities. \nClimate skeptics lament the loss of their brother in arms, former chief strategist Steve Bannon, and his influence on pressing Trump to go full bore on climate matters. In his place, moderate voices like Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, economic adviser Gary Cohn and Chief of Staff John Kelly have gradually tried to steer the White House away from the nationalistic tenor during Trump's earliest days in office. \n\u201cThe worrisome news for climate skeptics is that Bannon is gone,\u201d Marc Morano, a former staffer for Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and a prominent climate skeptic, said in an email. \u201cIt appears that Gary Cohn is trying to fill the vacuum on climate policy and that is not a good development for skeptics. Hopefully Pruitt and [Energy Secretary Rick] Perry will pick up the slack and keep the administration on the path to dismantling Obama's climate 'legacy.'\u201d \nAt times, that's meant some confusing messaging on a variety of climate-related aims. The Clean Power Plan is one thing. EPA also hasn't appeared to move on a plan to challenge climate science through a \u201cred team, blue team\u201d debate. And on the Paris climate accord, administration officials now speak of a chance for \u201cre-engagement,\u201d even though Trump announced in June that the United States would withdraw from the deal ( Greenwire , Sept. 18). \n\u201cI wish President Trump would order officials within the administration to stop hinting that this could change,\u201d Myron Ebell, who led Trump's EPA transition, said in an email. \u201cI think many people in other countries are taking these hints seriously.\u201d \nThe endangerment finding, though, is conservative climate skeptics' main target. The White House's skittishness in embracing that fight is a source of consternation for many of them. Some of them served on transition teams at EPA and the Energy and Interior departments with explicit goals of setting the groundwork for that challenge. \nIndustry groups and establishment-leaning Republicans want to avoid a foray to undermine the finding. Success is far-fetched and a distraction, they argue, potentially painting Republicans as evermore extreme on climate. And it's a major gamble. \nClimate scientists say it would be difficult, if not impossible, to overturn the finding because its critics would need to amass scientific evidence that says exactly the opposite of what the science indicates: Humans are increasingly responsible for warming the planet. Those findings have grown since EPA issued the endangerment finding in 2009. \n\u201cWorth remembering, @EPA is *required* to regulate CO2 emissions from power plants because of the (rock solid) CO2 endangerment finding,\u201d tweeted Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. \nThe vocal minority of climate skeptics contend that axing the finding is key to ensuring that deregulatory efforts remain in place. Federal courts have already rejected a number of the White House's environmental actions, a theme that could repeat itself on climate matters. \n\u201cAs long as the Endangerment Finding is in place, I fear that there is going to have to be some limited regulation of greenhouse gas emissions at least,\u201d Ebell said. \u201cAs long as the Endangerment Finding is in place, a future administration could quickly move to promulgate new regulations along the lines of the\u201d Clean Power Plan. \nClimate skeptics are trying to be patient, but they worry that Trump, a political newcomer, doesn't fully appreciate the time and effort it would take to upend the endangerment finding. As an example, they point to the limited staff at EPA, which is a function of the slow pace of tendering and approving political nominees. \nSo skeptics are trying to advocate from the outside until there's enough political appointees to do the heavy lifting needed for a challenge to the endangerment finding. \n\u201cWhat I hear from folks really in the know is they expect it to be gone,\u201d Heartland Institute President Tim Huelskamp said of whether the Trump administration plans to try to undo the endangerment finding. \u201cAt the end of the day, I'm still trying to find a serious scientist that thinks CO2 is a pollutant.\u201d \nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&E News.

Lying proved a very successful strategy for political causes and individual candidates in the U.K. and U.S. elections in 2016, leading Oxford Dictionaries to choose \u201cpost-truth\u201d as its 2016 word of the year. As such, it might seem ludicrous to many that we can solve the problem of lies in politics. Research in behavioral science suggests, however, that we can address political deception through a number of effective strategies, which are brought together in the Pro-Truth Pledge project. \nBut first, we need to identify why current mechanisms of preventing political deception don\u2019t work well. The traditional mechanisms for identifying the truth about politics come from mainstream media and its fact checking. Polling shows , however, that trust in the mainstream media has dropped from around 50 to 32 percent from 2000 to 2016, and only 29 percent trust fact checking. No wonder fewer and fewer Americans are getting their news from mainstream media and engaging with fact checkers. \nAt the same time increasing numbers of people are using social media to get news\u201462 percent, according to studies . Unfortunately, a study by Stanford University shows that most social media news consumers cannot differentiate real from fake news stories. The situation is so bad that, according to research , in the three months before the presidential election the top 20 false news stories had more Facebook shares, reactions and comments than did the top 20 true news articles. \nGiven the crumbling trust in traditional media and our vulnerability to lies on social media, we should not be surprised that politicians on both sides try to manipulate voters into believing lies. After all, the incentive for politicians is to get elected, not tell the truth. To be elected, politicians need to convey the appearance of trustworthiness\u2014what talk show host Stephen Colbert infamously called \u201c truthiness \u201d\u2014as opposed to being actually trustworthy. If politicians can safely ignore fact checking by traditional news media and instead use social media to get their followers to believe their claims, the scale is tilted toward post-truth politics. \nIn the long run, this tendency leads to high political polarization and the deterioration of trust in the political system. In modern history, in states such as Russia, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Turkey and Italy, post-truth politics has led to the rise of authoritarian and corrupt regimes. We must do all we can to prevent this outcome in the U.S. \nTilting the scale toward truth requires a two-pronged approach, one targeting both private citizens and public figures. Research shows that without any intervention people tend to ignore information that goes against their beliefs, and are more likely to deceive both when they see others do so and when it benefits their in-group. However, increased risk of suffering negative consequences, being reminded about ethics, publicity about and committing in advance to honesty all decrease the incentive to lie for ordinary citizens. For public figures, research suggests that transparent, clear information about who is truthful, coupled with reputational rewards for socially beneficial behavior such as honesty and enforced with penalties for dishonesty are the most vital interventions. \nTo solve the problem of systemic lying, a group of behavioral scientists, along with many concerned citizens have launched the Pro-Truth Pledge. This asks all signees to commit to a set of truth-oriented behaviors. Whenever they share a news article, signees are encouraged to add a sentence stating they took the Pledge and verify that they fact checked the article, which serves to remind people of their ethical commitment. \nPledge takers are encouraged to share publicly with their networks about taking the Pledge, asking others to hold them accountable\u2014thus deliberately increasing the risk of negative consequences of sharing fake news. Likewise, the Pledge asks signees to hold others accountable, requesting those who share fake news to retract it. Further reinforcing all the above, Pledge takers can get monthly newsletters, follow the Pledge\u2019s Twitter and Facebook accounts, join a community of fellow Pledge takers online or in person, get truth-oriented resources and volunteer to help with the Pledge. \nPublic figures\u2014politicians, journalists, media figures, CEOs, academics, ministers, speakers and others\u2014get additional benefits, in line with the research. They have the opportunity to share a paragraph about why they took the Pledge and provide links to their online presence. The paragraph is then sent around in the Pledge newsletter and posted on social media, as a way of providing a reputational reward for committing to truth-oriented behavior. Public figures also get their public information listed in a database on Pro-Truth Pledge and can post a badge on their own Web sites about their commitment to the Pledge, providing clarity to all about which public figures are committed to truthful behavior. \nThese rewards for public figures will grow more substantial as the Pledge becomes more popular and well known, creating a virtuous cycle. The more private citizens and public figures sign the Pledge and the more credibility it gets, the more incentives other public figures will have to sign it. Whereas these early adopters will be most committed to honesty, behavioral science suggests that later adopters will be more likely to do so out of a desire to gain a reputation as honest, and thus will be more likely to cheat. \nTo address this problem, the Pledge crowdsources the fight against lies. One of the volunteer roles for the Pledge is monitoring public figure signees. If a volunteer suspects a public figure has made a false statement, the volunteer would approach the person privately and ask for clarification. The matter can be resolved by the public figure issuing a retraction\u2014everyone makes mistakes\u2014or the volunteer realizing the public figure\u2019s statement is not false. If the matter is not resolved, the volunteer would then submit the case to a mediating committee of vetted and trained Pro-Truth Pledge volunteers. They would investigate the matter and give the public figure an opportunity to issue a retraction or explain why the statement is true. \nIf the public figure refuses to do so, the mediating committee then assumes that the public figure lied\u2014meaning a deliberately false statement was made, and rules the person in contempt of the Pledge. This ruling triggers a substantial reputational punishment. The mediating committee issues a media advisory to all relevant media venues that the public figure is in contempt of the Pledge and puts that information on the Pledge Web site. The committee also sends an action alert to all Pledge takers who are constituents to that public figure, asking them to tweet, post, text, call, write, meet with and otherwise lobby the public figure to retract their statement. A public figure who intends to lie is much better off not taking the Pledge at all. \nWill the Pledge work to tilt the scale toward truth? In order to tell, we\u2019ll need to evaluate whether and why people are taking the Pledge and also whether the Pledge changes their behavior. \nRolled out in late March, the Pledge has over 1,000 signees so far and has already had some positive mainstream media coverage . The Pledge takers include a number of politicians , talk show hosts , academics and public commentators who expressed strong enthusiasm for the project. \nWhat about behavioral change? A retired U.S. intelligence officer described how he saw an article \u201cthat played right to [his] particular political biases\u201d and his \u201cfirst inclination was to share it as quickly and widely as possible. But then [he] remembered the Pledge [he\u2019d] signed and put the brakes on.\u201d The story turned out to be false, and \u201cthat experience has led [him] to be much more vigilant in assessing and sharing stories that appeal to [his] political sensibilities.\u201d \nMichael Smith, a candidate for Congress in Idaho, took the Pledge, and later posted on his Facebook wall a screen shot of a tweet by Donald Trump criticizing minority and disabled children. After being called out on it, he went and searched Trump\u2019s feed. He could not find the original tweet, and although Trump may have deleted it, the candidate edited his own Facebook post to say, \u201cDue to a Truth Pledge I have taken, I have to say I have not been able to verify this post.\u201d He indicated that he would be more careful with future postings. \nThe evidence so far shows that the Pro-Truth Pledge has the potential to protect our democracy from the tide of lies. Whether it will succeed depends on how many people go to the Web site sign the Pledge, spread the word, lobby public figures to sign it and monitor those who do. The early results look promising. \nThe views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

The therapy, Luxturna, or voretigene neparvovec, would be the first-ever gene therapy for any inherited disease to be approved in the United States. \nThe FDA\u2019s review, posted on Tuesday on the agency\u2019s website, comes two days ahead of a meeting of outside advisers who will discuss the treatment and recommend whether it should be approved. Michael Yee, an analyst at Jefferies, said the FDA documents \u201clook fairly benign and as expected,\u201d and said he expects the advisory panel is likely to vote in favor of approval. The FDA noted there is no available long-term data to show whether the effectiveness of the therapy is maintained after a year, so the clinical benefit beyond that \u201cis unclear.\u201d Inherited retinal diseases are a group of rare conditions caused by mutations in one or more than 220 different genes, including one known as RPE65, which tells cells how to produce a crucial enzyme needed for normal vision. Spark studied Luxturna in people with one of these conditions, Leber congenital aumaurosis, whose disease was mediated by defects in the RPE65 gene. \nClinical trial results showed 93 percent of participants experienced some improvement in their functional vision as measured by their ability to navigate obstacles in poor light. \nIn January the FDA granted the company\u2019s request to alter the drug\u2019s proposed patient population to include any person with an inherited retinal disease due to a biallelic RPE65 mutation, meaning that the mutation is found in both copies of the gene.

Conventional wisdom has always put it at every 3,000 miles to prevent engine wear, but isn\u2019t changing oil that frequently wasteful and unnecessary? Also, what is the \"greenest\" and longest-lasting oil I should use? -- Vic Roberts, Lincoln, MA \nThere is much debate in the automotive world over how often drivers of typical passenger cars or light trucks should change their oil . The quick-lube chains usually recommend it be done every three months or 3,000 miles, but many mechanics would tell you that such frequent changes are overkill. Indeed, most car owner\u2019s manuals recommend changing out the oil less frequently, usually after 5,000 or 7,500 miles. \nAccording to the automotive website Edmunds.com, the answer depends more on driving patterns than anything else. Those who rarely drive more than 10 miles at a time (which doesn\u2019t get the oil hot enough to boil off moisture condensation) or who start their car frequently when the oil isn\u2019t hot (when most engine wear occurs) should change their oil more often\u2014at least twice a year, even if that\u2019s every 1,000 miles, according to Edmunds. But commuters who drive more than 20 miles a day on mostly flat freeway can go as far as their owner\u2019s manual recommends, if not longer, between changes. As a car ages, more frequent changes might be in order, but that\u2019s for a qualified mechanic to decide on a case-by-case basis. \n\u201cThe necessity of 3,000 mile oil changes is a myth that has been handed down for decades,\u201d writes Austin Davis, proprietor of the website TrustMyMechanic.com. He says that the economics of the oil change industry demand pushing customers to get their oil changed more frequently\u2014purportedly as \u201ccheap insurance\u201d against problems cropping up\u2014whether they need it or not. One of the largest oil change chains, Jiffy Lube, for instance, is owned by Pennzoil-Quaker State, and as such has an incentive to sell as much of the company\u2019s traditional petroleum-based oil as possible. \nOne way to reduce trips to and money spent unnecessarily on quick-lube outlets is to switch to synthetic oils, which last longer and perform better than their traditional petroleum-based counterparts. Davis says that educated drivers should opt for longer lasting, better performing synthetic oils, which are \u201cmost likely good for 10,000 to 15,000 miles or six months\u201d whether or not their manufacturers recommend more frequent changes or not. Some synthetic motor oils, like Amsoil, NEO and Red Line, to name a few, are created specifically to last 25,000 miles or one year before needing a change. \nWhile neither conventional nor synthetic motor oils are good for the environment if disposed of improperly or spilled , most environmentalists would opt for the latter since it lasts three or more times longer and thus reduces waste (or energy use if recycled). Researchers have been experimenting with producing greener motor oils\u2014one pilot project out of Purdue University has produced high-quality, carbon-neutral motor oil from canola crops\u2014but consumers should not expect to see such products on store or garage shelves anytime soon, as the costs of production are high and the availability of cropland is limited. But the very existence of such alternatives\u2014no doubt more are in the offing\u2014bodes well for the future as oil becomes more scarce and expensive. \nCONTACTS : Edmunds.com, www.edmunds.com ; TrustMyMechanic.com, www.trustmymechanic.com . \nGOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTION?

Credit: Josh Edelson Getty Images Advertisement SANTA ROSA, Calif. (Reuters) - Firefighters battling 15 wildfires that have killed at least 11 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in California\u2019s wine country on welcomed a drop in winds and an expected layer of cool, moist fog rolling in on Tuesday. Officials said about 1,500 homes and commercial buildings had been destroyed as tens of thousands of acres had gone up in flames since the weekend. Videos and pictures circulated online showed pockets of devastation, including an entire residential neighborhood reduced to ashes, a Hilton hotel ablaze and an inferno that was previously a supermarket. The fires were fanned by high temperatures and dry conditions, displacing some 20,000 residents, robbing others of power and forcing schools and at least two hospitals in Sonoma County to close. \nSteve Crawford, an operations chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said at a briefing for law enforcement and utility officials on Tuesday morning that a change in the weather could help firefighters. \u201cWe need to jump on it and take advantage of this lull before any other wind jumps up,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of devastation out there, people running around who just lost everything. Keep that in mind. Maybe we\u2019re used to seeing fire and destruction but these people aren\u2018t.\u201d \nIn the wine country north of San Francisco, Sonoma County bore the brunt of the fatalities, with the sheriff\u2019s department confirming seven fire-related deaths. Two people died in Napa County and one in Mendocino County, officials said. An 11th death was reported in Yuba County, NBC News reported. More than 100 people had been treated for fire-related injuries, including burns and smoke inhalation, CNN reported. The status of the grape crop currently being harvested in Napa and Sonoma, where the largest fires burned, was unclear. \nIn addition to potential damage to vineyards from fire itself, experts say sustained exposure to heavy smoke can taint unpicked grapes. Fred Oliai, 47, owner of the Alta Napa Valley Winery, said winemakers were nervous. \u201cYou can\u2019t see anything,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe smoke is very dense.\u201d Oliai had not been able to get close enough to his vineyards to see if flames reached his 90-acre property. \u201cWe got our grapes in last week but others still have grapes hanging,\u201d he said. California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in Napa, Sonoma and five other counties. \nThat included Orange County in Southern California, where a wildfire on Monday destroyed at least a half dozen homes in the affluent Anaheim Hills neighborhood, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents, authorities said. \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved grants to help cover the cost of fighting 10 fires across the state, it said on Tuesday, without specifying the amounts.
