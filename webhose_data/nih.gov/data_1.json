Due to the exceptional impact of this storm, we want to assure our grantee community that NIH will be doing our part to help you continue your research. Our website on Extramural Response to Natural Disasters has a list of available resources, including guidance on animal welfare issues. \nAlthough NIH's general policy is to accept applications submitted late due to a natural disaster by no more than the number of days applicant organization was officially closed, NIH deems it extremely necessary to provide additional exceptions and guidance are being provided due to the catastrophic damage caused by Maria. Specific policy exceptions are detailed below. \nLate application submission NIH will make an exception to the general policy mentioned above ( NIHGPS Chapter 2.3.9 ) for institutions in the Maria-affected areas in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. NIH will accept late applications for Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) with due dates from September 16, 2017 to December 16, 2017, from institutions in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. \nThis exception supersedes language in FOAs that have due dates in that time frame, which specifies that late applications will not be accepted. Applications from institutions in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico must be submitted no later than 11:59 pm (local applicant organization time) on December 16, 2017. \nIn the rare circumstance that an application due date and one-time meeting for review of those applications both fall within the date range noted above, it may be possible for applications to be reviewed if received no later than three weeks before the review meeting. However, the applicant must contact the Scientific Review Officer managing that meeting to confirm the meetings schedule, since the date may have changed. \nA one-page cover letter explaining the reason for delay can be submitted, but is not required. Late applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. \nNote: An institution in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico can still apply to an FOA that has expired. The applicant institution should contact the eRA service desk at least 2 business days prior to your anticipated submission so they can coordinate any changes needed to allow systems to process your application. \nPost-submission Materials Institutions in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico may submit post-submission grant application materials to revise information that was submitted in an application for a due date before September 16, 2017, or in an application submitted under this Notice\u2019s exception. Post-submission materials will be accepted from institutions in the affected areas until fourteen days before the start of the review meeting. See \u201c Frequently Asked Questions ; Post-Submission Materials Policy\u201d for details of the NIH post-submission materials policy. A letter of explanation (maximum of one page) is required. \nSalary Payments NIH understands that many researchers were unable to work during and as a result of the storm, and this unproductive time may last weeks or even months. NIH reminds institutions that expenditure of award funds to continue paying salaries and fringe benefits to researchers during any period when no work is performed under the award is unallowable. However, such salary expenses may be allowable and charged when emergency funding is available to assist in disaster recovery related to the award, as detailed in the terms and conditions of award. \nPost-award Reporting Per NIH Grants Policy Statement sections 8.4.1 and 8.6 , as well as the Notice of Award, NIH requires that recipients periodically submit financial and progress reports. NIH understands that some reporting delays due to the storm are unavoidable. Therefore, if recipients are unable to complete and submit a progress report ((Research Performance Progress Reports (RPPR)), Financial reports (Federal Financial Report expenditure data), and/or invention report by the scheduled due date, they should promptly contact the assigned grants management and/or program official. Although NIH will accept these late reports, grant awards will be delayed until the required reports are submitted and accepted by NIH. \nPlease see the Recent Natural Disaster Events FAQs for additional guidance. \nNIH is continuing to monitor the situation closely, identifying ways we can help as outlined on this page , and will publish any additional information pertaining to Hurricane Maria response in the NIH Guide.

A brain drainage system - Brain scans of healthy volunteers showed that our brains may drain waste through lymphatic vessels, the body\u2019s sewer system. Reich Lab, NIH/NINDS. \nBy scanning the brains of healthy volunteers, researchers at the National Institutes of Health saw the first, long-sought evidence that our brains may drain some waste out through lymphatic vessels, the body\u2019s sewer system. The results further suggest the vessels could act as a pipeline between the brain and the immune system. \n\u201cWe literally watched people\u2019s brains drain fluid into these vessels,\u201d said Daniel S. Reich, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator at the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the senior author of the study published online in eLife . \u201cWe hope that our results provide new insights to a variety of neurological disorders.\u201d \nDr. Reich is a radiologist and neurologist who primarily uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders which are thought to involve the immune system. Led by post-doctoral fellows, Martina Absinta, Ph.D. and Seung-Kwon Ha, Ph.D., along with researchers from the National Cancer Institute, the team discovered lymphatic vessels in the dura, the leathery outer coating of the brain. \nLymphatic vessels are part of the body\u2019s circulatory system. In most of the body they run alongside blood vessels. They transport lymph, a colorless fluid containing immune cells and waste, to the lymph nodes. Blood vessels deliver white blood cells to an organ and the lymphatic system removes the cells and recirculates them through the body. The process helps the immune system detect whether an organ is under attack from bacteria or viruses or has been injured. \nIn 1816, an Italian anatomist reported finding lymphatic vessels on the surface of the brain, but for two centuries, it was forgotten. Until very recently, researchers in the modern era found no evidence of a lymphatic system in the brain, leaving some puzzled about how the brain drains waste, and others to conclude that brain is an exceptional organ. Then in 2015, two studies of mice found evidence of the brain\u2019s lymphatic system in the dura. Coincidentally, that year, Dr. Reich saw a presentation by Jonathan Kipnis, Ph.D., a professor at the University of Virginia and an author of one the mouse studies. \n\u201cI was completely surprised. In medical school, we were taught that the brain has no lymphatic system,\u201d said Dr. Reich. \u201cAfter Dr. Kipnis\u2019 talk, I thought, maybe we could find it in human brains?\u201d \nTo look for the vessels, Dr. Reich\u2019s team used MRI to scan the brains of five healthy volunteers who had been injected with gadobutrol, a magnetic dye typically used to visualize brain blood vessels damaged by diseases, such as multiple sclerosis or cancer. The dye molecules are small enough to leak out of blood vessels in the dura but too big to pass through the blood-brain barrier and enter other parts of the brain. \nAt first, when the researchers set the MRI to see blood vessels, the dura lit up brightly, and they could not see any signs of the lymphatic system. But, when they tuned the scanner differently, the blood vessels disappeared, and the researchers saw that dura also contained smaller but almost equally bright spots and lines which they suspected were lymph vessels. The results suggested that the dye leaked out of the blood vessels, flowed through the dura and into neighboring lymphatic vessels. \nTo test this idea, the researchers performed another round of scans on two subjects after first injecting them with a second dye made up of larger molecules that leak much less out of blood vessels. In contrast with the first round of scans, the researchers saw blood vessels in the dura but no lymph vessels regardless of how they tuned the scanner, confirming their suspicions. \nThey also found evidence for blood and lymph vessels in the dura of autopsied human brain tissue. Moreover, their brain scans and autopsy studies of brains from nonhuman primates confirmed the results seen in humans, suggesting the lymphatic system is a common feature of mammalian brains. \n\u201cThese results could fundamentally change the way we think about how the brain and immune system inter-relate,\u201d said Walter J. Koroshetz, M.D., NINDS director. \nDr. Reich\u2019s team plans to investigate whether the lymphatic system works differently in patients who have multiple sclerosis or other neuroinflammatory disorders. \n\u201cFor years we knew how fluid entered the brain. Now we may finally see that, like other organs in the body, brain fluid can drain out through the lymphatic system,\u201d said Dr. Reich. \nThis study was supported by the Intramural Research Programs at the NINDS and the National Cancer Institute, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. \nNINDS is the nation\u2019s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. \nAbout the National Cancer Institute (NCI): NCI leads the National Cancer Program and NIH\u2019s efforts to dramatically reduce the prevalence of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, through research into prevention and cancer biology, the development of new interventions, and the training and mentoring of new researchers.

Dual independent mapping by trained terminology specialists is employed to assure quality and reduce variability. Identical maps created independently are accepted as final, while discordant maps are reviewed by a third expert. Regular team meetings are held to discuss problematic and ambiguous cases. Rule-based Mapping \nDue to the differences in granularity, emphasis and organizing principles between SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM, it is not always possible to have a one-to-one map between a SNOMED CT concept and an ICD-10-CM code. To address this challenge, this Map follows an approach that is consistent with the approach used by the IHTSDO and WHO in the construction of the SNOMED CT to ICD-10 rule-based map. When there is a need to choose between alternative ICD-10-CM codes, each possible target code is represented as a \u201cmap rule\u201d (the essence of \"rule-based mapping\"). Related map rules are grouped into a \"map group\". Map rules within a map group are evaluated in a prescribed order at run-time, based on contextual information and co-morbidities. Each map group will resolve to at most one ICD-10-CM code. In the event that a SNOMED CT concept requires more than one ICD-10-CM code to fully represent its meaning, the map will consist of multiple map groups. Scope \nAll current pre-coordinated SNOMED CT concepts within three hierarchies,(Clinical findings, Events, and Situations with Explicit Context) are potentially in scope for mapping to ICD-10-CM. A priority list of clinically important concepts was identified based on the CORE Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT , which includes frequently seen problems, and the Convergent Medical Terminology contents donated by Kaiser Permanente. All concepts in the US Extension that are within the mapping scope are mapped. Expansion of coverage of the map to other SNOMED CT concepts will depend on user feedback and availability of resources. Release Schedule \nThe Map will be periodically updated to increase SNOMED CT coverage and to synchronize with new releases of the two terminologies. File Format \nThe Map is published primarily as four refsets in the SNOMED CT Release Format 2 (RF2) format . To support easy browsing and understanding of the Map, it is also published as a tab delimited file that can be opened as a spreadsheet. This is a \u201creadable\u201d version of the Map that can be understood by a non-technical individual. License Requirements \nIn accordance with NLM\u2019s mapping assumptions , the Map can be used by users that are licensed to use both SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM. SNOMED CT is owned by the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO). The NLM is the U.S. Member of the IHTSDO and, as such, distributes SNOMED CT at no cost in accordance with the Member rights and responsibilities outlined in the IHTSDO's Articles.

Credit: Thinkstock/jarun011 \nEvery year, thousands of older Americans require emergency treatment to stop bleeding caused by taking warfarin, a frequently prescribed blood-thinning pill. My own mother received this drug in her later years, and her doctors encountered significant challenges getting the dose right. The problem is too much warfarin causes potentially serious bleeding, while too little leaves those who need the drug vulnerable to developing life-threatening clots in their legs or heart. The difference between too little and too much is distressingly small. But what if before writing a prescription, doctors could test for known genetic markers to help them gauge the amount of warfarin that a person should take? \nSuch tests have been available to doctors and patients for a few years, but they have not been widely used. The recent results of a national clinical trial offer some of the most convincing evidence that it\u2019s time for that to change. In this study of 1,650 older adults undergoing elective hip or knee surgery, patients whose genetic makeup was used to help determine their dose of warfarin were less likely to suffer adverse events, including major bleeding. This trial marks an encouraging success story for the emerging field of pharmacogenomics, the study of how the variations in our genes affect our responses to medicines. \nMost drugs are now prescribed in a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d fashion\u2014as though they should work the same way in all people. But they don\u2019t. Differences in our genes, sex, age, physiology, diet, and environment affect how our bodies respond to drugs. \nThat\u2019s certainly the case with warfarin. With growing evidence that specific gene variations could affect benefits and risks, the Food and Drug Administration revised its product label in 2007 to encourage doctors to order pharmacogenomic tests when prescribing it. The suggestion, however, has gone largely unheeded. Prior studies hadn\u2019t conclusively demonstrated that adjusting dosage on the basis of pharmacogenomic testing prevented adverse events among patients starting warfarin, and obtaining gene test results might take days or weeks\u2014so doctors justifiably wondered whether this fine tuning of warfarin dosage was really necessary [1]. \nThat\u2019s what makes the results of the latest clinical trial, published recently in JAMA, so interesting [2]. They come from the NIH-supported Genetic InFormatics Trial (GIFT) of Warfarin Therapy to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis, led by Brian F. Gage at Washington University, St. Louis. \nUnlike the previous clinical studies, GIFT enrolled more participants to detect possible differences. The trial also tested for variants in three genes instead of two, and used the genetic results to guide warfarin dosing for a longer period of 11 days. These gene variants include: CYP4F2, involved in the metabolism of vitamin K to help clot blood; CYP2C9 and its influence on warfarin metabolism in the liver; and VKORC1, involved in warfarin sensitivity. \nIn the study, Gage and colleagues enrolled healthy older adults (average age 72 and 64 percent women) planning to undergo elective hip or knee surgery. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Those in one group were dosed according to clinical factors, such as age, height, and weight. The other participants arrived at a dose based on those same clinical factors, plus testing of the gene variants. \nOf the 789 patients prescribed warfarin based on clinical factors alone, 116 (14.7 percent) had at least one adverse event: major bleeding, a warfarin overdose, or a blood clot. But of the 808 patients who also received pharmacogenomic testing, only 87 (10.8 percent) had an adverse event. Indeed, pharmacogenomic dosing led to a reduction in the number of bleeding events, from 74 to 57. It nearly halved the number of symptomatic adverse events overall. \nWhile the findings are encouraging, their immediate impact will depend, in part, on whether insurance companies decide to cover the cost of testing for these genes, which is nearly $200 today, but may decrease in the future. Meanwhile, efforts like the NIH All Of Us Research Program\u2014which will soon enroll 1 million Americans to improve health and health care\u2014offer the chance to further explore the use of pharmacogenomic testing and potentially to expand its use to many drugs. \nAs the evidence builds and genetic testing becomes less expensive, some may choose to undergo pharmacogenomic testing before they get sick or need surgery. Gage says he hopes to integrate genetic information into patients\u2019 electronic medical records so that it\u2019s available anytime a new drug is prescribed. The goal is fewer adverse reactions to medicines, for older Americans and younger ones, too. \nReferences: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian f. gage", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nih", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nih all of us research program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nih-supported genetic informatics trial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:50:15.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "026bb5470473deb6ff9465aa5b779e834a47a7e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSKs_4LP1M6tQM8kQq3f6kR5D27W_xKBe2hO4UPYFS3yHN.zCyYyy89IHGFB7imLLRJvOUGt68ynLtqBG9KIqRyIc8pqbylqit2kRAVcyKifg--", "site_full": "ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov", "site": "nih.gov", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "", "title": "PubMed Labs is now part of NCBI Labs | NCBI Insights", "title_full": "PubMed Labs is now part of NCBI Labs | NCBI Insights", "published": "2017-10-03T21:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "https://ncbiinsights.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/ncbi_logo.png?w=90", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 53, "comments": 0, "shares": 53}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 18}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "026bb5470473deb6ff9465aa5b779e834a47a7e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSKs_4LP1M6tQM8kQq3f6kR5D27W_xKBe2hO4UPYFS3yHN.zCyYyy89IHGFB7imLLRJvOUGt68ynLtqBG9KIqRyIc8pqbylqit2kRAVcyKifg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ncbi Staff", "published": "2017-10-03T21:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "PubMed Labs is now part of NCBI Labs | NCBI Insights", "text": "PubMed Labs is now part of NCBI Labs Posted on by NCBI Staff \nAbout two years ago, NCBI launched PubMed Labs , a gathering place for discovering and experimenting with new features and content for NCBI\u2019s family of websites .

The authors of the study propose a new method to address this issue. \n\u201cIf you think your exposure might act differently on the outcome by sex, you should think about confounders that might also act differently by sex, and account for that,\u201d says Jessie Buckley, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who coauthored the new study. \nResearchers typically use one of two approaches     exposures and outcomes differ by sex. The first is stratification, where sex-specific associations are estimated using separate models for males and for females. The second uses a single model with an exposure-by-sex \u201cproduct term\u201d that allows the estimated associations to differ between males and females. Boys and girls can respond in different, sex-specific ways to certain environmental exposures. A new method for analyzing study data may help researchers identify these sex-specific responses more accurately. Image: \u00a9 monkeybusinessimages/iStockphoto. \nBoth approaches are often assumed to yield estimates that are essentially equivalent. However, this is not always the case given that the product term model does not accommodate sex-related confounding. 3 \nIn the new study, the authors proposed an augmented product term approach. The alternative model allows   to vary between girls and boys. What is unusual is that it also allows confounders\u2014that is, factors that are associated with the exposure of interest, and are also a separate cause or predictor of the outcome\u2014to differ by sex. \nTo test whether the alternative model produced more accurate estimates than traditional methods, the researchers simulated data from a simple hypothetical EDC study and created a variety of scenarios in which confounding factors, as well as effects of the EDC exposure, differed for girls versus boys. Then they used each of the three models to estimate sex-specific   the hypothetical exposure and health outcome. \nBecause the authors used simulated data for this analysis, they could compare the sex-specific estimates from each model with the \u201ctrue\u201d   that they had determined when they generated the data for the different scenarios. These comparisons showed that the stratified and augmented product term models produced accurate estimates of sex-specific effects in almost all cases, whereas the traditional product term model performed worse in five of the eight scenarios. 3 \nNext, the researchers applied the models to data from an earlier study they had conducted on prenatal phthalate exposure in boys and girls. 4 They found that estimates from the traditional product term model (which\u2014remember\u2014does not allow sex-specific confounding) differed from those generated using the stratified and augmented product term models. 3 \n\u201cThe different methods do produce slightly different answers, both in the simulated data and in the real-world data, but they are subtle differences,\u201d says Joseph Braun, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Brown University who was not involved with the study. However, he also indicates that such differences are important to note. \u201cWhen taken in concert with all of the other things that you are not accounting for, like selection bias, you may be missing things or getting the wrong answer,\u201d he says. \nThe study authors recommend that future EDC studies consider whether a confounder might have a sex-specific impact on the outcome of interest and incorporate the augmented product term approach in statistical analysis to reduce the risk of inaccurate conclusions. \u201cWe just wanted to make sure that people knew the assumption of the models that they are running,\u201d says Buckley. \u201cThe two approaches that people use are not equivalent when the confounders have different effects on the outcome based on sex.\u201d \nDrawing attention to this lack of equivalency is a particular strength of the study, in Braun\u2019s opinion. \u201cThis is the first study that I am aware of that has taken the steps to actually compare the two standard methods that everyone uses to examine effect measure modification,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is a real advancement in the state of science in that it gives us information about whether or not some of the methods we might be using are biased.\u201d \nJulia R.

As was the case for associations with prenatal p,p \u2032-DDE exposure, ORs for estimated postnatal p,p \u2032-DDE exposure and abnormal total difficulties and emotional scores were also positive for Ukraine and null for Greenland, whereas ORs for abnormal prosocial scores were positive for Greenland and null for Ukraine. \nWhen including both PCB-153 and p,p \u2032-DDE in the models, the confidence intervals were wider and the overall associations with PCB-153 were attenuated, whereas the p,p \u2032-DDE associations were enhanced in some cases, thus making it difficult   differences were simply the result of reduced precision, confounding by coexposure to each pollutant, or both (see Table S2). \nWe performed secondary analyses that adjusted for parity, maternal educational level, breastfeeding duration, gestational age at blood draw, and gestational age at birth. Including these covariates only changed the estimates marginally, and none of these covariates changed the significance level of the studied associations (data not shown). \nPrimary models of   prenatal exposures and behavioral outcomes were not adjusted for breastfeeding duration, which might act as an intermediate between prenatal exposures (maternal serum levels) and the outcomes by influencing postnatal exposures. Estimates from models of prenatal exposures that were additionally adjusted for breastfeeding duration (0, <6\u2009months, 6\u201312 months, >12\u2009months) were similar to those from the main analysis for the Ukraine cohort, whereas in the Greenland cohort, ORs were slightly attenuated toward the null (see Table S3). This result might reflect cohort-specific mediation by breastfeeding, but it might also be related to missing data for breastfeeding duration, which eliminated 40 observations for Greenland, but only 3 observations for Ukraine, from the adjusted complete-case analysis models. In the sensitivity analysis using the top 10th percentile of the SDQ scores as the abnormal group, the overall pattern of the results did not change (see Table S4). In addition, including the excluded participants from Poland in the pooled analysis did not change the results (see Table S5). Discussion \nWe found a consistent association between a doubling of prenatal exposure to p,p \u2032-DDE and increased odds of conduct problems in Greenland and Ukraine as well as in the pooled analysis. In addition, postnatal p,p \u2032-DDE exposure was associated with conduct problems in the pooled analysis. Prenatal and postnatal p,p \u2032-DDE exposures were positively associated with abnormal hyperactivity scores in both cohorts (significant for the pooled prenatal exposure OR), as well as with abnormal peer relationship scores (significant for the pooled postnatal exposure OR). In addition, we estimated nonsignificant positive associations with abnormal conduct scores in both cohorts for prenatal and postnatal PCB-153 exposures. The associations with total difficulties scores were not significant. \nOur findings suggest that prenatal and postnatal exposures to p,p \u2032-DDE and potentially prenatal expsure to PCB-153 may increase the risk or prevalence of conduct problems and abnormal hyperactivity in children 5 to 9 y of age. These findings add to the growing body of evidence of adverse developmental effects of in utero exposure to neurotoxins such as PCBs and DDE ( Grandjean and Landrigan 2014 ). In a cohort of 573 mother\u2013child pairs from Massachusetts, Sagiv et al. ( 2010 ) reported an association between umbilical cord serum levels of four PCB congeners [median (5th\u201395th percentile): 0.19\u2009(0.01,\u20094.41)\u2009ng/g] and DDE [median (5th\u201395th percentile): 0.31\u2009(0.00,\u200914.93)\u2009ng/g]; they also reported ADHD-like symptoms in children at 8 y of age measured with the Conners\u2019 Rating Scale for Teachers (CRS-T). Those results are generally consistent with our findings for prenatal p,p \u2032-DDE exposures, although abnormal hyperactivity scores were associated with prenatal PCB-153 exposures in only one of the two cohorts included in our analysis. In the same cohort, Verner et al. ( 2015 ) found   ADHD-related behavior (assessed by the CRS-T) and estimated postnatal PCB exposure for the first 12 months after delivery calculated using a pharmacokinetic model. In our study, we used the same pharmacokinetic model ( Verner et al. 2013 ) to calculate postnatal exposure to PCB-153 and p,p \u2032-DDE, and we observed that   similarly tended to be attenuated when comparing postnatal exposures with prenatal exposures. Another study found that maternal whole blood levels of three PCB congeners [arithmetic mean (SD): 0.19\u2002(0.18)\u2009\u03bcg/g lipid] were associated with lowered attention function in a German birth cohort, but the number of participants was small ( n =117) ( Neugebauer et al. 2015 ). \nHowever, studies have also reported null findings for   PCBs, DDE, and behavior in children. Grandjean et al. ( 2012 ) studied a cohort of 917 seven-year-old children from the Faroe Islands and reported that attention [based on a Continuous Performance Test (CPT)] was positively associated with cord blood levels of DDE but was not clearly associated with the sum of four PCB congeners (geometric\u2009mean=1.86 \u03bcg/L; interquartile range: 2 \u03bcg/L). This finding is in contrast to those of our study, which showed a positive association between prenatal and postnatal p,p \u2032-DDE exposures and abnormal hyperactivity scores. Nevertheless, it is difficult to compare the studies given the different outcome ascertainment methods and behavioral aspects (i.e., attention vs. behavior) and the different exposure assessments (i.e., measured in maternal serum vs. cord blood). In a Danish cohort of 872 pregnant women, the sum of six PCB congeners [median (interquartile range): 9.2\u2002(5.3)\u2009pmol/mL] and DDE [median (interquartile range): 2.5\u2002(2.2)\u2009ng/mL] was measured in serum between 1988 and 1989, and the children were followed up through national registers until 2011 for diagnosis or prescription of medication for ADHD ( Str\u00f8m et al. 2014 ). The study showed no association between prenatal exposure to PCB or DDE and ADHD ( Str\u00f8m et al. 2014 ). These results, in which the outcome was ADHD medication and ADHD diagnosis of children followed up beyond childhood, are difficult to compare with those of our study, where behavioral symptoms, including hyperactivity and conduct problem dimensions, were reported by parents for children between 5 and 9 y of age. A follow-up of two Spanish birth cohorts ( n =391) showed an association between hexachlorobenzene and adverse social competences and ADHD-like behavior, but the investigators found no association for cord blood levels of PCB (concentration not given) and DDE (concentration not given) ( Ribas-Fit\u00f3 et al. 2007b ). On the basis of the existing literature, it is difficult to draw a clear conclusion about the effects of the compounds on child behavior given the limited number of studies and because not all studies are directly comparable. Differences may be due to different rating scales; ages of the children at assessment; ages of the mothers; exposure levels; measured congeners; measurement error; whether the compounds were tested in cord blood, serum, or placental tissue; potential influence of uncontrolled confounding; and differences in susceptibility among populations. \nThe possible biological mechanisms behind behavioral disturbances and early-life exposure to PCBs and DDE are still unknown. However, studies have shown an association between the compounds and altered thyroid function. Herbstman et al. ( 2008 ) found an association between cord blood levels of six PCB congeners and lowered total thyroxin levels in infants born by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Similarly, Julvez et al. ( 2011 ) found an association for cord blood levels of four PCB congeners and p,p \u2032-DDE with lowered resin triiodothyronine uptake ratio (a proxy of the binding capacity of thyroxine-binding globulin responsible for carrying thyroid hormones in the bloodstream). Altered thyroid function may affect development of the fetal brain ( Morreale de Escobar et al. 2004 ). Furthermore, it has also been suggested that PCBs might affect neurodevelopment through diverse mechanisms related to endocrine disruption ( Bell 2014 ). In addition, animal studies have shown that PCBs can alter the dopaminergic levels in the brain, which may lead to cognitive and behavioral impairment of the fetus during pregnancy ( Arnsten 1997 ; Caudle et al. 2006 ; Seegal et al. 1997 , 2002 ). \nThis study has some limitations. Participation rates at baseline were 90% in Greenland and 26% in Ukraine, and although a nonresponse analysis at baseline showed almost no difference in age or parity among participants and nonparticipants in either cohort ( Toft et al. 2005 ), we cannot rule out selection bias. A commonly stated reason for nonparticipation among women from Ukraine was a concern that collection of the blood sample might be harmful to the fetus. The decision to participate at both baseline and follow-up was made without knowledge of the prenatal or postnatal exposure levels. \nBlood samples were collected throughout pregnancy, mainly in the second and third trimesters. Because PCBs and DDE tend to decrease throughout pregnancy, exposure misclassification might occur ( Adetona et al. 2013 ; Glynn et al. 2011 ). We addressed this possibility in a sensitivity analysis adjusting for gestational age at blood sampling, which did not change the results (data not shown). For that reason, differences in gestational age at blood sampling do not seem to be of major concern. \nIn addition, we had no measurements of the postnatal exposure to PCB-153 and p,p \u2032-DDE and used a pharmacokinetic model to estimate the cumulative exposure in the first 12 months after delivery. The model has been validated in a similar setting ( Verner et al. 2013 ) and has previously been used in the same birth cohort ( H\u00f8yer et al. 2014 ). Nevertheless, exact measures of the postnatal exposures would have been preferable. \nAs the outcome measure, we used the SDQ, which can be applied internationally and has been thoroughly validated in the British population ( Goodman et al. 2000 ; Goodman 2001 ). The SDQ is not a diagnostic tool, but it can be used as a screening tool to assess the mental health of children as both a total score and on five different subscales. \nBecause SDQ cut-off points were not validated in the Greenlandic and Ukrainian populations, we used the general cut-off points given by Goodman ( 1997 ) for the British population, which could lead to misclassification of the outcome estimate. We addressed this possibility in a sensitivity analysis using the top 10th percentile as the cut-off, which did not alter the results considerably. Furthermore, studies have provided evidence of useful psychometric properties of the SDQ across different Nordic countries including Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland ( Obel et al. 2004 ), and to some extent in countries beyond Europe, including Brazil, Yemen, and Australia ( Woerner et al. 2004 ). \nAnalyses were repeated using two-pollutant models that were mutually adjusted for PCB-153 and p,p \u2032-DDE during the same time period. As expected, estimates were less precise when the highly correlated exposures were included in the same model. However, associations with p,p \u2032-DDE were generally consistent with the primary model estimates after adjustment for PCB-153, whereas associations with PCB-153 were somewhat more likely to be attenuated when adjusted for coexposure to p,p \u2032-DDE. \nThe proportions of participants classified as having abnormal total difficulties scores (6% in Greenland and 5% in Ukraine) were consistent with expectations ( Elberling et al. 2010 ; Goodman et al. 2000 ), but the absolute numbers of children classified were small (30 in Greenland and 27 in Ukraine with abnormal total difficulties scores among children included in the study). In addition to limiting the precision of our estimates, this also limited our ability to adjust for potential confounders, particularly those with missing data for some study participants. To ensure sufficient power in relation to the number of missing values, we chose to adjust our main analysis only for maternal age at birth, maternal smoking during pregnancy, child\u2019s sex, and child\u2019s age at follow-up. Other covariates such as parity, maternal educational level, gestational age at blood sampling, and gestational age at birth were addressed in secondary analyses and did not change the estimate substantially (data not shown). \nThe strengths of our study include the prospective follow-up design. The follow-up period of 5 to 9 y enabled us to estimate associations of early-life exposures with behavioral outcomes in school-age children. In addition, the study population of mother\u2013child pairs from Greenland and Ukraine enabled us to evaluate the consistency of   across different regions and exposure contrasts. Despite differences between Greenland and Ukraine regarding baseline characteristics (maternal age at delivery, parity, maternal educational level, alcohol consumption at the time of conception, smoking during pregnancy, and breastfeeding duration) and differences in exposure levels, remarkably similar   organochlorine exposures and behavior outcomes, measured as total difficulties as well as conduct and hyperactivity problems, were observed in results stratified by country. Conclusion \nWe found no clear association between total difficulties scores and either prenatal or postnatal exposure to PCB-153 or p,p \u2032-DDE. However, for the subscale scores, the results of this study indicated that prenatal and postnatal exposure to p,p \u2032-DDE may increase the risk of conduct problems and, to some extent, the risk of hyperactivity in children at 5 to 9 y of age. Associations were less consistent for prenatal and postnatal PCB-153 exposures; nevertheless, we found a nonsignificant positive association for abnormal conduct scores in both cohorts. Our findings provide evidence that in utero exposure to organochlorines such as PCBs and DDE may contribute to adverse behavioral development and emaphasize the importance of minimizing organochlorine exposures to children and to women of childbearing age.

found that genetics-based dosing for the blood thinner warfarin reduces the risk of major side effects in older patients starting the medication. The findings support previous studies showing that personalized dosing can improve the safety of certain medications. A patient\u2019s genetic makeup could help guide doctors for more effective medication dosing. Ryan McVay/Photodisc/Thinkstock \nBlood thinners, or anticoagulants, are often prescribed to help prevent blood clots that can lead to pulmonary embolism, heart attack, and stroke. Though effective at preventing these clots, warfarin can cause life-threatening bleeds. Warfarin has led to more emergency room visits for older people over the last decade than any other medication. This is because it can be difficult for doctors to determine the right dose. \nWhen a patient first starts warfarin, doctors usually choose the dose based on clinical information, such as a patient\u2019s age and weight. They then adjust that dose as needed based on blood testing. However, this trial-and-error dosing can be dangerous. Too much warfarin can cause excess bleeding; too little may not prevent dangerous blood clots. \nA team of scientists led by Dr. Brian F. Gage at Washington University in St. Louis investigated whether genetic testing can help predict the best warfarin dose to give a patient. They compared outcomes for patients whose initial doses were based on clinical information alone to those whose initial doses were based on their genetic makeup (genotype) along with clinical factors. The trial was funded primarily by NIH\u2019s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Results appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association on September 26, 2017. \nPatients who were starting warfarin after elective hip or knee replacement at six medical centers across the US were recruited to participate. They were randomly assigned to have warfarin prescribed based on either clinical information alone (819 patients) or based on clinical information plus genotype (831 patients). All participants were at least 65 years old; 63.6% were women; and 91% were white. \nThe researchers collected blood samples from the patients and screened for genetic differences in the genes VKORC1 , CYP2C9 , and CYP4F2 , which are related to blood clotting and warfarin metabolism or sensitivity. Doctors monitored each group and adjusted the warfarin dosage to reach a target blood thinning level over 11 days. Warfarin was continued for 35 days. Adverse events were tracked for 90 days, including major bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. \nThere were fewer adverse events in the genotype-guided dosing group: 87 events, or 10.8% of the genetic group, vs. 116 events, or 14.7% of the clinically guided group. No patient died during the study. \n\u201cWarfarin is very effective in preventing blood clots, but it\u2019s very difficult to regulate,\u201d explains Dr. Anne R. Bass, a study co-author at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. \u201cAbout half of the population, because of genetic variants, is very sensitive to warfarin or has a very unpredictable or delayed response to the drug. This is the first study to show that adjusting the dose based on these genetic variants makes warfarin safer for patients.\u201d \n\u201cAlthough genetic testing is more expensive than clinical dosing, the cost is falling,\u201d Gage says. \u201cIn our study, we estimated that genetic testing costs less than $200 per person, which is less than one month of a newer anticoagulant.\u201d \nA previous study didn\u2019t find genotyping improved warfarin dosing. That study used two of these genes and was done in a group that was 27% African-American. More work is needed to investigate how genetic variants can help guide dosing in different populations. \n\u2014Tianna Hicklin, Ph.D.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anne r. bass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan mcvay/photodisc/thinkstock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014tianna hicklin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian f. gage", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national heart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blood institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhlbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T08:45:21.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fdc6ab85e13cefd1346d8da114de99e774e6e810", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuN2QXrC9nKjkr1wEwPu0FWRhqGFoh2kCq5ZBN7cnGgQ_9x13Ksys.2Ng9LSeut8dAEdMMRQYHUTciYJJTpFxvSP5lCEJBJ0oaE4wmTzaekcANd5RKWQ.UKH1Q2KpvFv0-", "site_full": "www.nih.gov", "site": "nih.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/feed.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "NIH Research Matters", "title": "Engineered antibody protects monkeys from HIV-like virus", "title_full": "Engineered antibody protects monkeys from HIV-like virus", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 331, "comments": 0, "shares": 331}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fdc6ab85e13cefd1346d8da114de99e774e6e810", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTuN2QXrC9nKjkr1wEwPu0FWRhqGFoh2kCq5ZBN7cnGgQ_9x13Ksys.2Ng9LSeut8dAEdMMRQYHUTciYJJTpFxvSP5lCEJBJ0oaE4wmTzaekcANd5RKWQ.UKH1Q2KpvFv0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Engineered antibody protects monkeys from HIV-like virus", "text": "Engineered antibody protects monkeys from HIV-like virus At a Glance A \u201cthree-in-one\u201d antibody made in the laboratory protected monkeys from infection with an HIV-related virus better than the natural antibodies from which it was derived.

The blue, purple and green segments each bind to a different critical site on the virus. Sanofi \nHIV, the virus that causes AIDS, attacks the body\u2019s immune system, making people vulnerable to other infections and diseases. Treatments can control HIV infection, but the virus persists in the body for a lifetime. An effective vaccine has been elusive, in part because of the diversity of HIV strains. \nResearchers have isolated antibodies from people living with HIV that can neutralize multiple strains of HIV. By studying these broadly neutralizing antibodies, they\u2019ve gained important insights into how the antibodies bind to the virus and why they\u2019re effective. Investigators from NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the pharmaceutical company Sanofi set out to create more potent broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies. The team was led by Dr. John R. Mascola, director of the NIAID Vaccine Research Center, and Dr. Gary J. Nabel, Sanofi chief scientific officer and senior vice president. The work appeared online in Science on September 20, 2017. \nThe researchers combined portions of individual broadly neutralizing antibodies to engineer a series of antibodies in the laboratory. They created dozens of \u201cbispecific\u201d (binding to two different sites on the virus) and \u201ctrispecific\u201d (binding to three different sites) antibodies. Testing revealed the most successful to be a trispecific antibody that combined parts of the broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies VRC01, PGDM1400, and 10E8v4. This single engineered molecule interacts with three independent parts of the HIV surface. \nInfusions of the three-pronged antibody completely protected eight monkeys from infection with two strains of SHIV, a monkey form of HIV. In contrast, infusions of the individual antibodies from which the engineered antibody was derived were only partially protective. The trispecific antibody also prevented a broader range of HIV strains from infecting cells in the laboratory. \nSanofi is manufacturing the trispecific antibody for use in a Phase 1 clinical trial that NIAID is planning to conduct. The trial will test the antibody\u2019s safety and effects in healthy people beginning in late 2018. Discussions also are under way for a separate Phase 1 clinical trial of the antibody in people living with HIV. \n\u201cCombinations of antibodies that each bind to a distinct site on HIV may best overcome the defenses of the virus in the effort to achieve effective antibody-based treatment and prevention,\u201d says NIAID Director Dr. Anthony S. Fauci. \u201cThe concept of having a single antibody that binds to three unique sites on HIV is certainly an intriguing approach for investigators to pursue.\u201d \nThe ability of trispecific antibodies to bind to three independent targets could make them useful for other types of treatments as well. Other potential targets include infectious diseases and cancers.

However, these drugs may have unwanted side effects in other parts of the body. Being able to deliver drugs directly to white fat may prevent or reduce side effects. Previous research showed that nanoparticles could deliver browning drugs to convert white fat cells into beige fat cells. Nanoparticles are microscopic particles that can be used to carry drugs and other substances in the body. \nA team of researchers led by Drs. Li Qiang of Columbia University and Zhen Gu of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University set out to design a microneedle skin patch that could switch on fat browning in a targeted region. The study was supported by NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Results were published on September 26, 2017, in ACS Nano . \nThe research team designed a skin patch with 121 cone-shaped polymer needles that can be filled with a drug encapsulated by nanoparticles. The tiny needles penetrate the skin and the ends collapse. The nanoparticles then slowly release the browning drug into the fat cells. By delivering the drug directly to fat cells, the drug\u2019s side effects in other parts of the body might be prevented or minimized. \nThe researchers tested the skin patch, which was a little larger than a pencil eraser, on the abdominal fat pads of three groups of normal mice. The first group received a skin patch without any drug; the second group received a patch containing rosiglitazone (a diabetes drug that\u2019s also known as Rosi or by its trade name Avandia); and the third group received a patch containing a compound called CL 316243. In mice treated with either drug, the white fat cells shrunk and beige fat cells appeared. A genetic analysis and other tests confirmed that both drugs induced fat browning and improved metabolism in the mice. \nThe research team then treated obese mice with skin patches for 4 weeks. The drugs increased browning, as evidenced by smaller fat cells and increased expression of brown fat cell genes. They also reduced the size of the fat pad and improved metabolic signs. \n\u201cThere are several clinically available drugs that promote browning, but all must be given as pills or injections,\u201d Qiang says. \u201cThis exposes the whole body to the drugs, which can lead to side effects such as stomach upset, weight gain, and bone fractures. Our skin patch appears to alleviate these complications by delivering most drugs directly to fat tissue.\u201d The microneedle skin patch seems promising, but has not been tested in people. \n\u2014by Geri Piazza ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T08:45:23.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "79cc2d50860d7a750f079aef40f595a9a2cedb75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRZ92Rdv6LtBxl5Ipzo3.QjVHXOofxqUHl3BaLTt2MjLHADiNUI6w4piFYq9QYg7.M-", "site_full": "videocast.nih.gov", "site": "nih.gov", "site_section": "http://videocast.nih.gov/rss/All.asp", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "Videocast - All Events", "title": "Control of Skin Immunity by Non-Immune Cells", "title_full": "Control of Skin Immunity by Non-Immune Cells", "published": "2017-10-03T18:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "79cc2d50860d7a750f079aef40f595a9a2cedb75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRZ92Rdv6LtBxl5Ipzo3.QjVHXOofxqUHl3BaLTt2MjLHADiNUI6w4piFYq9QYg7.M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Control of Skin Immunity by Non-Immune Cells", "text": "Wednesday, October 18, 2017, 4:15:00 PM   Immunonology IG Seminar The skin is a barrier organ that is a frequent site of entry for numerous pathogens. The skin is able to resist infection through a variety of mechanisms including innate and adaptive immune responses. Resident memory T cells (TRM) are a recently appreciated subset of memory T cells that reside in the skin and are required for optimal protection against previously encountered pathogens. These cells also participate in a number of cutaneous autoimmune diseases including vitiligo, psoriasis and alopecia areata. The skin also contains several populations innate immune cells that provide pathogen protection during the initial contact with a pathogen. Our work focuses on understanding how peripheral nerves in the skin as well as keratinocytes that form the structure of the epidermis interact with the local cutaneous immune system to provide optimal resistance to pathogens. We found that the residence of epidermal TRM and dendritic cells requires the presence of activated TGF\u03b21. TGF\u03b21 is secreted from several sources but, notably, the key regulated step was the obligate activation of TGF\u03b21 by the integrins av\u03b26 and av\u03b28 that are expressed by keratinocytes. Antibody mediated blockade of these integrins resulted in loss of TRM from the epidermis highlighting the important function of keratinocytes in determining the epidermal occupancy TRM. We also found that pain sensing neurons in the skin can directly sense the presence of invasive C. albicans resulting in elaboration of the neuropeptide CGRP. CGPR was required for a local inflammatory cascade involving dendritic cell and TCR \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation, the elaboration of IL-17 and ultimately host defense to C. albicans. In summary, both nerves in the skin and keratinocytes play a key role in modulating cutaneous immunity and represent novels potential therapeutic targets to augment host defense and/or suppress autoimmune diseases.

The results further suggest the vessels could act as a pipeline between the brain and the immune system. \n\u201cWe literally watched people\u2019s brains drain fluid into these vessels,\u201d said Daniel S. Reich, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator at the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the senior author of the study published online in eLife . \u201cWe hope that our results provide new insights to a variety of neurological disorders.\u201d \nDr. Reich is a radiologist and neurologist who primarily uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders which are thought to involve the immune system. Led by post-doctoral fellows, Martina Absinta, Ph.D. and Seung-Kwon Ha, Ph.D., along with researchers from the National Cancer Institute, the team discovered lymphatic vessels in the dura, the leathery outer coating of the brain. \nLymphatic vessels are part of the body\u2019s circulatory system. In most of the body they run alongside blood vessels. They transport lymph, a colorless fluid containing immune cells and waste, to the lymph nodes. Blood vessels deliver white blood cells to an organ and the lymphatic system removes the cells and recirculates them through the body. The process helps the immune system detect whether an organ is under attack from bacteria or viruses or has been injured. \nIn 1816, an Italian anatomist reported finding lymphatic vessels on the surface of the brain, but for two centuries, it was forgotten. Until very recently, researchers in the modern era found no evidence of a lymphatic system in the brain, leaving some puzzled about how the brain drains waste, and others to conclude that brain is an exceptional organ. Then in 2015, two studies of mice found evidence of the brain\u2019s lymphatic system in the dura. Coincidentally, that year, Dr. Reich saw a presentation by Jonathan Kipnis, Ph.D., a professor at the University of Virginia and an author of one the mouse studies. \n\u201cI was completely surprised. In medical school, we were taught that the brain has no lymphatic system,\u201d said Dr. Reich. \u201cAfter Dr. Kipnis\u2019 talk, I thought, maybe we could find it in human brains?\u201d \nTo look for the vessels, Dr. Reich\u2019s team used MRI to scan the brains of five healthy volunteers who had been injected with gadobutrol, a magnetic dye typically used to visualize brain blood vessels damaged by diseases, such as multiple sclerosis or cancer. The dye molecules are small enough to leak out of blood vessels in the dura but too big to pass through the blood-brain barrier and enter other parts of the brain. \nAt first, when the researchers set the MRI to see blood vessels, the dura lit up brightly, and they could not see any signs of the lymphatic system. But, when they tuned the scanner differently, the blood vessels disappeared, and the researchers saw that dura also contained smaller but almost equally bright spots and lines which they suspected were lymph vessels. The results suggested that the dye leaked out of the blood vessels, flowed through the dura and into neighboring lymphatic vessels. \nTo test this idea, the researchers performed another round of scans on two subjects after first injecting them with a second dye made up of larger molecules that leak much less out of blood vessels. In contrast with the first round of scans, the researchers saw blood vessels in the dura but no lymph vessels regardless of how they tuned the scanner, confirming their suspicions. \nThey also found evidence for blood and lymph vessels in the dura of autopsied human brain tissue. Moreover, their brain scans and autopsy studies of brains from nonhuman primates confirmed the results seen in humans, suggesting the lymphatic system is a common feature of mammalian brains. \n\u201cThese results could fundamentally change the way we think about how the brain and immune system inter-relate,\u201d said Walter J. Koroshetz, M.D., NINDS director. \nDr. Reich\u2019s team plans to investigate whether the lymphatic system works differently in patients who have multiple sclerosis or other neuroinflammatory disorders. \n\u201cFor years we knew how fluid entered the brain. Now we may finally see that, like other organs in the body, brain fluid can drain out through the lymphatic system,\u201d said Dr. Reich. \nArticle: \nAbsinta, Ha et al.

The Niche Assessment program provides a third party, unbiased assessment of appropriate market niches for products/services that are being developed by HHS SBIR/STTR Phase I awardees and is carried out by Foresight Science & Technology on behalf of NIH. Using its Technology Niche Analysis\u00ae (TNA\u00ae), Foresight will perform the due diligence on markets appropriate for each SBIR technology and develop an in-depth report for each SBIR/STTR awardee that addresses: -- needs and concerns of end-users -- competing technologies and competing products -- competitive advantage of the SBIR/STTR-developed technology -- market size and potential market share (may include national and/or global markets) -- barriers to market entry (may include, but is not limited to pricing, competition, government regulations, manufacturing challenges, capital requirements, etc.) -- market drivers -- status of market and industry trends -- potential customers, licensees, investors, or other commercialization partners -- price customers are likely to pay \nThe analysis has three steps: \n(1) In the first step, Foresight will gather the pertinent information needed from the SBIR/STTR awardee to identify feasible applications of the technology. Often times, several non-obvious uses are found, and such secondary applications may provide a path to market that is faster than the primary biomedical use. (2) In the second step, Foresight will analyze the selected use of the technology to determine the end-user needs, current and emerging competing technologies, market dynamics, socio-economic trends and market drivers, and to quantify the market size and participant's possible share. This second step determines the technology's current competitive advantages and how to improve competitiveness. (3) In the third step, Foresight will recommend a market entry strategy. This strategy includes how to market the technology to end-users, how to obtain outside partners, and also projects revenues for the technology. Likely lead customers, testing centers, suppliers, manufacturers, and/or other relevant organizations interested in participating in the downstream research as beta testers or concurrent engineering advisors will be identified. To validate the analyses and recommendations, Foresight will identify and qualify companies or funding agencies that might be interested in becoming commercialization partners. Follow-up communication with these potential partners will be the responsibility of the small business. The Niche Assessment Program is appropriate for all types of technologies, e.g., those developing clinical products such as devices, drugs, biologics, and therapeutics, as well as those developing software, educational, and multi-media behavioral science products. The program is also appropriate for those seeking strategic alliances, investors, and/or immediate customers. \nOne hundred seventy-five (175) slots are available and will be filled on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis. For those with multiple awards, only one project per company will be accepted for the program. The average time to complete a Technology Niche Analysis\u00ae is 2 to 3 months. Since reports will be generated in the order the applications were received, all 175 reports will be completed between November 2017 and early March 2018. However, awardees may indicate a preference when they would like to receive the TNA\u00ae report in the registration forms below. NIH and Foresight will try to accommodate such preferences if possible. The Technology Niche Analysis\u00ae report may be helpful in the preparation of the commercialization plan that is required in a SBIR/STTR Phase II application and, as such, applicants should consider the timing of their Phase II submission. The amount of time a program participant will need to expend is minimal (only a few hours) and participation is free. Participants must meet the SBIR/STTR small business eligibility criteria as described in the current SBIR and STTR Parent Funding Opportunity Announcement available from the NIH Small Business Funding Opportunities website http://sbir.nih.gov . \nTo participate in the program, complete the on-line registration form available at: \nFor assistance with submitting the on-line Set-Up Form please contact: \nPaula Williams", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paula williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "niche assessment program", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sttr awardees", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nih", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hhs sbir", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "related announcements  national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nih small business funding opportunities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "technology niche analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sbir", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T20:47:35.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa8c037d66e0a817b379594563f70ab4c09ab8fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQsB2jgx9jsTBgsUIAJUADWSb1s4AFRPC8SR.B_7R8zwOR59AGVbvdG", "site_full": "rxnav.nlm.nih.gov", "site": "nih.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/rss/umlsnews.rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "UMLS News", "title": "New RxCUI History API", "title_full": "New RxCUI History API", "published": "2017-10-04T01:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa8c037d66e0a817b379594563f70ab4c09ab8fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQsB2jgx9jsTBgsUIAJUADWSb1s4AFRPC8SR.B_7R8zwOR59AGVbvdG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T01:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "New RxCUI History API", "text": "RxCUI History API The RxCUI History API is a RESTful web service for RxNorm concept history.

Min Liu and Rajat Banerjee. \nThe National Institutes of Health announced today that it has issued four awards totaling approximately $1 million each per year to support outstanding researchers in their pursuit of high-risk, high-reward projects with the possibility to profoundly enhance our understanding of dental, oral, and craniofacial diseases and conditions. The support will go to scientists who are investigating skeletal tissue regeneration, craniofacial malformations, head and neck cancer, and links between viral infections and oral inflammation. \nThe Sustaining Outstanding Achievement in Research (SOAR) awards, issued by the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), provide up to eight years of grant support to allow mid-career investigators with outstanding records of productivity to have stable funding to pursue potentially transformative research programs. \n\u201cTo ensure the long-term stability of the biomedical research enterprise, we must encourage successful, independent careers for early-stage investigators and retain them as they become more established,\u201d said NIDCR Director Martha Somerman, D.D.S., Ph.D. \u201cThe SOAR awards will enable these outstanding investigators to continue their career trajectories while pursuing dental, oral, and craniofacial research projects that have the potential to break new ground and ultimately improve human health.\u201d \nNIDCR created the SOAR awards in 2015 to sustain exceptional scientists through a challenging early-established career phase, when many researchers are at risk for leaving the biomedical workforce due to a hypercompetitive funding environment. NIDCR issued the first round of SOAR awards in 2016, with support to two researchers, one focused on tooth regeneration and the other on human papilloma virus (for more about the initial grants, see Mid-Career Funding Helps Scientists Answer Big Questions ) \n\u201cWe are delighted that this round of funding will support diverse areas of dental, oral, and craniofacial science,\u201d said Lillian Shum, Ph.D., director of NIDCR\u2019s Division of Extramural Research. \u201cInstead of focusing on several short-term projects, as is typical in academia, each investigator will be able to combine their separate but related areas of interest into one larger research program that could significantly advance the field.\u201d \nThe 2017 NIDCR SOAR investigators are: \nSamantha Brugmann, Ph.D., Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Dr. Brugmann studies neural crest cells that give rise to the facial skeleton during development. Her work seeks to direct neural crest cells to develop into skeletal tissues that can be used to surgically repair craniofacial malformations. \nGage Crump, Ph.D., University of Southern California, Los Angeles Dr. Crump uses zebrafish models to unravel the developmental causes of congenital disorders of the head and face and to understand how stem cells build, maintain, and repair bones in the head. Ultimately, this knowledge could lead to regenerative medicine treatments for human craniofacial diseases. \nNisha D\u2019Silva, Ph.D., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Dr. D\u2019Silva examines the molecular pathways that control the spread and recurrence of head and neck cancer. Her findings may ultimately enable clinicians to identify patients who will best respond to existing treatments, and might also lead to new treatment strategies. \nPinghui Feng, Ph.D., University of Southern California, Los Angeles Dr. Feng\u2019s research explores the link between human herpesviruses (e.g. herpes simplex virus and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) and chronic oral inflammation, which can cause gum disease. Understanding these molecular mechanisms may lead to therapies for oral and other inflammatory diseases. \nNIDCR\u2019s SOAR awards reflect a broader trans-NIH effort to develop additional strategies to grow and retain talented scientists across critical career stages. In August 2017 NIH launched the Next Generation Researchers Initiative , which places greater emphasis on current NIH funding mechanisms aimed at early and early-established investigators, such as NIDCR\u2019s SOAR program, the NIH Common Fund\u2019s New Innovator Awards , the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\u2019 Supplements to Advance Research (STAR) from Projects to Program , and the National Institute of General Medicine Sciences\u2019 Maximizing Investigators\u2019 Research Award (MIRA) . \nThe National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) is the nation\u2019s leading funder of research on oral, dental, and craniofacial health.

Frank shares the award jointly with Jacques Dubochet, Ph.D., of the University of Geneva and University of Basel, Switzerland, and Richard Henderson, Ph.D., of Cambridge University, for the development of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which both simplifies and improves the imaging of biomolecules. \nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said, \u201cThis method has moved biochemistry into a new era.\u201d \nKnowing the structure of a molecule reveals important information about how it functions and can provide insight into potential drug targets for fighting disease. Cryo-EM is a method used to image frozen biological molecules without the use of structure-altering dyes or fixatives or the need to coax the molecules into crystalline form, providing a simpler way to generate pictures of the molecules in their normal states and greater understanding of biological function. With cryo-EM, researchers can advance understanding of life\u2019s chemistry and develop pharmaceuticals. \n\u201cThe work of these Nobel laureates has been game-changing in our understanding of life\u2019s processes and identifying molecular targets for drug development,\u201d said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. \u201cNIH is investing heavily in the further development of this technology through the NIH Common Funds\u2019 Transformative High Resolution cryo-EM Program, which aims to improve access for researchers through the creation of national service centers, continued advancement of the technology, and developing the skills that researchers need to use this technology. NIH is proud to have supported this groundbreaking research.\u201d \nDr. Frank has received continuous funding from NIH\u2019s National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) since 1978, having received more than $25 million in funding to date. \n\u201cOne of the beauties of this Prize is that it isn\u2019t just looking backward at what happened in the past, it\u2019s also looking to the future,\u201d said NIGMS Director Jon R.

The Alcohol Treatment Navigator , designed by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), part of the National Institutes of Health, is a comprehensive, yet easy-to-use tool to help individuals and their loved ones navigate the often-complicated process of choosing treatment for alcohol problems. With many treatment options available, the navigator makes the search easier by telling them what they need to know - and what they need to do \u2013 to find appropriate, quality care. \n\u201cWe developed this tool to help address the alcohol \u2018treatment gap,\u2019\u201d said NIAAA Director George F. Koob, Ph.D. \u201cIn any given year, less than 10 percent of individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorder receive treatment, and many of them do not receive the type of care that best fits their needs. A big reason for that, we believe, is that people with alcohol use disorder often don\u2019t know where to turn for help. The Alcohol Treatment Navigator offers a comprehensive strategy to help people search for professionally-led, evidence-based alcohol treatment, which should improve their chances for success.\u201d \nThe release of the Alcohol Treatment Navigator culminates a nearly two-year development effort grounded in a review of decades of scientific research on clinical interventions and health services, and with input from people seeking alcohol treatment, treatment providers, and researchers. \n\u201cGood alcohol treatment can be very hard to find,\u201d said Lori Ducharme, Ph.D., NIAAA\u2019s program director for Health Services Research and lead developer of the navigator. \u201cKnowing where to look for treatment is difficult, mainly because treatment takes many forms which often are not well integrated into general health care. That makes it hard for people to find the kind of care that they need, when they need it. The navigator is designed to take the mystery and frustration out of that search by guiding them through a step-by-step process to find a qualified treatment provider.\u201d \nAnother factor, notes Dr. Ducharme, are popular stereotypes about alcohol treatment. Many people think their only treatment options are either a mutual help group or a long-term residential rehab facility. While those options certainly can be helpful for some people, they are not a good fit for everyone. \n\u201cIn fact, a theme of the navigator is that different people need different options,\u201d said Dr. Ducharme. \u201cWe need to help people understand the whole range of treatment options that are available, how to find one that meets their unique needs and preferences, and that treatments with the strongest chances for success are those that are informed by the results of rigorous scientific research on alcohol use disorder.\u201d \nOverall, the Alcohol Treatment Navigator is an easy-to-use and comprehensive resource that can inform the search for quality treatment. It includes: An overview of alcohol use disorder A description of different kinds of professionally-led treatment options Step-by-step instructions for searching several existing online directories of treatment providers, including information from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Behavioral Health Treatment Locator Ten questions to ask a provider, and 5 signs of quality to listen for A downloadable Toolkit to help organize and simplify the search process \nAs its name implies, the navigator is designed to help point the way to evidence-based alcohol treatment options delivered by skilled health professionals, and to help people choose the best options for their specific situations. \nAbout the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA): The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health, is the primary U.S. agency for conducting and supporting research on the causes, consequences, prevention, and treatment of alcohol use disorder.

Nonetheless, the individual contribution of PM 2.5 was comparable in magnitude to any single individual- or neighborhood-level factor. For SGA, PM 2.5 explained 4.5% (95% CI: 1.0%; 6.8%) of the black\u2013white difference, in comparison with 3.8% (95% CI: 3.0%; 4.5%) and 5.2% (95% CI: 4.7%; 5.7%) for neighborhood poverty and individual Medicaid enrollment, respectively. When considering a composite index of neighborhood socioeconomic environment instead of four distinct variables, the results were similar (see Table S6). We note that, when using this composite index, the overall contribution of the neighborhood socioeconomic environment was slightly reduced for all birth outcomes. This circumstance highlights some possible overlap between the different neighborhood socioeconomic environment factors. Discussion Summary of Findings and Comparison to Existing Research \nWe analyzed births in California to identify the relative contributions of maternal variables, the social environment, and the physical environment to black\u2013white disparities in PTB. Our decomposition approach, which is well-suited to examining disparities but remains rarely used in public health research ( Lhila and Long 2012 ), finds that our included predictors explain approximately 38% of the PTB disparity. Black\u2013white differences in maternal and neighborhood socioeconomic predictors account for roughly the same amount of the disparity (17.5% and 16.1%, respectively). Our results suggest that, in addition to existing disparities-reduction efforts, policies that reduce air pollution may not only improve overall health, but also reduce black\u2013white PTB disparities. Yet, the role of individual and neighborhood factors remains prevailing. \nFew studies decompose black\u2013white disparities in PTB ( Schempf et al. 2011 ; Auger et al. 2013 ), and only one employs the Blinder\u2013Oaxaca decomposition approach ( Lhila and Long 2012 ): thus, it is difficult to compare our main findings. We note that alternative methods to estimate nonlinear decomposition quantities have been developed. For example, Yun ( 2004 ) or Fairlie ( 2005 ) proposed an application of the Blinder\u2013Oaxaca decomposition to nonlinear models. These papers provide additional discussion of the assumptions and limitations of their respective methods. Notably, attributable disparities may be underestimated if mediators are included in models. Lhila and Long ( 2012 ) examined only metropolitan regions, used large regional areas (rather than zip code) as the geographic unit of analysis, and did not assess air pollution. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to include quantitative air pollution measures. Schempf and colleagues also examined PTB disparities using a fixed-effects approach. They found that a global neighborhood deprivation index accounted for \u223c15% of the estimated black\u2013white disparity of PTB ( Schempf et al. 2011 ). This finding appears similar in magnitude to the proportion explained by all neighborhood socioeconomic predictors in our approach. However, they found that maternal characteristics (age, education, marital status, and gravidity) accounted for about 40% of the PTB disparity, which is much larger than our decomposition estimates. Differences in study population demographics (i.e., two counties in North Carolina vs. all of California), estimation method, and variables included limit any substantive interpretation of this difference. Decomposition techniques, such as the Blinder\u2013Oaxaca decomposition, partition the gap in an outcome of interest between two groups (here racial/ethnic groups) into an \u201cexplained\u201d and an \u201cunexplained\u201d portion, while including simultaneously different contributor factors. Such an approach is particularly superior to classic approaches (such as a pooled regression with a group indicator variable) when many correlated social and environmental factors are assessed simultaneously (Elder et al. 2010). In addition, some studies analyzed the contribution of different factors in a given relationship by including all measured predictors in a standard regression model and then estimated the percentage change in the original estimate of interest by removing sequentially each factor. For example, Dadvand et al. ( 2014 ) evaluated the roles of air pollution, heat, noise, and green space in explaining the observed association between proximity to major roads and low birth weight in Spain. Although such an approach can be informative when investigating the role that a specific factor plays in the difference between two groups, it does not provide information on the explained and unexplained components of the outcome and does not allow for the assessment of several factors simultaneously. Interpretation \nThere are two main differences between past findings and ours. First, we find a greater proportional influence of neighborhood predictors for black\u2013white PTB disparities than in earlier work. This difference may arise from our use of poverty levels and linguistic isolation, which may better gauge area of deprivation and, by extension, the social stressors that may contribute to disparities in PTB ( Schempf et al. 2011 ). Second, and relatedly, we separately identified the contribution of neighborhood air pollution to disparities, an increasingly important predictor of adverse birth outcomes ( Burris et al. 2011 ; Arroyo et al. 2016 ; Stieb et al. 2012 ). Importantly, we found differences in mean annual PM 2.5 to explain nearly as much of the PTB disparity as recognized strong predictors of PTB, such as maternal age and education ( Blumenshine et al. 2010 ). Moreover, it is surprising that such a strong relationship was observed despite likely substantial misclassifications of air pollution exposure actually experienced by pregnant mothers during etiologically relevant periods. These findings cohere with environmental justice literature related to air pollution exposures ( Woodruff et al. 2003 ; Gwynn and Thurston 2001 ; O\u2019Neill et al. 2003 ). \nA substantial proportion of the black\u2013white disparity remains unexplained by our study\u2019s included factors. For example, some other modifiable factors have not been included in the study, such as cigarette smoking and/or exposure to lead or pesticides. In addition,   can be present. For example, it is possible that women living in high poverty areas may smoke more than women living in low poverty areas, and such aspect was not considered in our models. We do not believe that the residual unexplained disparity arises from group factors such as genetic ancestry (Butler and Behrman 2007). However, we would caution against such an over-interpretation of the unexplained variation. For instance, in their decomposition analysis in Brazil where a spectrum of genetic admixtures could be studied, Nyarko, et al. ( 2014 ) found individual, household, medical, and geographic factors could explain up to 94% of the disparity. Moreover, the decomposition analysis approach highlights the fact that unexplained variation can be due to factors such as variable parameterization and not only unmeasured confounding. In the decomposition procedure that was used in this study, we did not capture possible effect modification between factors that have been investigated and status of race/ethnicity. We, rather, focused on differences in exposures. Indeed, future work could consider an additive effect modification between status of race/ethnicity and each of the predictors considered in this study. For example, the environmental justice literature reports that at least two distinct types of disparities exist ( Forastiere et al. 2007 , Cartier et al. 2015 , Hajat et al. 2015 ): differential exposure (which was considered in the present study) and differential susceptibility or effect modification (which was not captured in the decomposition procedure). Such   race/ethnicity could also contribute to the residual unexplained disparity. Study Limitations and Recommendations for Further Studies \nOther major causes of PTB, including differences in individual maternal biochemical factors such as the vaginal microbiome or infections, may explain some of the disparity ( Lu et al. 2010 ; Butler and Behrman 2007). Moreover, black women may be more susceptible to inflammatory sequelae of infection due to social or biological stressors. This susceptibility may both account for some of the residual variance in disparities and partially explain some of the variance due to measured socioeconomic characteristics. We also cannot rule out the possibility that some area-level factors (e.g., poverty rate) may precede increases in air pollutants. Another limitation is related to the use of the zip code\u2013level data as a measure of neighborhood social environment. Using such a scale may not represent the local socioeconomic status (SES) environment\u2014especially in rural areas with large zip code regions\u2014and therefore, could lead to neighborhood SES exposure misclassification. Additionally, possible sensitivity analysis could be conducted in the future with further data like using the air pollution exposure only during the pregnancy period. However, we considered annual exposures, which approximate the full pregnancy exposure and has been found to be the most relevant in prior studies of air pollution and PTB ( Green et al. 2015 , Zhu et al. 2015 ). The exposure was assigned at the zip code level, which may reduce spatial variability in comparison with individual-level air pollution exposures. In addition, systematic measurements errors in air pollution levels by racial/ethnic group are possible if the monitors are not randomly spatially distributed. Another issue relates to the lack of direct comparability of units across the different measures. To facilitate the comparison of the strength of the coefficients, we used tertiles in both neighborhood and air pollution factors. \nAnother limitation of our study is that we investigated only exposure to PM 2.5 and NO 2 in this study. PM 2.5 and NO 2 are widely studied air pollutants for pregnancy outcomes ( Green et al. 2015 , Zhu et al. 2015 ). NO 2 captures the spatial variation in outdoor, urban, air pollutant mixtures ( Levy et al. 2014 ), and PM 2.5 can harm human health due to its small diameter, large surface area, and toxic chemical species that PM carries. Other co-pollutants or environmental exposures resulting from similar sources (e.g., ultrafine particles and noise) can enhance the contribution of PM 2.5 and NO 2 Implications for Public Health \nIt is well recognized that individualized, clinical perinatal interventions have not been successful in reducing either the absolute risk of PTB or other adverse birth outcomes among U.S. black women, nor in reducing disparities relative to U.S. white women ( Blumenshine et al. 2010 ; Butler et al. 2007). Recently, the importance of the contribution of differences in neighborhood environment and exposure to air pollution to black\u2013white disparities in adverse birth outcomes has received increasing attention. Our findings suggest that such a focus is warranted, because we find that measured factors such as average PM 2.5 exposure is also a contributor to racial/ethnic disparities. Reducing PM 2.5 exposure through diverse equitable air pollution policies ( Benmarhnia et al. 2014 ) in high-exposure zip codes may help reduce black\u2013white disparities in PTB.

NIH Disability Employee Awareness Program 2017 Monday, October 16, 2017, 10:  National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) is celebrated in recognition of the historical and cultural contributions of persons with disabilities. This year\u2019s national theme is \u201cInclusion Drives Innovation.\u201d The theme promotes the benefits of a united and diverse biomedical workforce by encouraging innovation through the lens of diversity and inclusion. At NIH, we continually strive to serve as a model employer of those with disabilities. We use this time to address challenges that affect their employment and focus on strategies for recruitment and retention. NIH stands ready to continue partnering with leadership, employees, and others to develop innovative policies and practices to recruit and retain people with disabilities and targeted disabilities. We stand together as an agency as we broaden our research and increase our level of awareness. I encourage everyone to show support for the panel discussion, Hiring and Retention of People with Disabilities and Targeted Disabilities. The panelists will identify best practices, recruitment strategies, partnership opportunities, and tools for strengthening the NIH workforce for people with disabilities. Additionally, a \u201cWhat Can You Do\u201d campaign will be introduced to NIH. This campaign focuses on ways for all NIH staff to make a positive impact on the issue of disability employment. Specifically, it will focus on strategies to improve the workforce, such as focusing on creativity and innovation of employees with disabilities. Let us celebrate the achievements of people with disabilities in the workplace every day, not just during the month of October. To learn more about the National Disability Employment Awareness Month campaign \u201cWhat Can You Do,\u201d please contact Alma McKune, Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, at 301-496-4547, or visit the website at http://edi.nih.gov/pwd and follow EDI on Twitter and Instagram at @NIH_EDI.

Ettinger, Robert Wright, Zhenzhen Zhang, Yun Liu, Lourdes Schnaas, Adriana Mercado-Garc\u00eda, Martha Mar\u00eda T\u00e9llez-Rojo, and Mauricio Hern\u00e1ndez-Avila \nAs a trace element, fluoride can help ward off dental cavities. Exceptionally high pre- and postnatal exposures, as seen in populations whose drinking water supplies are contaminated by natural fluoride sources, have been implicated in a number of adverse health effects. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 However, less is known about fluoride\u2019s neurotoxic risks at lower levels of exposure. A new study in Environmental Health Perspectives examines risks of exposure to prenatal fluoride at concentrations typical of the general population. 5 \nIn many countries, small amounts of fluoride are added to drinking water, salt, or milk to reduce the incidence of tooth decay. 6 , 7 , 8 The U.S. Public Health Service recommends an optimal level of 0.7 mg/L fluoride in drinking water for caries prevention. 2 Fluoride can also occur naturally in water, with concentrations exceeding 4.0 mg/L in some areas of the United States 1 ; this is the maximum contaminant level for fluoride set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 6 \nThere is some debate regarding whether fluoridation is still needed for drinking water. Fluoridation of public water supplies was started in 1945 in the United States as a preventive measure to reduce the incidence of tooth decay. 9 Most of the evidence for the benefits of fluoridation was collected prior to 1975, before widespread use of fluoride toothpastes and dental treatments 1 , 9 and before modern assessments of dietary sources of fluoride. 1 , 10 However, for people who do not have access to proper dental care, cutting off water fluoridation could cause them to get too little fluoride. \nWith high exposure\u2014typically exceeding the maximum contaminant level\u2014fluoride can accumulate in teeth and bones, causing tooth discoloration and weakness as well as bone pain and increased fracture risk. 1 An additional concern is potential neurotoxicity, particularly during fetal development and early childhood. 1 , 4 , 11 In a 2012 review of studies conducted in China and Iran, 3 children living in regions with very high levels of naturally occurring fluoride in drinking water had lower scores on intelligence tests than children living in regions with low water levels of fluoride. \nPhilippe Grandjean, a professor of environmental health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who coauthored the 2012 review, notes that the advantage of the studies in China is that they were primarily conducted in rural areas where families remained in the same place for an extended time. Therefore, when a child was examined at school age, his or her current exposure to fluoride in water likely matched his or her prenatal exposures. \u201cHowever, we do not have that kind of a setting in other parts of the world, necessarily, and particularly not in the United States,\u201d says Grandjean, who was not involved in the present study. \nThe authors of the new study 5 used data on 299 mother\u2013child pairs collected through the Early Life Exposures in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) Project. Pregnant women recruited at three Mexico City hospitals provided urine samples during gestation, and information was collected regarding their demographics, lifestyle, and medical history. Their children\u2019s cognitive ability was evaluated at 4 years of age using the McCarthy Scales of Children\u2019s Abilities, and at 6\u201312 years of age, the children completed an IQ assessment (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence) and provided urine samples. \nHigher levels of fluoride in mothers\u2019 urine during pregnancy were associated with lower cognitive and IQ scores in their children, but no association was found between the scores and the children\u2019s own fluoride levels at 6\u201312 years of age. Maternal and child urinary levels of fluoride averaged 0.90 and 0.82 mg/L, respectively. The authors estimated that each 0.5-mg/L increase in maternal urinary concentration was associated with an average decrease of 3.15 and 2.50 points in cognitive and IQ scores, respectively. The researchers recommend greater scrutiny of potential adverse effects of fluoride, particularly in pregnant women and in children. For people who get enough fluoride from toothpastes and dental treatments, fluoridated drinking water could result in overexposure. However, for people without access to proper dental care, fluoridated water is an important preventive measure.

However, the researchers could not rule out the impact of unmeasured variables, including total exposure to other neurotoxicants. \n\u201cSo little research has been done on the effects of prenatal fluoride on neurodevelopment that it is difficult to know how to interpret the implications of this study,\u201d says study coauthor Howard Hu, a professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto. \u201cThere are gaps that need to be addressed in order for the scientific world to better interpret the implications of our study. And, of course, it is just one study, and these results need to be addressed with additional studies of its kind.\u201d \nJulia R.Barrett, MS, ELS, a Madison, Wisconsin\u2013based science writer and editor, is a member of the National Association of Science Writers and the Board of Editors in the Life Sciences.

No study, however, has assessed benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in hypertensive patients who are not conventionally deemed dyslipidaemic. METHODS: \nOf 19 342 hypertensive patients (aged 40-79 years with at least three other cardiovascular risk factors) randomised to one of two antihypertensive regimens in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, 10,305 with nonfasting total cholesterol concentrations 6.5 mmol/L or less were randomly assigned additional atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo. These patients formed the lipid-lowering arm of the study. We planned follow-up for an average of 5 years, the primary endpoint being non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. Data were analysed by intention to treat. FINDINGS: \nTreatment was stopped after a median follow-up of 3.3 years. By that time, 100 primary events had occurred in the atorvastatin group compared with 154 events in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.64 [95% CI 0.50-0.83], p = 0.0005). This benefit emerged in the first year of follow-up. There was no significant heterogeneity among prespecified subgroups. Fatal and non-fatal stroke (89 atorvastatin vs 121 placebo, 0.73 [0.56-0.96], p = 0.024), total cardiovascular events (389 vs 486, 0.79 [0.69-0.90], p = 0.0005), and total coronary events (178 vs 247, 0.71 [0.59-0.86], p = 0.0005) were also significantly lowered. There were 185 deaths in the atorvastatin group and 212 in the placebo group (0.87 [0.71-1.06], p = 0.16). Atorvastatin lowered total serum cholesterol by about 1.3 mmol/L compared with placebo at 12 months, and by 1.1 mmol/L after 3 years of follow-up. INTERPRETATION: \nThe reductions in major cardiovascular events with atorvastatin are large, given the short follow-up time. These findings may have implications for future lipid-lowering guidelines.

A small study found that people with type 2 diabetes who saved their carbohydrates until the end of their meal were less likely to experience a sudden rise in their blood sugar (glucose) levels. The medical term for this spike in blood sugar levels is postprandial hyperglycaemia. \nPostprandial hyperglycaemia is best avoided as not only can it make the day-to-day symptoms of diabetes worse, it has also been linked to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. \nIt has been suggested that leaving carbohydrates until the end of a meal could slow the emptying of the stomach and give it a chance to digest the protein and vegetables first, which could help prevent a blood glucose spike. The researchers wanted to see whether this was true. \nThis study included just 16 people who ate the foods of their meal in different orders to test which order was most effective at lowering blood sugar and related hormones. They either ate carbohydrates first, carbohydrates last, or all nutrients together at the same time. \nThe researchers generally found that consuming carbohydrates last was better at lowering blood sugar levels and insulin secretion when compared to the other ways of eating carbohydrates. \nWhile the results are interesting, the study was far too small to form the basis of any firm medical guidance. For now, it's best to follow current advice, which is to consume a healthy diet and keep active to help you manage your blood sugar level. This will also help you control your weight and generally feel better. \nWhere did the story come from? \nThe study was carried out by US researchers from Weill Cornell Medical College, Columbia University and Boston Children's Hospital. It was funded by the Louis and Rachel Rudin Foundation Grant, and Diane and Darryl Mallah from The Diane and Darryl Mallah Family Foundation. \nThe study was published in the peer-reviewed BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care. It is available on an open-access basis and can be read for free online. \nThe Mail Online's coverage generalised the results to all diabetics \u2013 but the study only looked at those with type 2 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes typically require insulin injections to keep their blood sugar levels under control. \nIt also presented the findings as if they were a solid recommendation, but this is not the case, especially given this was an early-stage study using a very small number of people. \nWhat kind of research was this? \nThis was a randomised crossover trial that aimed to determine the best time during a meal to eat carbohydrates to lower blood glucose levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The researchers also wanted to explore whether changing the order in which foods were eaten during a meal had any effect on the secretion of insulin and other glucose-regulating hormones. \nPrevious research has suggested that saving carbohydrates until the end of the meal lowers blood glucose levels. This follows on from the notion that eating proteins at the start of a meal stimulates insulin secretion (which helps control glucose levels). However, data on this hypothesis is limited and the researchers of this study wanted to investigate this idea further. \nCrossover trials such as this are often used when the sample size is very small. Each person acts as their own control, which effectively increases sample size. The study would ideally need to be conducted using a much larger sample with people randomised to consume nutrients in different orders over a longer period to compare effects. \nWhat did the research involve? \nThe researchers recruited 16 people with type 2 diabetes, between the ages of 35 and 65. All the participants had a body mass index (BMI) of between 25 and 40kg/m2 (covering the range from overweight to severely obese) and had been diagnosed with diabetes within the last 10 years. \nAll 16 people consumed the same meal on three separate days spaced out one week apart, with each meal following a 12-hour overnight fast. The meals varied in terms of the order in which the nutrients were eaten. Participants were assigned the following meal types in random order: carbohydrates first, followed by protein and vegetables 10 minutes later protein and vegetables, followed by carbohydrates 10 minutes later all nutrients eaten together \nBlood samples were taken before consumption, and then at 30-minute intervals up to 180 minutes. The following were measured: glucose levels insulin levels (a hormone released in response to high glucose levels) glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1, a hormone secreted in the gut in response to food to signal the release of insulin) glucagon levels (a hormone released in response to low glucose levels) \nAll participants were instructed to maintain their usual level of diet and physical activity during the full study period. \nWhat were the basic results? \nThe following was observed: When carbohydrate was consumed last, lower levels of insulin were secreted (24.8% lower than the meal with carbohydrates first), which would suggest a smaller spike in glucose. There was no significant difference between eating carbohydrates last and having all nutrients together. Consistent with this, glucose levels were 53.8% and 40.4% lower in the meal with carbohydrates last compared to having carbohydrates first and all nutrients together, respectively. The GLP-1 levels were higher in people who ate carbohydrates last. Glucagon levels were not significantly different between the three meal conditions. \nHow did the researchers interpret the results? \nThe researchers concluded:\"In this study, we demonstrated that the temporal sequence of carbohydrate ingestion during a meal has significant impact on postprandial glucose regulation. These findings confirm and extend results from our previous pilot study; the inclusion of a third nutrient order condition, a sandwich, had intermediate effects on glucose excursions compared with carbohydrates last versus carbohydrates first.\" \nConclusion \nThis crossover trial investigated the optimal time to eat carbohydrates during a meal to lower blood glucose levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. It generally found that consuming carbohydrates last was better at lowering glucose levels and reducing insulin secretion when compared to having carbohydrates first or all nutrients together. \nThe researchers say that suggesting people with type 2 diabetes follow this advice may be an effective behavioural strategy to improve glucose levels after meals. \nAlthough the findings are interesting, there are a few points to note: \nMost importantly, this study was very small. A study using a much larger sample could give completely different results. Ideally the findings would need to be verified in a well-designed trial that randomised a much larger number of people with type 2 diabetes to consume their nutrients in a specific order, and then followed their response to this pattern over a longer period of time. \nThere may be other factors affecting individual responses to the order of carbohydrate consumption \u2013 for example, the level of physical activity was not standardised across all participants. Again this is another factor that would need to be controlled in a larger trial. \nWe are all different \u2013 and saving carbohydrates until the end of a meal may only be effective for some people with type 2 diabetes, and not others. \nThe findings cannot be applied to people with type 1 diabetes. \nThese findings may pave the way for further research through larger trials, which in time may result in a change in the current recommendations for meal consumption for people with type 2 diabetes. \nHowever, they have no current implications. For now, a healthy diet and keeping active will help you manage your blood sugar level. This will also help you control your weight and generally feel better.

Criteria \nOnly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the NIH mission , all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Overall Impact \nReviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Scored Review Criteria \nReviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Has the applicant proposed a scientific agenda that maximizes data and specimen collection from the cohort to advance understanding of HIV infection and disease? Investigator(s) Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Have the PD(s)/PI(s) provided evidence that they and the collaborators, and other researchers have previous experience and success in conducting these types of studies? Innovation Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Do the PD(s)/PI(s) suggest novel approaches to accelerate and simplify the studies proposed? Approach Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Environment Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? Additional Review Criteria \nAs applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Protections for Human Subjects For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects . Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research . Vertebrate Animals The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals.

A new article by Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues examines the multifaceted nature of effective preparedness and the particular role that biomedical research plays. Specifically, the article examines three approaches to pandemic preparedness: pathogen-specific work, platform-based technologies, and prototype-pathogen efforts. Using vaccine development as an example, the authors conclude that a combination of all three approaches will lead to the best preparedness for future pandemics. The article appears online today in The Journal of the American Medical Association . \nPathogen-specific research prioritizes diseases known to be dangerous, such as Ebola. Countermeasures to prevent and fight the disease are developed ahead of time and can be rapidly deployed if those diseases emerge. However, this approach relies on the ability to correctly identify future threats and cannot prepare for unexpected outbreaks, such as HIV, SARS, or Zika. \nWith platform-based approaches, researchers focus on developing customizable techniques, such as those involving nanoparticles or viral vectors. In the event of a pandemic, genetic material can be incorporated into the platform to protect recipients against a specific disease. \nThe \u201cprototype pathogen\u201d approach can shorten the time needed to create vaccines using platform-based methods. This approach involves studying the characteristics of categories or families of pathogens, such as the family of viruses that contains dengue, West Nile and Zika viruses, and developing vaccines for the category ahead of time. When a disease from a specific category causes an outbreak, these vaccines can be customized if necessary to the specific pathogen within that family, and researchers have a greater chance of quickly deploying an effective vaccine, the authors write. \nDespite their adaptability, platform-based and prototype-pathogen approaches do not necessarily yield fully-developed vaccines, treatments or diagnostics, which can lead to a slower response than if pathogen-specific countermeasures had been developed. The best way forward is a combination of all three approaches, the authors write. By investing in research to develop specific countermeasures for known threats and utilizing platform-based and prototype-pathogen approaches to allow for adaptation when unexpected outbreaks arise, global public health organizations can best prepare to combat future disease outbreaks. \nARTICLE: H Marston et al .

Habana Avenue, Suite 201, Tampa, FL 33614, USA. Abstract \nAtherosclerosis is a complex process with multiple mechanisms and factors contributing to its initiation and progression. Detection and quantification of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores with electron beam tomography has been shown to correlate with obstructive and nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Pathogen-triggered calcification could play a role in CAD. Recent reports suggest that infectious blood nanobacteria (NB) emerge to be such a trigger. So far, minimal or no reversal of atherosclerosis has been claimed by therapies with iv ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA), antibiotics, or other regimens, and therapies for atherosclerosis remain non-curative. We have now combined EDTA with antibiotic tetracycline (comET), an in vitro proven nanobacteriocidal treatment, and tested comET therapy in patients with documented CAD. Three hypotheses were probed: (1) Are NB present in patients with CAD?; (2) Does treatment with comET affect blood NB antigen and serology?; (3) Does a comET decrease CAC scores? One hundred patients with stable CAD and positive CAC scores were enrolled into a 4 month study of comET therapy. ComET therapy is composed of (1) Nutraceutical Powder (Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, Niacin, Folic Acid, Selenium, EDTA, l-Arginine, l-Lysine, l-Ornithine, Bromelain, Trypsin, CoQ10, Grapeseed Extract, Hawthorn Berry, Papain) 5cm(3) taken orally every evening; (2) Tetracycline HCl 500mg taken orally every evening; (3) EDTA 1500mg taken in a rectal suppository base every evening. CAC scoring was repeated at 4 months and serum samples were analyzed for NB antigen and serology at baseline, 2 and 4 months. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, liver function, C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and lipids were analyzed at baseline and 4 months. Seventy-seven patients completed the study and all patients were positive for NB serology, antigen or both. Responders (n = 44; 57%) had significant decreases in total CAC scores (P = 0.001), the average decrease being 14%. Non-responders (n = 33; 44%) had no change or had increases in CAC scores. Angina was decreased or ablated in 16 of 19 patients (84%). Lipid profiles improved to non-atherogenic direction significantly (P = 0.001), a remarkable finding in a patient group where 86% were on continuous statin medication already before the trial. No adverse physiologic effects were seen in renal, hepatic, or hematopoetic systems. In conclusion, CAC scores decreased during ComET therapy trial in most CAD patients inferring regression of calcified coronary artery plaque volume. The patients tolerated the therapy well and their angina and lipid profiles improved. Further treatment trials for long term therapy with matched controls are warranted.

Early Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis Is Key", "text": "En espa\u00f1ol \nArthritis is an inflammation Swelling and irritation caused by the body\u2019s protective response to injury. of the joints. There are over 100 types of arthritis. While their symptoms can be similar, their underlying causes vary. Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It\u2019s far more common than rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is caused by wear and tear on your joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system The system that protects your body from microscopic threats. \u2014which normally helps protect your body from infection and disease\u2014starts attacking your joint tissues. \nAnyone can get rheumatoid arthritis. The disease most often begins in middle age or later. But it can occur at any age. Even children sometimes get a similar form of arthritis. Some types of arthritis affect one joint at a time, but rheumatoid arthritis can affect your whole body. \nIt\u2019s important to get the correct diagnosis because each form of arthritis needs to be treated differently. To diagnose rheumatoid arthritis, doctors use medical history, physical exams, X-rays, and lab tests. There\u2019s no single test for the disease. It\u2019s not easy to diagnose. \n\u201cThe joint swelling in rheumatoid arthritis is squishy, and very different from the hard bony enlargement of the finger joints that is sometime present in osteoarthritis,\u201d explains Dr. Michael M. Ward, who oversees rheumatoid arthritis research at NIH. \nYour joints may appear red and feel warm. Pain and stiffness may be worse after you wake up or have been resting for a long time. Over time, your immune system damages the tough, flexible tissue (cartilage) that lines joints. This damage can be severe and deform your joints. \nScientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes rheumatoid arthritis. It\u2019s likely a combination of genetics and environmental triggers, such as tobacco smoke or viruses. Hormones Substances produced in one part of the body to signal another part to react a certain way. may also play a role. More women are diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis than men. The disease sometimes improves during pregnancy or flares up after pregnancy. \nWhat scientists do know is that the damage is caused by the immune system gone awry. The body\u2019s defense system mistakenly attacks the membrane that lines joints, such as in the wrists, fingers, and toes. Joints in the neck, knees, hips, ankles, and elsewhere can also be affected. \n\u201cThe immune system is supposed to be something that does good things for you,\u201d says Dr. M. Kristen Demoruelle, an NIH-funded arthritis expert at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to help you fight infections. But in rheumatoid arthritis\u2014for reasons that we don\u2019t yet understand\u2014the immune system gets confused and then starts to attack your joints instead.\u201d \nThere\u2019s no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. But there are effective treatments. Treatment can relieve pain, reduce joint stiffness and swelling, and prevent further joint damage. \nResearch advances have improved patient outcomes in the past 10 to 20 years. Doctors no longer wait to start treating a person with rheumatoid arthritis. Now, they know to begin treatment right away\u2014before joint damage worsens. Early detection is very important to increase the chance that treatment is successful. \n\u201cIf we can get you into low disease activity by 6 months and remission [no signs of the disease] by 1 year, we\u2019ve got an incredibly good chance of the disease having a very minimal impact on your life,\u201d says Dr. Vivian P. Bykerk, an NIH-funded arthritis researcher at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. \nThere are many different classes of drugs available. Many of the drugs, like NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and steroids, work by reducing inflammation. Such drugs may be used in combination with others that have been shown to slow joint destruction. \nNIH scientists helped develop a new class of drug for rheumatoid arthritis called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. These drugs work by suppressing the body\u2019s immune response. Several years ago, the first drug in this new class was approved by FDA for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Researchers continue to investigate new types of drugs and drug combinations. \n\u201cWe really have to rely on our experience. We consider the combination of signs, symptoms, and blood tests to choose the right treatment,\u201d Bykerk explains. Once treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is underway, patients need frequent checkups. Doctors may need to try and adjust different drugs or drug combinations to find the best fit for each person. Treatments are usually required for the long term to maintain control of the disease. For some people, symptoms go on for years, even a lifetime. Sometimes after months of mild disease, symptoms can flare up again. \nBykerk also works on an NIH-supported team of scientists who are searching for more effective treatment approaches. The team analyzes joint tissue and blood samples from people with rheumatoid arthritis to better understand the genes and proteins that trigger and drive the disease. The researchers aim to learn why some people respond differently to different treatments. They also hope to one day be able to tailor treatments to each person. Other studies are exploring how long people need to be treated once the disease is under control to prevent it from returning. \nRheumatoid arthritis can affect virtually every area of your life, from work to relationships. If you have rheumatoid arthritis, there are many things you can do to help maintain your lifestyle and keep a positive outlook. Exercise helps keep your muscles healthy and strong, preserve joint mobility, and maintain flexibility. Rest helps to reduce joint inflammation, pain, and fatigue. Ask your doctor how best to balance exercise and rest for your situation. \nNew research advances continue to help improve quality of life for people with rheumatoid arthritis. Talk with your doctor about how to treat your joint pain and stiffness so that you can lead a full, active, and independent life.

Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the opioid crisis in the United States and the Federal response. From the start of his Administration, President Trump has made addressing the opioid epidemic a top priority, and at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) we share the President\u2019s commitment to bringing an end to this crisis, which is exacting a toll on individuals, families, and communities across the country. The Department has made the crisis a top clinical priority and is committed to using our full expertise and resources to combat the epidemic. \nOver the past 15 years, communities across our Nation have been devastated by increasing prescription and illicit opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose. According the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\u2019s National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), in 2016, over 11 million Americans misused prescription opioids, nearly 1 million used heroin, and 2.1 million had an opioid use disorder due to prescription opioids or heroin. Over the past decade, the U.S. has experienced significant increases in rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), hepatitis C infections, and opioid-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Most alarming are the continued increases in overdose deaths, especially the rapid increase since 2013 in deaths involving illicitly made fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids. Since 2000, more than 300,000 Americans have died of an opioid overdose. Preliminary data for 2016 indicate at least 64,000 drug overdose deaths, the highest number ever recorded in the U.S. Too many of our citizens are being robbed of their God-given potential in the prime of their life. \nThe opioid epidemic in the U.S. is fundamentally tied to two primary issues. The first issue was the significant rise in opioid analgesic prescriptions that began in the mid-to-late 1990s. Not only did the volume of opioids prescribed increase, but well-intentioned healthcare providers began to prescribe opioids to treat pain in ways that we now know are high-risk and have been associated with opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose, such as prescribing at high doses and for longer durations. The second issue is a lack of health system and healthcare provider capacity to identify and engage individuals, and provide them with high-quality, evidence-based opioid addiction treatment, in particular the full spectrum of medication-assisted treatment (MAT). It is well-documented that the majority of people with opioid addiction in the U.S. do not receive treatment, and even among those who do, many do not receive evidence-based care. Accounting for these factors is paramount to the development of a successful strategy to combat the opioid crisis. Further, there is a need for more rigorous research to better understand how existing programs or policies might be contributing to or mitigating the opioid epidemic. \nIn April 2017, HHS outlined its five-point Opioid Strategy, which provides the overarching framework to leverage the expertise and resources of HHS agencies in a strategic and coordinated manner. The comprehensive, evidence-based Opioid Strategy aims to: Improve access to prevention, treatment, and recovery support services to prevent the health, social, and economic consequences associated with opioid addiction and to enable individuals to achieve long-term recovery; Target the availability and distribution of overdose-reversing drugs to ensure the broad provision of these drugs to people likely to experience or respond to an overdose, with a particular focus on targeting high-risk populations; Strengthen public health data reporting and collection to improve the timeliness and specificity of data and to inform a real-time public health response as the epidemic evolves; Support cutting-edge research that advances our understanding of pain and addiction, leads to the development of new treatments, and identifies effective public health interventions to reduce opioid-related health harms; and Advance the practice of pain management to enable access to high-quality, evidence- based pain care that reduces the burden of pain for individuals, families, and society while also reducing the inappropriate use of opioids and opioid-related harms. \nTo date, the Department has taken significant steps to advance the goals of our Opioid Strategy. While this statement does not represent an exhaustive list of HHS activities underway, SAMHSA, CDC, NIH, and FDA bring unique expertise and capabilities that enable HHS to take a comprehensive, complementary, and flexible approach to the opioid crisis. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) \nAs HHS\u2019s lead agency for behavioral health, SAMHSA\u2019s core mission is to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America\u2019s communities. SAMHSA supports a portfolio of activities that address all five prongs of HHS\u2019s Opioid Strategy. Improving Access to Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Support Services \nSAMHSA administers the Opioid State Targeted Response (STR) grants, a two-year program authorized by the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255). By providing $485 million to states and U.S. territories in fiscal year (FY) 2017, this program allows states to focus on areas of greatest need, including increasing access to treatment, reducing unmet treatment need, and reducing opioid overdose related deaths through the provision of the full range of prevention, treatment and recovery services for opioid use disorder. The President\u2019s Budget requests $500 million for this program in FY 2018, the full level authorized by Congress. \nThe Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SABG), first authorized in 1992, is a vital source of funding for states that accounts for approximately 32 percent of total state substance abuse agency funding. For many people seeking to recover from opioid addiction, this public funding represents the only support for treatment. In addition, the block grant\u2019s flexible structure enables states to use the funds to address pressing challenges within their communities, such as the opioid crisis. \nSAMHSA also has several initiatives aimed specifically at advancing the utilization of MAT for opioid use disorder, which is proven effective but is highly underutilized. SAMHSA\u2019s Medication Assisted Treatment for Prescription Drug and Opioid Addiction (MAT-PDOA) program expands MAT access by providing grants to states with the highest rates of treatment admissions for opioid addiction. Twenty-two states are currently funded by MAT-PDOA, and in September 2017, SAMHSA awarded $35 million dollars over three years in additional MAT-PDOA grants to six states. \nSAMHSA also provides critical funding for MAT for specific high-risk and vulnerable populations, such as those involved with the criminal justice system and pregnant and postpartum women. SAMHSA\u2019s criminal justice grantees can use up to 20 percent of their grant awards for the purchase of FDA-approved medications for treatment of opioid and alcohol addiction. Since 2013, SAMHSA has seen a steady increase in the number of drug courts integrating MAT into their programs with 57 percent of active programs currently integrating MAT. \nUnder SAMHSA\u2019s Pregnant and Postpartum Women\u2019s (PPW) program, which serves women with opioid or other substance use disorders who are pregnant and/or newly parenting, grantees are encouraged to ensure access to MAT for opioid addiction, which has been shown to improve birth outcomes. Last month SAMHSA awarded $9.8 million over three years for new State Pilot PPW grants authorized by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA, P.L. 114-198) and $49 million over five years in new PPW service grants to support the recovery of pregnant and postpartum women struggling with substance abuse, including opioid addiction. \nA well-documented challenge to improving access to opioid use disorder treatment is a lack of providers who can provide MAT. SAMHSA supports a number of training initiatives to increase the number of qualified healthcare providers who can provide treatment for opioid addiction. In the last four years, more than 62,000 medical professionals have participated in online or in-person trainings on MAT for opioid addiction through SAMHSA\u2019s Provider\u2019s Clinical Support System (PCSS)-MAT. This program is a national training and clinical mentoring project that provides mentoring of newly trained physicians by experienced specialists, maintains a library of evidence- based practice materials, and offers at no cost to the trainee the required DATA 2000 waiver training to enable providers to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid addiction treatment. \nSAMHSA regulates opioid treatment programs (OTPs), which dispense methadone and may also dispense and prescribe buprenorphine and administer extended-release naltrexone. In coordination with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and states, territories, and the District of Columbia, SAMHSA reviews new and renewal applications for OTPs through an accreditation process that ensures programs have sound risk management practices in place and are using evidence-based treatments. SAMHSA also oversees physicians, nurse practitioners (NPs), and physician assistants\u2019 (PAs) ability to prescribe buprenorphine in office-based outpatient treatment settings. Last year, SAMHSA published a final rule which allows certain qualified physicians who have obtained a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for up to 100 patients for at least a year, to now acquire a waiver to treat up to 275 patients. The regulation provides that these licensed physicians can become eligible for the patient limit of 275 either by being board certified in Addiction Medicine or Addiction Psychiatry or by practicing in a qualified practice setting. \nThese physicians are required to complete a SAMHSA reporting form each year to ensure that physicians prescribing at the new, higher level are in compliance with safe and appropriate prescribing practices. As of September 19th, 3,573 physicians have obtained a waiver to treat up to 275 patients. Most recently, SAMHSA began processing waivers to allow NPs and PAs to prescribe buprenorphine in accordance with the requirements of CARA. As of September 19th, 2,756 NPs and 773 PAs have received a waiver. \nSAMHSA also promotes recovery through targeted grants, such as last month\u2019s award of $4.6 million over three years in Building Communities of Recovery program grants, created by CARA. The purpose of this program is to mobilize resources within and outside of the recovery community to increase the availability and quality of long-term recovery supports for individuals in or seeking recovery from addiction. These grants are intended to support the development, enhancement, expansion, and delivery of recovery support services as well as promotion of and education about recovery. Programs will be principally governed by people in recovery from substance abuse and addiction who reflect the community served. Targeting Overdose-Reversing Drugs \nSAMHSA has been a leader in efforts to reduce overdose deaths by increasing, through funding and technical assistance, the availability and use of naloxone to reverse overdose. SAMHSA\u2019s \u201cOpioid Overdose Prevention Toolkit,\u201d first released in 2013, is one of SAMHSA\u2019s most downloaded resources. The Toolkit provides information on risks for opioid overdose, recognition of overdose, and how to provide emergency care in an overdose situation. The Toolkit is intended for community members, first responders, prescribers, people who have recovered from an opioid overdose and family members, as well as communities and local governments. \nSAMHSA provides a number of funding streams that can be used to expand access to naloxone. States are able to use Opioid STR funds to purchase and distribute naloxone, and some states are also using a portion of their SABG funds for opioid overdose prevention activities. \nSAMHSA is currently providing $11 million per year in Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose Related Deaths to 12 states. These grants are also being used to train first responders on emergency medical care to be rendered in an overdose situation and how to administer naloxone as well as how to purchase and distribute naloxone. \nIn September 2017, SAMHSA awarded funding for grants authorized by CARA, including almost $46 million over five years to grantees in 22 states to provide resources to first responders and treatment providers who work directly with the populations at highest risk for opioid overdose. Strengthening Public Health Data and Reporting \nSAMHSA\u2019s National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) provides key national and state level data on a variety of substance use and mental health topics, including opioid misuse. NSDUH is a vital part of the surveillance effort related to opioids, and the data from NSDUH has been used to track historical and emerging trends in opioid misuse, including geographic and demographic variability. \nSAMHSA also works collaboratively with other agencies to better understand the epidemic through sharing of data and assessing the implications of that data and develops publications based on NSDUH and other national surveys and data. Examples of recent SAMHSA publications include: Trends in the Use of Methadone, Buprenorphine, and Extended-release Naltrexone at Substance Abuse Treatment Facilities; Trends in Average Days\u2019 Supply of Opioid Medications in Medicaid and Commercial Insurance; and Opioid Prescribing Trends for Adolescents and Young Adults with Commercial Insurance and Medicaid. Supporting Cutting-Edge Research \nSAMHSA is building on existing partnerships with the NIH to improve the research to practice pipeline and is committed to promoting evidence-based practices and service delivery models. The newly formed Office of the Chief Medical Officer and the National Mental Health and Substance Use Policy Laboratory, which were authorized through the 21st Century Cures Act to promote evidence-based practices and service delivery models, will be pivotal to these efforts. Additionally, the National Mental Health and Substance Use Policy Laboratory will assist in addressing the opioid crisis through its evaluation of models that would benefit from further development and through expanding, replicating, or scaling evidence-based practices across wider areas as we seek to increase access to and delivery of the best treatment services for opioid use disorders across America. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \nAs the Nation\u2019s public health and prevention agency, CDC\u2019s expertise and leadership is essential in reversing the opioid epidemic. It was CDC that first identified the increase in opioid overdose deaths in 2004, and since then the agency has applied its scientific expertise to track the epidemic and develop evidence-based prevention strategies. Through various programs and initiatives, CDC supports all five parts of the Secretary\u2019s Opioid Strategy: Strengthening Public Health Data and Reporting \nTimely, high-quality data help both public health officials and law enforcement understand the extent of the problem and how it is evolving, develop interventions, focus resources where they are needed most, and evaluate the success of prevention and response efforts. Understanding that data is crucial, CDC is helping states build capacity to monitor the scope of the epidemic and better focus their prevention activities through several programs and activities. \nCDC\u2019s Overdose Prevention in States (OPIS) provides resources and scientific support to 45 states and Washington, D.C. through three programs. The first two programs, Prescription Drug Overdose: Prevention for States (PfS) and Data-Driven Prevention Initiative (DDPI), provide states with the resources, tools and technical expertise to execute and evaluate prevention strategies to improve safe prescribing practices and prevent prescription drug misuse, abuse, and overdose. States use their funding to advance prevention in four key areas: 1) Enhancing Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) and leveraging them as public health tools; 2) Improving health system and insurer practices for safer opioid prescribing; 3) Evaluating policies that may have an impact on the opioid epidemic (e.g.. naloxone distribution and Good Samaritan laws); and 4) Quickly responding to emerging and critical needs. \nCDC\u2019s Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance (ESOOS) program, the third program under OPIS, funds 32 states and Washington, D.C. Started in 2016, ESOOS strives to improve the timeliness of reporting both fatal and non-fatal opioid overdoses and associated risk factors in order to inform public health responses within and across states. What is particularly unique and innovative about this program is the use of emergency department and emergency medical services (EMS) data to track and analyze morbidity data. ESOOS uses this data to establish an early warning system to detect sharp increases (e.g. potential outbreaks) or decreases (e.g. successful intervention efforts) in non-fatal overdoses. \nCDC has made progress in improving the timeliness of data reporting and is now releasing quarterly and, as of August 2017, monthly provisional counts of overall drug and opioid overdose deaths in the Vital Statistics Rapid Release (VSRR) series. CDC also relies on its existing infrastructure to monitor rates of new cases of HIV and viral hepatitis in many states. CDC is working with Coroners and Medical examiners to improve both comprehensive toxicology efforts that help with the detection of fentanyl analogs and the capacity for mortality surveillance by identifying ways to help strengthen case management systems to report data more easily and quickly. While CDC has made progress, improvements are needed to build infrastructure (medical examiners, coroners, toxicological testing, additional electronic reporting, etc.). A stronger disease detection system will identify potential problems sooner. \nCDC is also tracking opioid use among pregnant and reproductive-aged women and its impact on the mother and newborn as a part of the Treating for Two: Safer Medication Use in Pregnancy initiative. Pilot programs are underway to obtain state-level estimates of NAS to better understand hospital readmissions and long-term adverse outcomes among infants identified with NAS. \nIn addition to providing funding and technical assistance, CDC conducts epidemiological investigations (Epi-Aids) in states, providing on the ground assistance during a public health crisis. Between 2012 and 2015, Massachusetts experienced a surge of opioid- related deaths, from 698 to 1,747, with over 74 percent of these deaths involving fentanyl. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) called on CDC to help investigate the extent to which illicitly-manufactured fentanyl (IMF) contributed to the surge in opioid-related overdose deaths. CDC worked closely with the MDPH, SAMHSA, and DEA to determine whether IMF mixed with or sold as heroin was the primary cause of the surge of deaths and found that 82 percent of fentanyl-related overdose deaths were suspected to have involved IMF. \nTo stop the surge, CDC recommended that the MDPH train physicians, treatment providers, and law enforcement on overdose prevention, screen at-risk people for heroin or fentanyl use, and expand access to naloxone. CDC also recommended outreach to those who experienced an opioid overdose, had a history of substance abuse, or were accessing health programs for active users to link them to treatment and educate them on the dangers of fentanyl. \nOften, CDC\u2019s work in states leads to further, national initiatives. The 2015 response to an HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) outbreak in Scott County, Indiana, led to a CDC analysis which identified over 220 U.S. communities that could be especially vulnerable to HIV and HCV outbreaks among persons who inject opioid drugs. One of those states, Tennessee, used CDC\u2019s assessment to do further analysis of the state\u2019s vulnerabilities. As a result, Tennessee is working to direct its HIV and viral hepatitis resources where they are most needed. \nIn addition to working with states, a partnership across sectors is necessary. CDC has been working on initiatives with law enforcement agencies, like the DEA, to strengthen public health and law enforcement collaboration on the federal level. \nIn addition, the Heroin Response Strategy (HRS), funded by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and deployed in eight High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs), covering 20 states, links public health and public safety at the state level. CDC works with the HIDTA directors to sharpen strategic directions, ensure proper coordination and training, support the 20 public health analysts embedded in the program, and improve performance measurement. There is currently a shortage of evidence to guide public health-law enforcement integrated community response, thus as part of the HRS, CDC is launching eight pilot projects across the 20-state initiative to build scientific evidence about what works. Advancing the Practice of Pain Management \nAnother of CDC\u2019s key focus areas is supplying health care providers with the tools and resources necessary to advance the practice of pain management. In March 2016, CDC released the Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, which was developed to help primary care doctors provide safer, more effective care for patients with chronic pain outside of active cancer, palliative, and end-of-life care. The Guideline provides 12 voluntary recommendations for prescribing opioids for patients 18 and older, in primary care settings, based on the most current scientific evidence. This helps patients and physicians better understand and assess risks and benefits of opioid therapy and determine the optimal method for each patient to manage their pain. \nCDC has created a number of resources for health care providers to make the Guideline easy to understand and access. Earlier this year, CDC launched the first in a series of interactive, online trainings which provide sample scenarios, feedback, and resources for each recommendation. CDC is also capitalizing on technology to help disseminate the Guideline through the development of an Opioid Guideline Application (mobile app) which contains all of the Guideline recommendations, a morphine milligram equivalent (MME) calculator, and an interactive interviewing feature to help providers prescribe with confidence. Other materials developed for providers, pharmacists, and patients include graphics, fact sheets, posters, and podcasts, all available on CDC\u2019s website. \nCDC is also committed to educating consumers about the risks of opioids and the importance of discussing safer, more effective pain management options with their healthcare providers. In September 2017, CDC released the Rx Awareness communications campaign to increase awareness about the risks of prescription opioids and deter inappropriate use. The campaign features real-life accounts of individuals living in recovery, and those who have lost someone to an overdose. CDC is running digital, radio, and out-of-home campaign ads for 14 weeks in select states (KY, MA, NM, and OH) with broader release anticipated in 22 additional OPIS funded states. Improving Access to Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Support Services \nCDC brings scientific expertise and leverages existing relationships with health systems to link patients who need MAT to the appropriate care. As part of the OPIS effort, several states funded under the PfS program are supporting health system approaches to link patients to treatment and recovery services. For example, states are building systems that facilitate better linkages to treatment, emergency room peer patient navigators, and data dashboards to identify hot spots for treatment needs. \nAdditionally, CDC is conducting an epidemiologic study to assess what type of MAT (methadone maintenance; buprenorphine; naltrexone) or counseling and other non- medication interventions is most effective, and which contextual, provider, and individual factors influence implementation, prevent relapse, and improve patient wellbeing over a two-year period. This study can help identify who may benefit from which type of treatment to ensure individuals receive the treatment best suited to their needs. Targeting Overdose-Reversing Drugs \nCDC is currently working with SAMHSA to evaluate its Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose-Related Deaths program with the goals of describing and understanding the scope and impact of naloxone education and distribution efforts in high-need communities and to identify barriers and potential solutions to increase program effectiveness. Additionally, states funded under OPIS are evaluating practices to improve the distribution and use of overdose reversing drugs and Good Samaritan laws (policies that protect the victim and the bystander from drug possession charges). States utilize CDC data to identify communities experiencing a significant increase in opioid overdose deaths, which helps to inform both the targeted distribution of naloxone and the training of community members, EMS, and law enforcement on naloxone administration. Supporting Cutting-Edge Research \nTo better understand the epidemic, identify risk and protective factors, and determine effective interventions, CDC also funds innovative research to prevent misuse and abuse. One CDC funded project at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, is working to assess and compare changes in prescribing behaviors when providers are presented with electronic alerts on potential misuse or abuse of opioids. This research will inform efforts to improve clinical decision-making. In addition, CDC funds academic research centers to conduct translational research in order to better understand how to get information into the hands of practitioners. For example, the Johns Hopkins Injury Control Research Center (ICRC) is working to reduce injured patients' risk for opioid misuse through mobile health technology while the West Virginia University (WVU) ICRC was instrumental in the development and implementation of a pilot take- home program for naloxone in rural communities. There were at least 25 overdose reversals in the first nine months of the program in 16 counties. As part of a rapid response project using CDC funds, the WVU ICRC distributed 8,250 naloxone kits to first response agencies and take-home naloxone programs throughout the state in the first half of 2017. National Institutes of Health (NIH) \nNIH is the lead HHS agency providing support for cutting-edge research on pain and opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose. Drug addiction is a complex neurological condition, driven by many biological, environmental, social, and developmental factors. Continued research will be key to understanding the crisis and informing future efforts. Pain is an equally complex condition. To this end, NIH supports a range of activities to advance research on pain and addiction. Supporting Cutting-Edge Research \nBecause the most effective way to end opioid misuse and addiction is to prevent it from beginning, NIH is supporting innovative research to better understand what makes an individual vulnerable to opioid misuse. For example, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the U.S., will help build an evidence base to draw on for a future of precision medicine approaches to prevent opioid addiction. \nWith the goal of bringing scientific solutions to the opioid crisis, NIH is exploring ways to promote 1) new, innovative medications and technologies to treat opioid addiction and improve overdose prevention and reversal interventions, and 2) safe, effective, non- addictive strategies to manage pain. In April 2017, NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., met with research and development leaders from the world\u2019s leading biopharmaceutical companies to discuss new ways for government and industry to work together to address the opioid crisis. NIH continued meetings throughout the summer. As part of these ongoing discussions, NIH participated in a recent meeting with Pharmaceutical CEOs convened by Governor Christie, co-chair of the President\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, in Trenton, New Jersey, on September 18th. Some advances NIH is working to promote may occur rapidly, such as improved formulations of existing medications, longer-acting overdose- reversal drugs, and repurposing of treatments approved for other conditions. Others may take longer, such as novel overdose-reversal medications and identifying biomarkers to measure pain in patients. Our goal for these activities is to cut in half the time needed to develop new safe and effective therapeutics to help end the opioid crisis. \nNIH will continue to build upon breakthroughs in the treatment of opioid addiction and the reversal of opioid overdose and find ways to advance the development of new products. For example, buprenorphine, one of the three FDA-approved options for MAT treatment, was developed through a partnership between NIH and industry. The intramural program of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) conducted the early clinical studies on buprenorphine and then later partnered with industry to develop user- friendly and abuse deterrent formulations. In addition, a NIH public-private partnership helped to develop the only FDA-approved intranasal naloxone product to reverse opioid overdose, an invaluable tool to those on the front lines combating the opioid crisis. In 2013, NIDA funded a biopharmaceutical company for clinical studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties \u2013 how much and how rapidly the naloxone is absorbed \u2013 of an intranasal formulation. In 2015, the intranasal naloxone was approved by the FDA. With knowledge gained from neuroscience advances, NIH researchers now seek ways to turn the tide in the opioid crisis through a wider range of formulations of existing and new medications, as well as innovative strategies to treat opioid use disorder and prevent and reverse overdose. \nNIH is also working toward preventing the most serious health consequences for infants born with NAS. Currently, NIH research aims to determine more precise dosing of buprenorphine in pregnant women, and to reduce the time to develop new treatments. \nNIH is also launching a new effort on opioid use in pregnancy, to study the effects of medically supervised opioid withdrawal on mother and newborn, and better understand the genetic or epigenetic factors associated with opioid use on neonatal outcomes. NIH will also develop and pilot a common study protocol to generate evidence for best practices in treating newborns with NAS, through a partnership between the NIH Neonatal Research Network and the new IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network. \nNIH researchers are also working to build an understanding of how to effectively integrate prevention and treatment services within healthcare and community systems. For example, NIH is studying strategies to improve the implementation of MAT for people with opioid use disorder in the criminal justice system. This research aims to optimize implementation of evidence-based screening, assessment, and treatment services by juvenile justice agencies and improve coordination with community healthcare providers in a way that promotes long-term recovery from opioid addiction in real-world settings. Advance the Practice of Pain Management \nOur mission to end the opioid crisis will not be successful until we can provide patients with better options for the treatment of pain, which touches 25 million Americans every day. NIH funds a broad range of research on pain, from basic research into the molecular, genetic, and bio-behavioral basis of chronic pain to large-scale clinical studies of potential treatments. NIH funded basic research has identified a myriad of potential targets for future non-addictive therapies. Pathological pain and addiction are classic disorders of brain circuits and the neurotechnologies emanating from the US BRAIN Initiative enable scientists to explore these circuits to advance both diagnostics and therapeutics. Research efforts to understand and alleviate pain depend on better objective measures of the pain experience for patients. To address this, NIH also supports development of resources to advance the research agenda. One example is the Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). PROMIS provides a rigorously tested patient-reported outcome measurement tool to measure pain, fatigue, physical functioning, and emotional well-being. \nNIH works with Federal partners across government to carry out cutting-edge research on pain. Through the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee, NIH developed the Federal Pain Research Strategy, a long-term strategic plan to coordinate and advance the federal research agenda on pain. The Strategy\u2019s research priorities include prevention of acute and chronic pain, management of acute pain, transition from acute to chronic pain, and understanding the disparities that influence pain and pain management. \nOngoing projects that already are advancing the goals laid out in the Strategy include the NIH-DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory program, which recently announced $81 million in research funding to implement cost-effective large-scale clinical research in military and veteran healthcare delivery organizations, focusing on non-pharmacologic approaches to pain management and other comorbid conditions. \nBeyond research activities, NIH is engaged in efforts to advance the HHS Opioid Strategy pillar of advancing the practice of pain management. NIH worked with HHS and agencies across government to develop the National Pain Strategy, the government\u2019s first broad-ranging effort to improve how pain is perceived, assessed, and treated, which highlights the need for evidence based treatments. NIH is actively working with other Departments and Agencies and external stakeholders to implement the Strategy. In addition, NIH is supporting Centers of Excellence for Pain Education that act as hubs for the development, evaluation, and distribution of pain management curriculum resources for medical, dental, nursing, pharmacy and other schools to enhance education about pain and pain care. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \nFDA, the Agency responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices, is focusing on three broad areas to help address the opioid crisis: lowering overall exposure to opioid drugs and, in turn, reducing the number of new cases of addiction; enabling more opportunities for those currently addicted to opioid drugs to seek MAT that can help them recover; and helping expedite the development of progressively more-effective abuse deterrent formulations of opioid drugs, and better still, non-opioid alternatives for the treatment of pain. To advance these goals, FDA, earlier this year, established an Opioid Policy Steering Committee that brings together the Agency\u2019s most senior career leaders to explore and develop additional tools and strategies to confront the opioid crisis. Support Cutting-Edge Research \nAbuse Deterrent Formulations (ADF): FDA\u2019s emphasis on assessing the full public health effects of opioids is reflected in the Agency\u2019s ongoing work to support the development of forms of prescription opioids that deter abuse. The Agency strongly supports a transition from the current market dominated by conventional opioids to one in which the majority of opioids have meaningful abuse-deterrent properties. In support of this transition and potential future actions against products without these properties, FDA is focusing its efforts on determining how effective the current abuse deterrent products are in the real world. To assist this effort, the Agency recently gathered independent experts for a scientific workshop to discuss both the existing science and what else is needed to properly assess the impact of opioid formulations with abuse-deterrent properties on misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death. Separately, FDA is working to support generic forms of abuse deterrent opioids by issuing final guidance on their development, in recognition of the important role generic drugs play in the United States. \nAlternatives to Opioids for Pain: FDA strongly supports the development of new treatment options for patients in pain, especially treatments that do not have the same addictive features of traditional opioids. To advance both non-addictive and non- pharmacologic treatments for pain, FDA commits to using all of the Agency\u2019s authorities. This includes programs such as the Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations that are intended to facilitate development and to expedite review of products that, for example, are intended to treat a serious condition for which there is an unmet medical need. As a part of these efforts, FDA is meeting with innovators who are pursuing non- opioid alternatives for the treatment of pain to provide guidance on their individual products. Agency steps also include a more careful consideration of non-drug alternatives for pain, such as medical devices that can deliver more localized analgesia. FDA is considering how to more closely fit medical device alternatives into a comprehensive approach to the development of treatments for pain. \nWe know that developing non-opioid and non-addictive pain medicines is challenging for many reasons; therefore, FDA is interested in progressing the entire field of pain drug development. To address the issues related to the trials needed for approval, FDA has participated in a public-private-partnership (PPP) under the Critical Path initiative, the Analgesic Clinical Trial Translation, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION). The ACTTION PPP is a collaboration among a broad spectrum of national and international groups aimed at advancing the science in this area, including academia, FDA and other government agencies, pharmaceutical and device companies, professional organizations, and patient advocacy groups. \nAt the same time as we are prioritizing work on non-opioid and non-abusable pain medicines, FDA is also taking new steps to help facilitate the development of medications that can help patients with addiction recover as well as overdose reversal drugs, such as naloxone. FDA is laying the groundwork for naloxone to be available more broadly and is supporting research aimed at encouraging the potential development of over the counter naloxone products. Advance the Practice of Pain Management \nChanges in Prescribing: To reduce the rate of new opioid addiction, we need to decrease overall exposure to opioids. For many people, that first prescription will be for an immediate release (IR) formulation of the drug. Some people will go on to become addicted and abuse longer-acting formulations that can deliver higher doses, especially when manipulated. Some of these people will eventually move onto street drugs, such as heroin, which are increasingly the low-cost alternative. We know that this route of addiction correlates with exposure. A certain percentage of patients exposed to opioids will go on to develop an addiction to the drugs. One approach to reducing the rate of new addiction, then, is to reduce exposure to prescription opioid drugs. To accomplish this, we need to explore ways to use our regulatory authorities to influence how opioids are prescribed to make sure that only appropriately indicated patients are prescribed opioids, and that the prescriptions are written for durations and doses that properly match the clinical reason for which the drug is being prescribed in the first place. We are exploring whether FDA should take additional steps to make sure that general prescribing and the number of opioid doses that an individual patient can be dispensed, is more closely tailored to the medical indication. Among other steps, FDA is soliciting public input on these questions in the form of a public docket that was established the week of September 25. \nExpanded Education through Modification of Opioid REMS, and Changes to the Education Blueprint: Since 2012, FDA has required manufacturers of extended-release long-acting opioids to make available educational materials through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). We know that most of the exposure to opioids is not from extended-release or long-acting formulations, but from IR formulations like hydrocodone and acetaminophen or oxycodone and acetaminophen combinations. In fact, about 90 percent of all opioid prescriptions in the United States are written for IR formulations of these drugs. IR opioid products serve as the gateway for patients and non-patients who may continue to use or misuse these products, which could lead to new addiction. Given this fact, we need to advance policies that rationalize the prescribing and dispensing of IR opioid drugs. \nAs one step, FDA has determined that a REMS to support education is also necessary for the prescribing of IR opioid products. This regulatory tool is needed to ensure that the benefits of these drugs continue to outweigh the risks of adverse outcomes (addiction, overdose, and death) resulting from inappropriate prescribing, abuse, and misuse, and that providers are properly informed about suitable prescribing and the risks and benefits associated with opioid drugs. FDA has announced its intention to update the existing REMS on extended-release/long-acting opioid analgesics, and for the first time, extend these same regulatory requirements (including prescriber training) to the manufacturers of IR opioid analgesic products. FDA is currently implementing that plan. We have also announced plans to revise the Blueprint used to create education materials to include broader information on pain management, including the principles of acute and chronic pain management; non-pharmacologic treatments for pain; and pharmacologic treatments for pain (both non-opioid analgesic and opioid analgesic). To start this process, the relevant letters, detailing the new requirements, were recently sent to sponsors that manufacture the IR drugs. \nIn addition to the efforts described above, HHS continues to engage with a broad range of stakeholders \u2013 state and local governments, addiction specialists, medical, nursing, dental, and pharmacy providers, community and faith-based organizations, private-sector partners, community organizations, and law enforcement partners \u2013 to share best practices, build collaborations, and identify barriers that could prevent success. We are committed to this fight and will continue to advance a multi-pronged strategy, never forgetting that behind all the statistics are individuals, families, and communities who are being torn apart each day. Our guiding vision must be to improve the lives of all Americans who have been touched by this crisis. That will be the true measure of our success. \nLastly, HHS, through the President\u2019s FY 2018 budget, has requested more than $800 million to continue to support the Department\u2019s critical opioid investments.

The specific causes of death included in the analysis varied somewhat among the different countries. In one country, all deaths were included, whereas deaths were limited to those from nonaccidental causes in seven countries. In 10 other countries, deaths were limited to deaths from nonexternal causes, which excludes not only accidental deaths in particular, but also deaths that were unrelated to factors outside the body, such as suicide, drowning, or assault. The definition of \u201cheat wave\u201d can vary widely, depending on how hot the days are and how long the episode lasts. A new study found that heat waves by any definition   a significant increase in deaths. Image: \u00a9 Stefano Guidi/Shutterstock. \nEach country had collected data over different timespans, sometimes over more than two decades. To account for different regional norms in temperature, the researchers defined heat waves based on percentiles (90th, 92.5th, 95th, or 97.5th) of average daily temperatures for each community. To examine how the length of a heat wave may have affected mortality, they looked at abnormally high temperatures lasting at least 2 days, at least 3 days, or at least 4 days. For instance, one theoretical heat wave modeled in the analysis was defined as 3 consecutive days with an average daily temperature in the top 10% of all average daily temperatures for that community. \nOverall, the researchers estimated that heat waves by any definition   a significant increase in deaths across each country. Heat waves involving higher temperatures were generally associated with greater increases in mortality risk. In contrast with previous research, 4 however, the researchers found that the number of days that a heat wave persisted did not modify the heat wave\u2013related mortality risk. \nEstimates of heat wave effects varied widely from city to city. For instance, a 2-day heat wave at the 95th percentile of average daily temperature was associated with a more-than-doubled risk of death from a nonexternal cause in Falesti, Moldova. In contrast, Phetchabun, Thailand, saw a slight decrease in nonaccidental mortality during heat waves of the same duration and intensity. Guo explains that this difference might be a result of personal strategies to keep cool, borne of adaptation to frequent hot weather. \nIn general, significant increases in mortality began on the first day of a heat wave and typically lasted 3\u20134 days after the culmination of the event\u2014even longer in some countries. For instance, people may have had a heart attack during a heat wave but died several days later. Although high temperatures can trigger immediate deaths from causes such as cardiovascular disease, they may also lead to subtle alterations in bodily functions such as increased blood pressure or heart rate, which could compound existing health problems, explains Guo. \nThe researchers concluded that the increases in deaths could be attributed largely to daily high temperatures. Guo says these findings suggest that reducing health risks associated with hot days may be better achieved using high-temperature warning systems, which are based solely on temperature, as opposed to heat wave warning systems, which can vary depending on how \u201cheat wave\u201d is defined. \nBrooke Anderson, an assistant professor of environmental epidemiology at Colorado State University, calls the new findings novel. \u201cKnowing that some of the health effects for heat waves persist after the initial event has very important implications for public health,\u201d she says. Such information could help communities make decisions about how long to keep cooling centers open or whether to perform door-to-door checks on vulnerable individuals, says Anderson, who was not involved in the study. \nCountries including Italy, Moldova, and Vietnam saw the largest increases in deaths associated with heat waves. The researchers are not sure why some countries experienced greater mortality risk during hot weather than others experienced. The researchers surmise that low rates of air conditioning use in Italy and Moldova and low levels of socioeconomic development in Moldova and Vietnam could be important reasons, although they did not investigate community-level factors that could account for differences in mortality risk. \n\u201cFuture studies could dig into important factors that may be driving lower or higher mortality risk in different cities,\u201d says Anderson. Some of these factors could include large populations of sick or elderly people, community preparedness measures, cultural habits, lifestyle patterns   the population typically spends more time indoors or outdoors), and housing types. \nLindsey Konkel is a New Jersey\u2013based journalist who reports on science, health, and the environment.

This protocol has been published on the SYRCLE website ( Wassenaar and Legler 2015 ) as \u201cThe effects of early-life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals on obesity development in rodents: a systematic review\u201d (2015) (also see Supplemental Material). Search Strategy \nArticles published before September 21, 2015 were identifiedin MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. Following the SYRCLE methodology ( Leenaars et al. 2012 ), a comprehensive search strategy was developed and included the search components \u201cendocrine disrupting chemicals,\u201d \u201cobesity,\u201d and \u201crodents\u201d (see Excel Table S1). The initial search component for \u201cendocrine disrupting chemicals\u201d was broader than BPA only because this design may allow investigation of other EDCs in the future. To detect all rodent studies, animal search filters ( de Vries et al. 2014 ; Hooijmans et al. 2010b ) were modified to only include rodents. In addition, the reference lists of the included articles and those of relevant reviews were screened manually for potentially relevant new articles. Selection of Papers \nStudy selection consisted of two screening phases. The first selection was based on title and abstract screening, and the second selection was based on a full-text screening. One reviewer (P.W.) conducted the two screening phases, and in case of doubt, a second reviewer (J.L.) was consulted. \nStudies were selected for full-text screening when they met the inclusion criteria. In case of doubt, articles were also analyzed based on their full text. Studies were included in this systematic review when they met all of the following criteria: a ) original full paper that presented unique data; b ) exposure to BPA; c ) obesity-related article or at least one of the outcome measures was examined (body weight, fat pad weights, triglyceride levels, FFA levels, or leptin levels); d ) experimental rodent study; e ) perinatal exposure via maternal or direct pup exposure [during gestation and/or lactation up to postnatal day (PND) 21]. Studies were excluded if they met one of the following criteria: a ) not an original paper; b ) exposure to a chemical other than BPA; c ) no disease or outcome of interest (no obesity-related outcome); d ) not a rodent study; e ) not perinatal exposure (paternal exposure, exposure after PND21, and measurements in unborn fetuses were excluded); f ) outcomes not measured in F1 generation; g ) unhealthy or genetically altered rodents (data measured after ovariectomy were considered unhealthy and were not extracted); h ) outcomes were measured after diet was altered to high-fat diet during follow-up. In addition, selection was restricted to English-language articles. Study Characteristics and Data Extraction \nThe following characteristics were extracted from the included studies: bibliographic data (authors, year of publication, journal of publication, conflict of interest section, and funding source), animal model characteristics (species, strain, and sex), exposure characteristics (chemical, life stage and duration, dose, frequency, and route of exposure), study design characteristics (number of animals in experimental and control groups, duration of follow-up, and timing of data collection), and outcome measures [types of outcomes measured: body weight, fat (pad) weights, triglyceride levels, FFA levels and/or leptin levels, and compartment of outcome measured]. From each study, we considered each analysis of a specific outcome measure with a specific dose and/or sex as a separate individual comparison. In addition, analyses in different fat pads (even when derived from the same animal) and analyses with different time windows of exposure were considered as separate comparisons. Consequently, multiple comparisons could have been included from one study. One reviewer extracted the data (P.W.), and in case of doubt, a second reviewer was consulted (J.L.). \nAll outcome data were collected for each individual comparison as the mean, standard deviation (SD), and number of animals per group. When raw data or group averages with standard error (SE) and number of animals per group were reported, the mean and SD values were recalculated. When the group size was reported as a range, the smallest number of animals was used for the meta-analysis in the interest of conservative estimates. In cases where data were presented graphically and not as text or in tables, data were extracted in pixels using a digital screen ruler. In cases of missing or unclear data, including SDs or SEs that were not provided or that could not be extracted from figures owing to many crossing lines, the authors were contacted via email for the original data. If no author contact details were available, or if no response was obtained from the authors within three weeks after repeated contact, the data were omitted from analysis. When outcomes of comparisons were measured at different time points, the time point with greatest efficacy was used (i.e., the time point with the strongest association with the outcome). The time point of greatest efficacy was selected over the other time point(s) when the absolute difference between the means of the exposure and control groups divided by the sum of the SDs was the highest. By using the absolute difference, the direction of the effect was not considered in the selection of the time point of greatest efficacy. Risk of Bias and Methodological Quality Assessment \nTo assess the risk of bias in the included studies, SYRCLE\u2019s Risk of Bias (RoB) tool was used; this tool is specifically designed for animal studies ( Hooijmans et al. 2014 ). The RoB tool consists of ten questions which can be used to detect selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias in the included studies (see Figure 2 for a complete list of the ten items included in the RoB tool). The items in the RoB tool were scored with \u201cyes,\u201d indicating low risk of bias; \u201cno,\u201d indicating high risk of bias; or \u201cunclear,\u201d indicating that the item was not reported, and therefore, the risk of bias was unknown. For the scoring of these items, we applied the same signaling questions as those proposed by Hooijmans et al. ( 2014 ). Briefly, Item 1 of the RoB tool, sequence generation, was scored with \u201cyes\u201d when authors clearly described a random component in the sequence generation, such as the use of a computer random number generator. A \u201cno\u201d score was provided when a nonrandom approach was applied, such as allocation by judgement or preference. Item 2 of the RoB tool, baseline similarities, was analyzed based on age and body weight. Baseline similarities were scored with \u201cyes\u201d when the age of directly exposed animals was reported, when directly exposed animals were randomly distributed across exposure and control groups according to body weight, or when both of these occurred. Item 3 focused on allocation concealment and was scored based on the applied method to conceal the allocation sequence. Methods such as sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes were considered adequate; however, allocation based on animal number, for example, was not considered adequate because the investigator might have been able to foresee the assignments. Item 4, random housing, was scored with \u201cyes\u201d when animals were randomly housed during the experiment. Blinding of caregivers, Item 5, focused on the blinding of caregivers to knowledge about which intervention each animal received. Appropriate blinding included identical housing for the exposure and control groups, whereas differences in housing were considered inappropriate blinding. Item 6, random outcome assessment, focused on the method applied to select animals for outcome assessment, and Item 7 focused on the blinding of the outcome assessor   similar assessment methods were applied to both the exposure and the control groups). Item 8, incomplete outcome data, focused on whether all animals were included in the analyses and whether reasons for dropouts were clearly explained. Item 9, selective outcome reporting, focused on whether results of all outcomes mentioned in the methods section were reported in the results section and vice versa. Items 6\u20139 were only analyzed for the following outcome measures: body weight, fat (pad) weights, triglyceride levels, FFA levels, and leptin levels. In addition, in Item 10, other potential sources of bias were scored, including risks of additional additives that were added during dosing and design-specific risks. \nIn addition to the RoB assessment, four items were added to check the methodological quality. Two of these items specifically focused on potential litter effects. In theory, potential litter effects could have been covered under Item 10 of the RoB tool; however, we decided to report these items separately because these are key issues for perinatal exposure studies. One of the items focused on whether the litter or the individual offspring were used as statistical unit, and the other item focused on whether effects on litter size were observed after exposure to BPA compared with control conditions. These items were translated into the following two questions: \u201cWas intralitter correlation controlled for by using the litter as statistical unit (instead of offspring)?\u201d and \u201cWas the study free of potential intralitter correlation caused by effects on litter size?\u201d These items were scored with \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cunclear.\u201d In addition, we included two overall study quality indicators to acquire additional lower-tier information on the reporting quality of the studies. Because animal studies are known for their poor reporting quality in comparison with randomized clinical trials, it is likely that many items of the RoB tool are not reported or are poorly reported ( Hooijmans et al. 2014 ). The two overall study quality indicators scored whether any randomization was reported for any level of the experiment and whether any blinding was reported for any level of the experiment. These items were scored \u201cyes\u201d when reported and \u201cno\u201d when not reported. One reviewer (P.W.) conducted the RoB and methodological quality assessment, and in case of doubt, a second reviewer (J.L.) was consulted. The results of the RoB tool and the additional methodological quality items were used in the sensitivity analyses and in the confidence rating as described below. Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis \nMeta-analyses were performed using Review Manager (RevMan) v5.3 (The Cochrane Community) if at least five studies reported on a specific outcome measure, which was the case for all outcomes studied. No criteria were set for the number of comparisons that had to be included. Mean differences (MDs; the mean of the experimental group minus the mean of the control group) were calculated for outcome measures that reported data on the same scale, or when all data could be converted to the same scale, including body weight and leptin. If data were not reported on the same scale and could not be converted, standardized mean differences (SMDs; the mean of the experimental group minus the mean of the control group divided by the pooled SD of the two groups) were calculated, including for fat weight, triglycerides, and FFA. In the meta-analyses, random effect models were used to account for the anticipated heterogeneity for all outcome measures. Positive SMDs and MDs indicated an increase in the outcome measures after BPA exposure, whereas negative SMD and MDs indicated a decrease in the outcome measure. Heterogeneity was assessed using I 2 and was represented on a scale ranging from 0% to 100%, where \u226450% was considered as no serious heterogeneity between studies, 50\u201375% was considered as moderate heterogeneity, and >75% was considered as substantial heterogeneity ( NTP 2015 ). The significance level of the meta-analyses was set at p <0.05. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the influence of variables and to explore possible causes of heterogeneity. Subgroups were predefined in the protocol, and subgroup analyses were only performed when at least three studies could be included per subgroup. No criteria were set for the number of comparisons that had to be included. In some cases, subgroups that contained fewer than three studies, such as specific strains or routes of exposure, were combined in a subgroup called \u201cOthers\u201d to generate a subgroup with three or more studies. The following subgroup variables were assessed for all outcome measures: animal species (rats or mice), strains, sex (male or female), time window of exposure (perinatal, prenatal, or postnatal), dosage of treatment (below or above the RfD of 50 \u03bcg/kg/d), route of exposure (gavage, oral, diet, drinking water, or subcutaneous injections), timing of outcome measurement (before or after PND 21, the normal weaning period), and frequency of exposure (daily or constant exposure, for example, via constant availability of BPA in drinking water or diet). Some studies provided birth weight data for mixed sexes, whereas at later time points, sex-specific body weight data were provided. We included only the sex-specific data because they are considered to be more informative (i.e., they provide information on sex-specific effects as well as information on later time points). Furthermore, for the outcome measures triglyceride, FFA, and leptin, effects on different compartments were analyzed if at least three studies could be included (e.g., levels in serum/plasma and hepatic tissue). For the outcome measure fat weight, subgroup analyses were conducted to analyze the effects on different fat pads. All subgroup differences were analyzed with a test for subgroup differences in RevMan. To correct for multiple testing, the significance levels of the subgroup analyses were adjusted to p <0.01. For fat weight, where multiple fat pads from individual animals were often analyzed, no additional correction was applied in the analysis to account for nonindependency. The results are presented as SMDs or MDs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), heterogeneity value I 2 and number of studies with number of comparisons in parentheses [i.e., n =number\u2009of\u2009studies\u2009(number\u2009of\u2009comparisons)]. \nPotential publication bias was assessed by visually inspecting funnel plots for asymmetry for outcome measures containing at least 10 studies. In addition, lag time for \u201cnegative\u201d studies and conflict of interest sections with funding sources were investigated. A publication lag time for \u201cnegative\u201d studies may be present because \u201cpositive\u201d studies tend to be published earlier ( NTP 2015 ). Therefore, we visually inspected the effect sizes on year of publication to identify whether a lag time for \u201cnegative\u201d studies was likely to be present. Furthermore, publication bias could be present when studies are uniformly sponsored by industry or by nongovernmental organizations and/or when authors have a conflict of interest ( NTP 2015 ). We characterized publication bias as \u201cundetected\u201d or as \u201cstrongly suspected\u201d (i.e., when clear asymmetry was observed in funnel plots, when clear lag time was observed for negative studies, when the majority of studies had conflict of interest issues, or for combinations of any or all of these) in line with the assessment of the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT; NTP 2015 ). \nTo evaluate the robustness of our results, we performed a series of three sensitivity analyses. First, to assess the impact of the latest time point on interpreting study results and possible transient effects, we selected the latest measured time point instead of the time point with the greatest efficacy. Second, a sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding studies of potential high bias and poor reporting quality, that is to say, by excluding studies that did not receive a single \u201cyes\u201d score on Items 1\u201312 of the risk of bias and methodological quality indicators. A third sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding studies that were not free of potential litter effects. The excluded studies were selected based on a \u201cno\u201d answer to either of the two included methodological quality items (Items 13\u201314). Confidence Rating \nThe quality of evidence of the outcomes of the systematic review was rated using the confidence rating methodology described by OHAT ( NTP 2015 ). The OHAT confidence rating methodology is primarily based on the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, in which four confidence ratings are used: high, moderate, low, and very low. The quality of evidence was rated for each outcome measure separately, in which initial confidence was rated based on the presence of four key study design features: a ) controlled exposure; b ) exposure before outcome development; c ) outcome assessment on the individual level; and d ) inclusion of a comparison group. Experimental animal studies usually have all of these features and therefore, the included studies received an initial rating of \u201chigh confidence.\u201d Subsequently, five factors were assessed that could reduce the confidence rating (risk of bias, unexplained inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias), followed by four factors that could increase the confidence rating (large magnitude of effect, dose response, plausible confounding, and consistency across study designs). \nBriefly, for downgrading confidence based on risk of bias, the results of the SYRCLE RoB tool were considered as well as the results of the sensitivity analyses. We downgraded this item based on the RoB tool when predominantly \u201cno\u201d and \u201cunclear\u201d scores were provided for the included studies and/or when the direction of the overall effect changed after sensitivity analyses. Unexplained inconsistency was addressed by considering similarity of point estimates, overlap of confidence intervals between studies, and statistical heterogeneity (i.e., I 2 >50% is moderate heterogeneity and >75% is substantial heterogeneity). Indirectness was rated based on multiple aspects: the relevance of the animal models to the outcome of concern for humans (i.e., effects on body weight, fat weight, triglycerides, FFA, and leptin), the directness of the end point to the primary health outcome (i.e., obesity), and the relevance of the route of exposure. Duration of treatment and time window between exposure and outcome measurement were not rated under indirectness because defining a \u201ctoo-short\u201d time window is difficult. In line with OHAT recommendations, studies conducted with rats or mice were considered relevant for humans and were not downgraded on this specific aspect of indirectness (i.e., the first aspect). Imprecision was assessed based on the 95% confidence intervals (i.e., overlap with null or not). Publication bias was assessed similarly to the manner described above, as \u201cundetected\u201d or \u201cstrongly suspected\u201d using funnel plots or when there were other indications of potential publication bias (i.e., lag time for \u201cnegative\u201d studies or conflicts of interest). The factor \u201clarge effect magnitude\u201d for upgrading confidence is difficult to assess because relatively \u201csmall\u201d effects can have major public health impacts on a population basis. Furthermore, when using SMDs, the estimates are not directly related to actual physiological differences; therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the magnitude of effect estimates has any relevance to public health. Therefore, no threshold effect was set, and consequently, this factor was not used to upgrade confidence within this study. Dose\u2013response effects were assessed by visually inspecting the effect sizes of individual study estimates. Indications of dose\u2013response effects needed to be present consistently both within and across studies to be upgraded. The factor \u201cplausible confounding\u201d primarily applies to observational studies ( NTP 2015 ). Because we considered animal studies in the present study, we decided not to use this factor to upgrade confidence. Within this study, confidence was upgraded for \u201cconsistency across study designs\u201d when results were consistent across multiple animal models (i.e., rats and mice) and across multiple strains based on p -values for subgroup differences. Because only rodents were considered in this systematic review, we rated \u201cconsistency across species\u201d only as a half confidence level and not as a full confidence level. Additionally, in line with the OHAT confidence rating methodology, we did not downgrade twice for what was essentially the same limitation, for example, whether wide confidence intervals resulted from unexplained inconsistency or from imprecision. In addition, in the case that two domains were borderline for downgrading, the body of evidence was downgraded once for a single factor to account for both partial concerns. Results Study Selection and Characteristics \nFigure 1 shows the flow chart of the study selection process. Using the comprehensive search strategies, 2,535 unique articles were identified from PubMed and EMBASE. After title and abstract screening, 122 articles were selected for full-text screening. Of these 122 publications, 47 publications were included in the review. In 18 of the 122 articles, data reporting was unclear, and the authors were contacted (see Excel Table S2). For 4 of these articles, data were provided; for 14 articles, no reply was received. Of these 14 articles, 9 articles were fully excluded because body weight data were unclear and no information was presented on other outcome measures relevant to this review. For the remaining 5 studies, we were able to extract data of sufficient quality for outcomes other than body weight. In addition, after screening the reference lists of the included articles and of relevant reviews, an additional 14 articles were included, resulting in a total of 61 articles (see Excel Table S3 for the characteristics of all included studies). Figure 1: Flow chart of study selection process. \nOf the 61 included studies, 55 reported effects of BPA on body weight, 13 on fat weight, eight on triglyceride levels, seven on FFA levels, and eight on leptin levels. These outcome measures included 190, 117, 17, 18, and 34 independent comparisons, respectively, totaling 376 independent comparisons. FFA were mostly examined in blood (71% of the studies reported serum/plasma concentrations) but were also examined in hepatic (29%) or fat tissue (14%). The same is true for triglycerides (75% of the studies reported serum/plasma concentrations, and 38% reported hepatic tissue concentrations). Leptin levels were only reported in blood (100% in serum/plasma). The outcome fat weight was examined for several fat pads including the intraabdominal fat pads: retroperitoneal (23% of the studies), (peri)gonadal (62%), (peri)renal (38%), and mesenteric fat (31%). In addition, mammary gland fat (8%), subcutaneous fat (15%), brown adipose tissue (BAT; 31%), and total fat weight (31%) were reported. In all BPA exposure studies, outcomes were measured between PND0 and PND540, and the exposure dose ranged from 0.2 \u03bcg/kg/d to 655 mg/kg/d. Risk of Bias and Methodological Quality Assessments \nThe main observation from the risk of bias and methodological quality assessments is the many \u201cunclear\u201d scores, indicating that most items were not sufficiently reported, resulting in an unknown risk of bias ( Figure 2 ). The individual scores of the RoB tool and the methodological quality indicators of each included study are provided (see Excel Table S4). With respect to selection bias ( Figure 2 ; Q1\u2013Q3), the sequence generation process was reported in only three studies (5%; Q1). Although many studies mentioned that the animals were randomly assigned to exposure groups, the randomization method was unclear. As a result, the risk of bias on Item 1 could not be judged for many articles. Baseline similarities were reported more often (49%; Q2), whereas information about allocation concealment was not reported at all (Q3). None of the articles reported on random housing and blinding of caregivers ( Figure 2 ; Q4 and Q5, respectively). As a result, performance bias could not be judged. Regarding detection bias ( Figure 2 ; Q6 and Q7), none of the studies described a random outcome assessment for relevant outcome measures (Q6). In addition, the outcome assessor was reported to have been blinded in six studies (10%; Q7). Incomplete outcome data were adequately addressed in six studies (10%; Q8), resulting in a low risk of attrition bias for these studies. With respect to reporting bias (Q9), a high risk was identified for two studies (3%). All other studies were scored with an unclear risk of bias on this item. Additionally, other potential sources of bias were identified in four articles (7%; Q10). For two studies this included additional additives during dosing. Rats received 15% sucrose in their drinking water in addition to BPA exposure ( Xu et al. 2011 ) or ten subcutaneous injections of corn oil ( Ichihara et al. 2003 ). In two other studies, animals were delivered by cesarean section ( Howdeshell and vom Saal 2000 ; Nagao et al. 2002 ). Figure 2:. Results of the risk of bias and methodological quality indicators for all included studies. The items in the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) Risk of Bias assessment (Q1\u2013Q10) were scored with \u201cyes\u201d indicating low risk of bias, \u201cno\u201d indicating high risk of bias, or \u201cunclear\u201d indicating that the item was not reported, resulting in an unknown risk of bias ( Hooijmans et al. 2014 ). Q1\u2013Q3 consider selection bias, Q4\u2013Q5 consider performance bias, Q6\u2013Q7 consider detection bias, Q8 considers attrition bias, Q9 considers reporting bias, and Q10 considers other biases. The overall study quality indicators (Q11\u2013Q12) were scored with \u201cyes\u201d when reported or \u201cno\u201d when not reported. The methodological quality indicators focusing on potential intralitter correlation (Q13\u2013Q14) were scored with \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cunclear.\u201d Q, question. Q1: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated and applied?; Q2: Were the groups similar at baseline or were they adjusted for confounders in the analysis?; Q3: Was the allocation to the different groups adequately concealed?; Q4: Were the animals randomly housed during the experiment?; Q5: Were the caregivers and/or investigators blinded from knowledge which intervention each animal received during the experiment?; Q6: Were animals selected at random for outcome assessment?; Q7: Was the outcome assessor blinded?; Q8: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?; Q9: Are reports of the study free of selective outcome reporting?; Q10: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could result in high risk of bias?; Q11: Was it stated that the experiment was randomized at any level?; Q12: Was it stated that the experiment was blinded at any level?; Q13: Was intralitter correlation controlled for by using the litter as statistical unit (instead of offspring)?; Q14: Was the study free of potential intralitter correlation caused by effects on litter size? \nIn addition to risk of bias, four study quality indicators were used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. In 64% of the studies, randomization at any level of the experiment was reported ( Figure 2 ; Q11), whereas blinding was reported in only 21% of the studies (Q12). Assessment of litter effects revealed that the litter was used as a statistical unit in 51% of the studies, the offspring was used as a statistical unit in 30% of the studies, and in 15% of the studies, it was unclear whether litter or offspring was used as statistical unit (Q13). In addition, three studies received both a \u201cyes\u201d and a \u201cno\u201d score (5%). Two of these studies used the litter as a statistical unit for measurements before PND21 and the offspring as a statistical unit for measurements after PND21. The third study used the litter as a statistical unit for one outcome measure, but the offspring was used as a statistical unit for other relevant outcome measures (see Excel Table S4). Effects were observed on litter size after exposure to BPA in only three studies (5%; Q14). Effects of BPA on Obesity-Related Outcomes Body weight. \nOut of 55 studies, a total of 190 comparisons investigating the effects of BPA on body weight could be included in the meta-analysis. These studies reported body weight in grams; therefore, MDs were calculated for the effects of BPA on body weight. Early-life exposure to BPA was associated with significantly lower body weight based on the overall summary estimate [MD=\u22120.22 (95% CI: \u22120.37, \u22120.06); Table 2 ]. There was substantial heterogeneity among the studies ( I 2 =86%; Table 2 ). A forest plot shows the individual effect estimates for the 190 comparisons of BPA exposure with body weight (see Excel Figure S1). Subgroup analysis showed that heterogeneity was very high for all estimates (i.e., I 2 >75%) with the exception of the estimate for some strains. Associations did not vary between mice and rats ( p -value\u2009for\u2009subgroup\u2009differences=0.69), although they varied across strains ( Table 2 ). Nonsignificant positive associations were estimated for three mouse strains, a significant positive association was estimated for Wistar rats (with substantial heterogeneity, I 2 =92%), and null or negative associations were estimated for all other strains, including a significant negative association for F344 rats ( I 2 =35%; p -value\u2009for\u2009subgroup differences<0.0001). When based on females only, a significant negative association was estimated [MD=\u22120.41 (95% CI: \u22120.65, \u22120.17)] in contrast with a null summary estimate for males [MD=\u22120.05 (95% CI: \u22120.27, 0.17); p -value\u2009for\u2009subgroup differences=0.03]. Associations varied across time window of exposure, with null estimates for perinatal and prenatal exposure, and a significant negative association was estimated for postnatal exposure ( p -value\u2009for\u2009subgroup\u2009differences=0.04). Associations with body weight were in opposite directions when based on studies with daily exposure [e.g., via gavage or subcutaneous injection; MD=\u22120.34 (95% CI: \u22120.50, \u22120.18)] versus constant exposure via diet or drinking water [MD=0.99 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.61); p -value\u2009for\u2009subgroup\u2009differences=0.0001]. In addition, significant positive associations were estimated for exposure via drinking water, and null or negative associations were estimated for all other exposure routes, including significant negative associations for subcutaneous exposure and exposure via gavage ( p -value\u2009for\u2009subgroup\u2009differences=0.0004). Exposure doses <50 \u03bcg/kg/d were positively associated with body weight [MD=0.16 (95% CI: \u22120.03, 0.36)], whereas exposure doses >50 \u03bcg/kg/d were significantly associated with a lower body weight [MD=\u20130.40 (95% CI: \u22120.72, \u22120.09); p -value\u2009for\u2009subgroup\u2009differences=0.003]. Furthermore, measurements before PND21   significantly lower body weight [MD=\u22120.29 (95% CI: \u22120.40, \u22120.17)], whereas measurements after PND21 were estimated to have a nonsignificant positive association with body weight [MD=0.49 (95% CI: \u22120.12, 1.11); p -value\u2009for\u2009subgroup\u2009differences=0.01].

The centers, to be funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), part of the National Institutes of Health, will share approximately $82 million over five years, pending the availability of funds. \nHealth disparity populations experience a disproportionate burden of preventable diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, along with exposure to substance abuse, violence, and trauma. These populations include racial and ethnic minority groups, underserved rural populations, people of less privileged socioeconomic status, along with groups subject to discrimination who have poorer health outcomes often attributed to being socially disadvantaged. \nThe Centers of Excellence (COE)\u2019s program fosters collaborative research in minority health and health disparities that will identify critical biological, behavioral, environmental, sociocultural and health systems factors to aid in developing optimal interventions that will reduce targeted health disparities. \n\u201cWe need strong collaborations and research based upon asking the right questions in specific areas. The Centers of Excellence are poised to emphasize scientific inquiry that will promote health equity,\u201d said NIMHD Director Dr. Eliseo J. P\u00e9rez-Stable. \nThe Centers of Excellence (COEs) program will help: Support innovative multi- and transdisciplinary research to promote minority health and reduce health disparities Strengthen exemplary research training and education activities to support the development of well-trained researchers, including those from minority and health disparity populations Increase the number of individuals from minority and other health disparity populations participating in research activities Provide support for engaging minority and other health disparity communities in effective and sustainable activities aimed at improving the health of their communities \nEach NIMHD COE will have a specific unifying focus that will directly and demonstrably impact minority health and health disparities in that topic area. The focus of each COE will revolve around at least one of the NIH-designated health disparity populations or a subpopulation within a health disparity population. Additionally, the COEs may include specific disease areas that disproportionately affect disparity populations and contribute substantially to health outcomes, and/or prevention topics that cut across health conditions and populations. \nThe NIMHD COEs program, established by the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-525), has played a vital role in realizing NIMHD\u2019s mission to support research in minority health and health disparities, promote the training of a diverse research workforce, disseminate research findings, and foster innovative collaborations and partnerships. Each center includes community organizations, academic institutions, clinicians, and health care systems, as well as state and local public health agencies. The research programs translate community needs into practice at local clinics, churches, and community centers. \nThe 12 COE grantees and their areas of focus are: \nLeveraging Bio-Cultural Mechanisms to Maximize the Impact of Multi-Level Preventable Disease Interventions with Southwest Populations Flavio Marsiglia, Ph.D. 2U54MD002316-11 \nResearchers will study potentially modifiable youth behaviors, such as physical activity, quality of diet, family functioning, acculturation, and substance use, that are associated with cardiac and metabolic diseases and substance abuse disorders. Further, they will investigate how protective and risk factors common to various chronic diseases and disorders manifest among racial and ethnic minority populations of the Southwest and will develop culturally appropriate interventions. \nInvolving Communities in Delivering and Disseminating Health Disparity Interventions Ashwini Sehgal, M.D. 2U54MD002265-11 \nResearchers will train lay health advisors to help African American patients control their hypertension.

A new article by Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues examines the multifaceted nature of effective preparedness and the particular role that biomedical research plays. Specifically, the article examines three approaches to pandemic preparedness: pathogen-specific work, platform-based technologies, and prototype-pathogen efforts. Using vaccine development as an example, the authors conclude that a combination of all three approaches will lead to the best preparedness for future pandemics. The article appears online today in The Journal of the American Medical Association . \nPathogen-specific research prioritizes diseases known to be dangerous, such as Ebola. Countermeasures to prevent and fight the disease are developed ahead of time and can be rapidly deployed if those diseases emerge. However, this approach relies on the ability to correctly identify future threats and cannot prepare for unexpected outbreaks, such as HIV, SARS, or Zika. \nWith platform-based approaches, researchers focus on developing customizable techniques, such as those involving nanoparticles or viral vectors. In the event of a pandemic, genetic material can be incorporated into the platform to protect recipients against a specific disease. \nThe \u201cprototype pathogen\u201d approach can shorten the time needed to create vaccines using platform-based methods. This approach involves studying the characteristics of categories or families of pathogens, such as the family of viruses that contains dengue, West Nile and Zika viruses, and developing vaccines for the category ahead of time. When a disease from a specific category causes an outbreak, these vaccines can be customized if necessary to the specific pathogen within that family, and researchers have a greater chance of quickly deploying an effective vaccine, the authors write. \nDespite their adaptability, platform-based and prototype-pathogen approaches do not necessarily yield fully-developed vaccines, treatments or diagnostics, which can lead to a slower response than if pathogen-specific countermeasures had been developed. The best way forward is a combination of all three approaches, the authors write. By investing in research to develop specific countermeasures for known threats and utilizing platform-based and prototype-pathogen approaches to allow for adaptation when unexpected outbreaks arise, global public health organizations can best prepare to combat future disease outbreaks.

Among his many scientific contributions to biomedical research, Dr. Chen is the first to discover that TGF-beta induces Foxp3 gene in naive CD4+ T cells and converts them into regulatory T cells (iTregs, pTregs). The paper describing this finding has been cited for more than 4000 times. He has also demonstrated that TGF\u010f\u0081\u02d8 controls the development of Foxp3+ Tregs in the thymus (tTregs) and has been working to translate the knowledge acquired from basic mechanistic studies into disease prevention and treatment. His lab has recently discovered a way to induce autoantigen-specific regulatory T cells in vivo in experimental models of autoimmunity including EAE, type I diabetes, EAU and rheumatoid arthritis. Most recently, Dr. Chen discovered that D-mannose has a surprising therapeutic effect on experimental diabetes and asthma. Dr. Chen has published more than 100 peer-reviewed articles in internationally prestigious journals including Nature, Nature Medicine, Nature Immunology, Immunity, J. Exp. Med., PNAS, Science Translational Medicine, Cell Stem Cell, etc., and been invited to speak at many international meetings and universities around the world. Dr. Chen has received many honors and awards, including the Scientific Achievement Award from the NIH Asian and Pacific Islander American Organization and the Wang Ying-Lai Memorial Lecturer. He was also a former president of the Society of Chinese Biologists at America (SCBA) Washington-DC-Baltimore Chapter.

Post Submission Materials \nApplicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy . Section V. Application Review Information 1. Criteria \nOnly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the NIH mission , all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. \nFor this particular announcement, note the following: \nDoes the proposal investigate fundamental questions in human neuroscience? While fundamental basic research often generates insights relevant to disorders of the nervous system, this RFA is not intended to generate research that is explicitly disease-therapeutic. \nIf complementary animal studies are proposed, then anticipated or contingent, non-human, experimental components must be adequately described and justified. \nThe BRAIN Initiative invites applications with high levels of innovation, which assumes some degree of risk. Reviewers should evaluate whether a sound rationale has been provided as to why the research approach is the most appropriate, and likely to generate an exceptionally high impact if successful. Although reviewers will consider feasibility, they will not penalize unavoidable risks that are intrinsic to new and innovative approaches. In addition to the review criteria below, reviewers will assess the technical, procedural and ethical aspects specific to invasive studies in human patients, and the strategic plans for addressing functional studies of a specified neural system in the context of patients with neural dysfunctions and invasive device interventions. Because projects are expected to include early-stage research and planning efforts, preliminary data on feasibility are not required, and should be considered within the context of the specific stage of proposed studies. Reviewers will consider feasibility, but will not penalize well-reasoned justifications of new and innovative approaches. \nIn the interest of the possibility of adopting new and developing technologies during the award, when applicants offer anticipated or alternative, newly developed, IDE-approved devices in the research plan, reviewers should assess feasibility, risk and opportunity, along with strategic contingencies. Overall Impact \nReviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Scored Review Criteria \nReviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Does the project investigate high-impact questions in human neuroscience as appropriate for the goals of this FOA and the BRAIN Initiative?

All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. Registration can take 6 weeks or more, so applicants should begin the registration process as soon as possible. The NIH Policy on Late Submission of Grant Applications states that failure to complete registrations in advance of a due date is not a valid reason for a late submission. Dun and Bradstreet Universal Numbering System (DUNS) - All registrations require that applicants be issued a DUNS number. After obtaining a DUNS number, applicants can begin both SAM and eRA Commons registrations. The same DUNS number must be used for all registrations, as well as on the grant application. System for Award Management (SAM) (formerly CCR) \u2013 Applicants must complete and maintain an active registration, which requires renewal at least annually . The renewal process may require as much time as the initial registration. SAM registration includes the assignment of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code for domestic organizations which have not already been assigned a CAGE Code. NATO Commercial and Government Entity (NCAGE) Code \u2013 Foreign organizations must obtain an NCAGE code (in lieu of a CAGE code) in order to register in SAM. eRA Commons - Applicants must have an active DUNS number and SAM registration in order to complete the eRA Commons registration. Organizations can register with the eRA Commons as they are working through their SAM or Grants.gov registration. eRA Commons requires organizations to identify at least one Signing Official (SO) and at least one Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) account in order to submit an application. Grants.gov \u2013 Applicants must have an active DUNS number and SAM registration in order to complete the Grants.gov registration. \nProgram Directors/Principal Investigators (PD(s)/PI(s)) \nAll PD(s)/PI(s) must have an eRA Commons account. PD(s)/PI(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in eRA Commons. If the PD/PI is also the organizational Signing Official, they must have two distinct eRA Commons accounts, one for each role. Obtaining an eRA Commons account can take up to 2 weeks. Eligible Individuals (Program Director/Principal Investigator) \nAny individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) (PD(s)/PI(s)) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support.

The proposed concepts and approaches are expected to be high-risk, high-impact, and disruptive. Extensive preliminary data demonstrating feasibility is an indication that the project is beyond the scope of this FOA. Accordingly, reviewers will emphasize the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge, understanding or practice. Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or analytical and computational models. The proposed early stage development could involve considerable risk that the work may not be successful and applicants should clearly explain the significance of the work to allow the reviewers to determine whether the potential impact justifies these risks \nPreliminary data are not required for applications in response to this FOA. Overall Impact \nReviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Scored Review Criteria \nReviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Has the state-of-the-art been accurately described? Does the proposed early stage development of entirely new or next generation human brain imaging technology represent a significant step forward in noninvasive neuroimaging in healthy persons? Will the proposed goals, if achieved, generate proof-of-concept and adequately prepare the investigators to commence fully developing the proposed breakthrough imaging technology for assessing various brain processes in ways that are currently unachievable in healthy humans? Investigator(s) Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Does the application have highly skilled investigators in all areas of interdisciplinary science and engineering needed to perform early stage development of the proposed breakthrough imaging technology? Innovation Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Is the proposed proof-of-concept development of next generation human brain imaging based on exceptionally innovative, original and/or unconventional concepts? Does the application propose innovative methods and approaches that may be high-risk but will break through technical barriers and significantly improve current capabilities? Approach Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? In light of requirement in this FOA that there be no or minimal preliminary data, are there a conceptual framework and justification for the proposed work? Have the applicants provided an assessment of how the application will advance beyond the state-of-the-art, with an emphasis on the current resolution/timing/performance limits they expect to improve, and how the proposed development will result in a transformative impact in human neuroscience? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Environment Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? Additional Review Criteria \nAs applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Protections for Human Subjects For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects . Inclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research . Vertebrate Animals The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section . Biohazards Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed.

The researchers found that a protein named ZATT can eliminate DPCs with the help of another protein, TDP2. Since DPCs form when individuals receive some types of cancer treatments, understanding how TDP2 and ZATT work together to repair the damage may improve the health outcomes of cancer patients. The findings were published in the journal Science. \nIllustration of a TOP2 DNA-protein cross-link (magenta) bound to DNA. (Photo courtesy of Scott Williams) \nResearchers knew that TDP2 was important for removing DPCs, but they did not know how it was directed to where it needed to work, according to corresponding author Scott Williams, Ph.D., deputy chief of the Genome Integrity and Structural Biology Laboratory at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH. Williams and his team used a multi-pronged approach to identify ZATT as a new contributor to this process and determine how it guides TDP2 to DPCs so they can be repaired. \nTo visualize how these proteins choreograph DPC repair, one must first know how DPCs are created. Matthew Schellenberg, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author on the paper, said when DNA becomes tangled inside of cells, organisms use a protein called topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) to untangle it. \n\"Imagine your DNA is a giant ball of yarn,\" Schellenberg said. \"TOP2 cuts and reties individual threads to disentangle the ball.\" \nSchellenberg explained that TOP2 normally conceals its cut DNA ends within the core of the TOP2 protein that encircles DNA. Doing so ensures the protein can complete the second part of its job, which is rejoining DNA ends. However, chemotherapeutic drugs or environmental chemicals sometimes block the protein\u2019s DNA-retying ability, so that TOP2 remains stuck on DNA. This situation creates a stable TOP2-DPC complex, which leads to the accumulation of severed DNA that kills cells. \nWilliams likened TOP2-DPCs to ticking time bombs for cells. He said these molecular charges are armed by TOP2\u2019s interaction with environmental toxicants, chemical metabolites, tobacco exposures, or DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light. \nHe added that TOP2-DPCs are most potently formed by pharmaceutical drugs that humans exploit to eradicate cancer cells, making TOP2-DPCs double-edged swords. If they are not removed, they trigger cell death. While cancer drugs induce formation of TOP2-DPCs to treat cancer, TOP2-DPC lesions can also be the source of disease, as they can cause rearrangement of an organism\u2019s genome that leads to cancer. For this reason, Williams and his colleagues said it was necessary to learn how DPCs are located and broken down. \n\"In this study, we discovered a new molecular disarmament apparatus for these cell-killing bombs,\" Williams said. \"ZATT is like a bomb sniffing dog, so when it locates its target, it sounds an alarm to mobilize the recruitment of TDP2, which cuts the red wire to disarm these threats.\" \nSchellenberg said chemotherapeutic drugs, such as etoposide, are not the only pharmaceuticals that induce DPCs. Many of the antibiotics that are currently on the market use the same method to damage bacterial DNA. He said this work was part of a larger effort to figure out how researchers can exploit this key vulnerability to improve health. \n\"We\u2019ve discovered how we defend against this potent means of cell killing,\" Schellenberg said. \"It is our hope that this information will enable development of new drugs that target these defenses. By lowering the defenses, we may make drugs that kill cancer cells more effective.\" \nGrant Numbers:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matthew schellenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schellenberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zatt protein", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national institute of environmental health sciences", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "genome integrity and structural biology laboratory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niehs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zatt", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T21:15:59.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d7e9e770c02d15aa6b01c0bd500ff8ff14c109c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS1roRzEu5.0czyUzuDq5bcVhohuBBOJ3QSsBCoZ5y2o.FbyyWdqvdKDxpv01mnZv.Ya7CSIvX4r3VyACa3CK0TFdwvMXTZGU.eYOT5qZRTrw--", "site_full": "www.nlm.nih.gov", "site": "nih.gov", "site_section": "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/rss/techbull.rss", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "NLM Technical Bulletin", "title": "NLM Technical Bulletin, Sep-Oct 2017, Free Online Continuing Education: Discovering TOXNET", "title_full": "NLM Technical Bulletin, Sep-Oct 2017, Free Online Continuing Education: Discovering TOXNET", "published": "2017-10-06T19:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5, "comments": 0, "shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d7e9e770c02d15aa6b01c0bd500ff8ff14c109c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS1roRzEu5.0czyUzuDq5bcVhohuBBOJ3QSsBCoZ5y2o.FbyyWdqvdKDxpv01mnZv.Ya7CSIvX4r3VyACa3CK0TFdwvMXTZGU.eYOT5qZRTrw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T19:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "NLM Technical Bulletin, Sep-Oct 2017, Free Online Continuing Education: Discovering TOXNET", "text": "REMM (Radiation Event Medical Management) Drug Information Portal \nWho should take the class?

Abstract AIM: \nNo association between human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination and numerous diseases has been found. Still, a large number of Danish women are reporting suspected adverse events. Other factors may play a role, and the aim of this study is to examine the association between psychiatric conditions, general practitioner (GP) attendance and indicators of psychological symptoms prior to HPV vaccination and the risk of referral to an HPV center following vaccination. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: \nRegister-based, matched case-control study. Cases were identified from five Danish, regional HPV centers, and health data for cases and controls were obtained from national registries. PARTICIPANTS: \nCases were defined as women referred to an HPV center between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015 (n=1,496). Each case was matched with five controls on age, region and time of first vaccine registration. The total study population consisted of 8,976 women. RESULTS: \nOverall, women above 18 years who had been referred to an HPV center were more likely to have used psychiatric medication (odds ratio [OR]: 1.88 [95% CI 1.48-2.40]) or to have been hospitalized because of a psychiatric disorder within 5 years prior to the first vaccine registration (OR: 2.13 [95% CI 1.59-2.86]). Specifically, referred women were more likely to have used antipsychotics, antidepressants, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication or anxiolytics, and to have been hospitalized for affective disorders or anxiety, but not to have been hospitalized for schizoid, ADHD or eating disorders. In addition, they were more likely to have had talk therapy or psychometric test performed prior to vaccination (OR: 1.72 [95% CI 0.1.35-2.18] and OR: 1.67 [95% CI 1.30-2.13], respectively). Referred women of all ages had higher use of GP before vaccination. Population attributable fraction analyses indicated that psychiatric medication, hospitalization due to a psychiatric disorder and use of talk therapy, or psychometric test \"explained\" 13%, 10%, 12% and 11% of the referrals, respectively. Results did not change substantially when adjusted for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: \nWomen referred to HPV centers because of suspected adverse events after vaccination more often had preexisting psychiatric conditions, psychological symptoms or frequent GP attendance prior to HPV vaccination.

NLM Tech Bull. 2017 Sep-Oct;(418):e8. 2017 October 06 [posted] \nBeginning with the implementation of Resource Description & Access (RDA) in April 2013 as the NLM cataloging guidelines, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) ceased adding the \"General Material Designation\" (GMD) to titles in our catalog. The GMD was a bracketed addition to the title that indicated the format for non-textual material. In the MARC 21 format, the GMD is recorded in the 245 $h. Example 1 Title: Cerebrovascular diseases extra [electronic resource]. \"electronic resource\" is the GMD. MARC view: 245 00 $a Cerebrovascular diseases extra $h [electronic resource]. \nExample 2 Title: Active euthanasia [videorecording] : the introduction of the concept into Western medical thought / by W. Bruce Fye ; Health Communications Network, Medical University of South Carolina. \"videorecording\" is the GMD. MARC view: 245 10 $a Active euthanasia $h [videorecording] : $b the introduction of the concept into Western medical thought / $c by W. Bruce Fye ; Health Communications Network, Medical University of South Carolina. \nCurrent cataloging practice adds three fields to the record to replace the former GMD: Content Type (MARC 21 field 336), Media Type (MARC 21 field 337), and Carrier Type (MARC 21 field 338). These allow for more granular description of the format. To provide more consistent retrieval for users and make future data conversion simpler, NLM has decided to convert all the existing GMDs in the database to the equivalent 33X fields and remove the GMDs from the records. Because of the number of records involved, this project will be done over a period of time between Fall 2017 and Winter 2018. The 33X fields will be added to records first, based on the existing GMD and other data in the record. Additionally, appropriate 33X fields will be added to all text records as well. After all the records have had 33X fields added, the final step will be to remove the GMDs from every record in the database. During the transition period, users may encounter hybrid records that contain both a GMD and 33X fields. \nExample 1 after update", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "materia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "marc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "w. bruce fye", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nlm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national library of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nlm tech bull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medical university of south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "health communications network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gmd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T04:30:31.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70f1e31fe07c335955733eba4feb65e8fbe84c57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQFaRgO9YYwOK5DqMrQgYsUVjyFc6Ct7WoWh_rjDCUT7eh76j06P43sYGZjs_Lmsy9lFafU3._voj5x_yOSVRdJfjkfVkSJ9.BMzsbvdAp5e4WKtxi6mDPhsPESYFlCHKw9Wbw8.V022GNNJfL9Yvx4.dDgw9.XlCSfG_curpNSDP7jtTVuXD23bpFGsFv3UiX4W9HFrA0BpA--", "site_full": "www.niehs.nih.gov", "site": "nih.gov", "site_section": "http://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/newsroom/rssfeed/rss_peph_news.xml", "site_categories": ["environmental_safety", "home_and_garden", "law_government_and_politics", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "PEPH News RSS Feed", "title": "Teen Researchers Study Pesticide Exposure, Share Results with their Community", "title_full": "Teen Researchers Study Pesticide Exposure, Share Results with their Community", "published": "2017-10-07T00:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.niehs.nih.gov/about/assets/images/niehs_default_image_facebook_twitter.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 213, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70f1e31fe07c335955733eba4feb65e8fbe84c57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQFaRgO9YYwOK5DqMrQgYsUVjyFc6Ct7WoWh_rjDCUT7eh76j06P43sYGZjs_Lmsy9lFafU3._voj5x_yOSVRdJfjkfVkSJ9.BMzsbvdAp5e4WKtxi6mDPhsPESYFlCHKw9Wbw8.V022GNNJfL9Yvx4.dDgw9.XlCSfG_curpNSDP7jtTVuXD23bpFGsFv3UiX4W9HFrA0BpA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-07T00:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Teen Researchers Study Pesticide Exposure, Share Results with their Community", "text": "Visiting NIEHS Teen Researchers Study Pesticide Exposure, Share Results with their Community \nIn collaboration with scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), a group of Latino high school students are investigating how teen girls living in California's Salinas Valley are exposed to pesticides. \nThe young researchers used silicone wristbands to measure personal exposures and detected nearly 70 different pesticides. They also discovered several factors associated with reduced exposure, including regular household cleaning or placing a doormat at the entryway of the home. The students are members of the Chamacos Youth Council (CYC), which has helped conduct several research projects in collaboration with scientists at the UC Berkeley Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health (CERCH) . \nCYC members recently shared early study results in a KION TV news story ( Spanish version , starts at 6:20). They are now exploring ways to use their findings to reduce pesticide exposure among teens in their community. \nMore than 9 million pounds of pesticides are applied to crop fields every year in the Salinas Valley, according to Kim Harley, Ph.D., who leads health effects research at CERCH. \"Our study focuses on teenage girls because they are undergoing rapid reproductive development, and adolescence may be a time when they are particularly susceptible to endocrine disrupting or carcinogenic pesticides,\" explained Harley. \"We assume that people who live in agricultural communities are exposed to pesticides, but there is a lot we don't know; there are hundreds of different kinds of pesticides with different toxicities, application methods, and propensities to drift off-site. We want to know more about which pesticides are making it into people's homes.\" \nOne hundred teen girls living in the Salinas Valley participated in the Chamacos of Salinas Examining Chemicals in Homes and Agriculture (COSECHA) study. For one week, each girl wore a silicone wristband to measure personal pesticide exposure and carried a GPS device to track how close they got to agricultural fields. The CYC also collected dust samples from the girls' homes. \nCYC members are now sharing what they have learned so far with the Salinas community. \"This study allows us to engage and empower local youth in environmental health research and uses a peer-to-peer model to disseminate study results to other youth in the community,\" said Harley. \nThe CYC is creating several radio skits to inform the community about potential exposures and ways to reduce exposure. Starting in late October, one radio skit will be released every week on the COSECHA study webpage and social media accounts. They also are developing an instructional video to show residents how to access and use maps of pesticide use around their homes. \n\"We believe everyone has a right to know about their potential exposures. Our goal is to inform our community but also teach them about alternatives to using pesticides and how to protect themselves from pesticides,\" said high school senior and CYC member Giselle Lazaro. \nThe COSECHA study is a community research collaborative funded by the California Breast Cancer Research Program.

Abstract \nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disorder influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors, as well as their interactions. Since elevated oxidative stress and protease activity characterize the pathogenesis of COPD, variants of genes that can affect these processes have been commonly studied in COPD. However, interactions among genes that can influence oxidative stress and protease activity remain poorly investigated in COPD. The aim of this study was to look into the role of functional variants in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 9, and 12 in the occurrence and/or modulation of COPD, and to analyze their interactions with glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) M1, T1, and P1 in the pathogenesis of COPD in Serbians. The MMP1 rs1799750 G > GG, MMP9 rs3918242 C > T, and MMP12 rs2276109 A > G variants were analyzed by direct detection methods. Gene-gene interactions between variants in MMPs and GSTs were assessed using a case-control model. Our results showed association of the MMP1 GG/GG genotype with COPD (p = 0.036, OR = 2.50). Gene-gene interactions between the GSTM1 null and MMP1 GG (p = 0.028, OR = 2.99) and the GSTM1 null and MMP12 AA variants (p = 0.015, OR = 3.82) were found to significantly increase the risk of COPD occurrence. Furthermore, the MMP12 G variant was found to modify the age of COPD onset (p = 0.025, OR = 3.30), while interaction between the GSTM1 null and MMP9 T variants was found to modify the severity of disease (p = 0.019, OR = 4.83). To our best knowledge, this is the first study revealing several gene-gene interactions affecting oxidative stress and protease activity in the pathogenesis of COPD.

Abstract AIM: \nThe application of complete mesocolic excision (CME) in colon cancer is controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the safety, quality and effect of CME with non-complete mesocolic excision (NCME) in patients with colon cancer. METHOD: \nWe searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus to identify studies comparing CME with NCME in colon cancer. We focused on three study outcome areas: safety (operation time, blood loss, complications, mortality); quality (large bowel length, distance from the tumour to the high vascular tie, area of mesentery, total lymph nodes); and effect (long-term survival). RESULTS: \nA total of 8586 patients from 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis. CME was associated with greater intraoperative blood loss (weighted mean difference (WMD) 79.87, 95%CI 65.88 - 93.86), more postoperative surgical complications (RR 1.23, 95%CI 1.08 - 1.40), longer large bowel resection (WMD 47.06, 95%CI 10.49 - 83.62), greater distance from the tumour to the high vascular tie (WMD 17.51, 95%CI 15.16 - 19.87), larger area of mesentery (WMD 36.09, 95%CI 18.06 - 54.13) and more lymph nodes (WMD 6.13, 95%CI 1.97 - 10.28) than NCME. CME also had positive effects on 5-year survival (HR 0.33; 95%CI 0.13 - 0.81), 3-year survival (HR 0.58; 95%CI 0.39 - 0.86) and 3-year survival for stage III disease (HR 0.69; 95%CI 0.60 - 0.80) compared with NCME. CONCLUSION: \nLimited evidence suggests that CME is a more effective strategy for improving specimen quality and survival but with a higher complication rate. This article is protected by copyright.

[Epub ahead of print] Marrow compartment contribution to cortical defect healing. a Orthopaedics, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences , Link\u00f6ping University , Link\u00f6ping , Sweden. Abstract \nBackground and purpose - Healing of shaft fractures is commonly described as regards external callus. We wanted to clarify the role of the bone marrow compartment in the healing of stable shaft fractures. Patients and methods - A longitudinal furrow was milled along the longitudinal axis of the femoral shaft in mice. The exposed bone marrow under the furrow was scooped out. The mice were then randomized to no further treatment, or to receiving 2 silicone plugs in the medullary canal distal and proximal to the defect. The plugs isolated the remaining marrow from contact with the defect. Results were studied with histology and flow cytometry. Results - Without silicone plugs, the marrow defect was filled with new bone marrow-like tissue by day 5, and new bone was seen already on day 10. The new bone was seen only at the level of the cortical injury, where it seemed to form simultaneously in the entire region of the removed cortex. The new bone seemed not to invade the marrow compartment, and there was a sharp edge between new bone and marrow. The regenerated marrow was similar to uninjured marrow, but contained considerably more cells. In the specimens with plugs, the marrow compartment was either filled with loose scar tissue, or empty, and there was only minimal bone formation, mainly located around the edges of the cortical injury. Interpretation - Marrow regeneration in the defect seemed to be a prerequisite for normal cortical healing. Shaft fracture treatment should perhaps pay more attention to the local bone marrow.

Abstract \nThe CliRpath Excimer Laser System to Enlarge Lumen Openings (CELLO) registry included patients treated with modified excimer laser catheters for the endovascular treatment of peripheral artery disease affecting the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and proximal popliteal artery. The aim of this study was to assess, via intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) the dissections in the vessel wall following treatment with the laser catheters. IVUS grayscale images from the CELLO registry were systematically reviewed for dissections in the treated vessel segments by two investigators. Images from 33 patients; 66 pullbacks (1867 IVUS frames in 2 phases), were successfully matched frame-to-frame to evaluate identical segments of the treated vessels in the two phases; post-2 mm Turbo-Elite laser pilot channel creation and post Turbo-Booster laser atherectomy. Dissections were categorized as; (1) intimal, (2) medial, (3) intramural hematoma, and (4) adventitial according to the ACC Clinical Expert Consensus Document classification of dissections. An average of 57 frames was evaluated per pullback, giving a total of 3734 frames (1867 matched for pre-ablation (post channel creation) and post-ablation phases). Treatments with the modified Excimer laser catheters resulted in a significant increase in lumen area of 5.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2-mm 2 (95% CI 4.3-6.8, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and reduction in plaque plus media volume of -10.6\u2009\u00b1\u200936.0 mm 3 (95% CI -25.8 to 4.6, p\u2009=\u20090.1619) whilst giving rise to mainly intramural hematoma formations post Turbo-Booster laser treatment in 55% of frames assessed and 24% medial dissections with less than 1% adventitial disruption. The Excimer laser based Turbo-Booster treatment of peripheral artery lesions resulted in significant plaque debulking and increased lumen diameter with negligible degree of adventitial layer injury.

[Epub ahead of print] Balance in children following cochlear implantation. a Royal Victoria Hospital , Belfast , Northern Ireland. Abstract OBJECTIVES: \nTo assess the vestibular function of children who had unilateral and bilateral cochlear implants compared with a control group of otherwise healthy children who had not been implanted. STUDY DESIGN: \nObservational case-control study. METHODS: \nPosturography was carried out in the form of a Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance using a Wii Balance Board and the Vestio App on an iPod Touch. Thirty children in total were tested, 10 children in each cohort. Results in the form of root mean square calculations were available for each child. RESULTS: \nResults showed a significant difference in the vestibular function of implanted children and the non-implanted control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). As expected, children in all groups had more difficulty maintaining posture with their eyes closed on a compliant surface (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Thirty per cent of children with bilateral and 10% with unilateral cochlear implants were unable to complete testing. CONCLUSIONS: \nOur study demonstrates posturography as an inexpensive, easily operated tool that can be used to assess paediatric vestibular function. It showed a significant difference between the control group and the implanted groups. Further work prompted by this study will include interval post-operative testing to more accurately assess the effect that implantation has on vestibular function.

These priorities serve as guidance to NIMH grantees, potential grant applicants, and staff for the design and implementation of future research. \nDeveloped and reviewed by NIMH subject matter experts and thought leaders, these updates are designed to ensure that the NIMH\u2019s priorities continue to advance research across the Institute\u2019s four Strategic Objectives outlined in its 2015 Strategic Plan for Research , reflect the current state of the science, address gaps in research areas, and promote scientific discovery and service delivery. \nThe Strategic Research Priorities continue to emphasize the importance of research approaches that enhance rigor and reproducibility, include sex as a biological variable, consider prevention through early intervention, aim to reduce mental health disparities, and maintain a global perspective on mental health across the priority areas. \nThe Strategic Research Priorities also continue to highlight NIMH\u2019s ongoing commitment to data sharing and the use of common data elements. The updated Strategic Research Priorities encourage work using computational approaches that may provide novel ways to understand relationships among data in complex, integrative datasets to further our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of mental illnesses. As new tools emerge from the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies\u00ae (BRAIN) Initiative , NIMH expects these tools to advance the understanding of the development, maintenance, and recovery from mental illnesses. \nNIMH updates its Strategic Research Priorities on an annual basis to provide timely guidance to investigators and promote rapid acceleration of scientific discovery.

Researchers from Spain found that people who regularly skipped breakfast were more likely to have atherosclerosis \u2013 hardening and thickening of the arteries due to a build-up of fatty deposits known as plaques. \nAtherosclerosis doesn't usually cause any noticeable symptoms at first but can eventually lead to life-threatening problems, such as heart attacks and strokes, if it gets worse. \nThe researchers looked at the breakfast habits and artery health of around 4,000 middle-aged bank workers who were not known to have heart disease. They found those who skipped breakfast were more likely to have plaques than those who ate a breakfast containing at least a fifth of their daily calories \u2013 this would be 500kcal or more for a man whose daily intake was the recommended 2,500kcal. \nThe study is planning to follow up the participants to see what happens to their arteries over time. \nThis study can't say for certain whether skipping breakfast was affecting artery health directly, as both were assessed at the same time. However, skipping breakfast did seem to be a habit shared by people who also tended to be unhealthy in other ways, such as being more likely to be a smoker or to have a higher body mass index (BMI). \nWhile skipping breakfast may seem a tempting option if you're trying to lose weight, it's counterproductive if you find yourself having unhealthy snacks and overeating during the rest of the day. \n  study was carried out by researchers from the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III, Santander Bank, and other hospitals and research centres in Spain and the US. It was funded by the Fundaci\u00f3n Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III, Santander, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III and the European Regional Development Fund. \nThe study was published   Journal of the American College of Cardiology. \nThe research was covered well by The Guardian, which pointed out limitations and explained that skipping breakfast was not likely to be affecting heart health directly; instead, it was likely to be a marker for other unhealthy behaviours. \nThe Mail Online suggested that skipping breakfast \"triggered the same emergency response in the body as starvation\", but the study itself didn't assess this. Also, its headline stated that skipping breakfast to lose weight was the problem, but not all of the participants who skipped breakfast did so to lose weight. \nThe Daily Telegraph took a more cautious approach, explaining there may be a potential link between skipping breakfast and heart attacks but that additional research with long-term follow-up is probably required to confirm or disprove it. \n  \nPeople who skip breakfast are thought to be at greater risk of heart disease. However, no studies have so far looked at whether breakfast habits are linked to the early build-up of fatty tissue in the arteries (atherosclerosis) before a person starts to experience symptoms. Atherosclerosis is an early sign of heart disease. \nThe current study was a cross-sectional analysis looking at whether people who skipped breakfast were more likely than those who ate breakfast to have atherosclerosis that was not yet causing any symptoms of heart disease. \nThe analysis was part of the ongoing Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis (PESA) study, which will follow the participants to see whose atherosclerosis progresses. This initial analysis cannot tell us whether breakfast habits directly caused the atherosclerosis seen, as both the people's habits and their fatty tissue build-up were measured at the same time. \n  \nResearchers recruited 4,082 adults aged 40 to 54 who worked at the headquarters of Santander Bank in Madrid. To be eligible, participants could not have heart or kidney disease, could not be morbidly obese (BMI of 40 or more) and could not have a serious disease that could lead to death in the next six years. \nThey reported their breakfast habits over 15 days by filling out a detailed computerised questionnaire about what and when they ate and drank, and the researchers looked at their arteries to see if they showed signs of fatty tissue build-up. The results were then analysed to see whether breakfast habits were linked to artery health. \nThe researchers used the questionnaire information to calculate what percentage of their daily energy intake the participants consumed at breakfast. Anything eaten before 10am was considered to be breakfast, and they were grouped into those who consumed: more than 20% of their daily energy intake at breakfast (\"high-energy breakfast\") 5-20% of their daily energy intake at breakfast (\"low-energy breakfast\") less than 5% of their total energy intake at breakfast (\"skipped breakfast\") \nThe energy level for skipping breakfast was equivalent to just having an orange juice or coffee. \nThe researchers used ultrasound to assess whether people had fatty build-ups in major arteries in the neck (carotid arteries), the major artery leading from the heart through the abdomen (infrarenal abdominal aorta) and major arteries in the groin (iliofemoral arteries). They also assessed the level of calcium in the walls of the arteries supplying the heart, as this is a sign of fatty deposits. \nThis identified people who had signs of atherosclerosis either in any of the arteries, in the arteries supplying the heart or in multiple (four or more) sites. \nThey then looked at whether people with different breakfast habits were more or less likely to have atherosclerosis or other unhealthy outcomes, such as being overweight or having high blood pressure.

Researchers claim to have found a link between substance abuse at age 15, and diet of the child's mother during pregnancy. But it is far from clear that avoiding meat in pregnancy \"causes\" substance abuse in teenagers. \nThe research was based on a long-running study in the UK. Researchers asked almost 10,000 teenagers about their use of alcohol, cannabis and tobacco, and about half responded. They then looked at the dietary records the teens' mothers had filled out in pregnancy, to see if they could spot any relationships between the two. \nThe study found that children of women who ate most meat in pregnancy were less likely to be users of alcohol, cannabis or tobacco at age 15, compared to those who ate little or no meat. The researchers speculate this could be because women who don't eat meat might have low levels of vitamin B12, which affects brain development. \nHowever, we can't know that diet in pregnancy was definitely the cause. Many factors are likely to be involved in something as complex as whether a teenager uses drugs or alcohol. This study cannot rule out that factors other than diet are responsible for the link seen. \nThat said, it's important to be sure you get all the nutrients you need in pregnancy, including iron, vitamin B12 and calcium. You can do this without eating meat or dairy, though some women may need additional supplements. Read more advice on vegetarian and vegan diet during pregnancy   researchers were from the University of Bristol in the UK, and the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Rockville, University of Illinois at Chicago and University of California, San Diego, all in the US. The research was published   journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. \nThe Mail Online's headline is unnecessarily scaremongering. It quotes only the most extreme link found, and does not explain any of the limitations to the study in its article. It states that \"most vegetarians have a B12 deficiency while pregnant\", and reports on the risks associated with vitamin B12 deficiency in pregnancy, but the study did not actually assess whether any of the women had a B12 deficiency. \nThis study alone cannot prove a definite link and other factors could be contributing to the findings. \n  \nThis was an analysis of data taken from a large, ongoing prospective cohort study called the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). \nCohort studies can identify patterns that may suggest risk factors for diseases or conditions such as substance abuse, but they can't prove that one factor (in this case maternal diet) directly causes another (in this case substance abuse). This is because it is difficult to remove the impact of all other factors. \n  \nThe new study came out of a long-running UK project, which has tracked what happened to almost 15,000 babies born to women in the Bristol area in 1991 to 1992. \nIn this study, just over 5,000 children in the group (about half of those invited) answered questions about their cannabis, alcohol and tobacco use. Researchers compared their answers to the dietary records taken from their mothers 15 years earlier, during their pregnancies. They checked whether children of women who reported eating little or no meat were more likely to report using alcohol, tobacco or cannabis. \nThe researchers made efforts to account for other possible causes for their findings (confounding factors). They adjusted their figures for these factors: housing (owned, rented or social housing) and overcrowding maternal education level how many children were in the family social class of the parents occupation the mother's age when the child was born family income after the child was born parent/child relationships \nPregnant women who eat vegetarian diets may find it difficult to get enough vitamin B12 \u2013 one of the nutrients found in meat and important for brain development. The researchers thought that the mother's levels of B12 could be responsible for their findings. \nTo test this, they also carried out a study in which they looked at women's genetic variations, which may affect their ability to use vitamin B12. They looked separately at women with and without these specific genetic variants and whether there was a link between meat eating and children's substance abuse. \nWhat were the basic results? \nOf the 9,979 teenagers invited to take part, 5,246 attended. About 10% of teenagers reported one of the following: behavioural problems due to drinking alcohol (such as getting into fights because of drinking) moderate use of cannabis (defined as using cannabis \"at least occasionally\") using tobacco on a weekly basis \nThe researchers carried out various analyses looking at different aspects of diet and these substance use outcomes. They found that teenagers born to mothers who had a \"vegetarian\" diet pattern had: 28% higher odds of having behavioural problems associated with alcohol (odds ratio (OR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.41) 42% higher odds of using cannabis moderately (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.55) 21% higher odds of using tobacco weekly (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33) \nThe study also found that the chances of having one of these substance abuse problems tended to lessen the more meat a woman reported eating. \nThe \"three times more likely to have kids who abuse drugs or alcohol\" figure quoted in the Mail Online's headline seems to relate to the comparison of women who never ate meat compared to women who ate meat daily in pregnancy \u2013 the teens born to women who never ate meat had 2.7 times the odds of being moderate cannabis users (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.89 to 4.00). The links with the other substance use outcomes were lower (OR for alcohol problems 1.75, and OR for weekly tobacco use 1.85). \nIn the genetic part of their study, the researchers found that the links between the mother's meat intake and her child's later substance abuse were stronger in women who had genetic variations that may allow the body to use vitamin B12 more efficiently. For women with a genetic variation that meant they couldn't use B12 so well, their children's risk of substance abuse was not linked to the amount of meat they ate. \nThat could be because eating more meat did not translate into more vitamin B12 for women with this genetic variation. \nHow did the researchers interpret the results? \nThe researchers said:\"This study identifies low meat consumption in the prenatal period as [a] potentially modifiable risk factor for adolescent substance use.\" They say that socioeconomic differences between women who did or did not eat meat were \"unlikely to explain\" their findings. \nThey say that vitamin B12 deficiency is \"highly likely\" to contribute to their findings, and suggest more fortification of foods with vegetarian sources of B12, and greater use of supplements. \nConclusion \nWhile having too little vitamin B12 in your diet during pregnancy can affect a baby's development, it remains to be proven whether a vegetarian diet in pregnancy can cause substance abuse problems in teenage offspring. \nThe findings do not mean that vegetarian pregnant women need to start eating meat. It is already recommended that vegetarian and vegan mums-to-be take special care to ensure they get enough of certain nutrients that are found in meat and fish, such as vitamin B12, vitamin D and iron. The study identifies a possible link between having little or no meat consumption in pregnancy (which may have led to vitamin B12 deficiency) and substance abuse in the offspring, 15 years later. \nSubstance abuse is a complicated problem, it is unlikely that one factor such as maternal diet in pregnancy could have caused it. However much the researchers tried to account for other potential confounding factors, it's very difficult to untangle the mother's diet in pregnancy from everything that happened between conception and the child's 15th birthday. \nMore research is needed before we can come to more definitive conclusions. \nThe study has some limitations that may affect the reliability of the results: \nOnly half of the children invited to participate in the research at age 15 did so. We don't know what happened to the other half, or why they dropped out of the study. We don't know if their results would have supported or undermined the study findings. \nWe don't know whether the pregnant women were deficient in vitamin B12, because they weren't tested for it. We have to rely on the questionnaires they filled in about their diet back in 1991 or 1992. We don't know whether their diet changed during pregnancy, or whether they were deficient in other important nutrients. \nWe don\u2019t know how accurate the teenagers' reports of substance abuse were, or whether they reflect long-term use of alcohol, cannabis or tobacco \u2013 the research gives us a \"snapshot\" view of one point in time. \nWhile the researchers tried to take into account a number of socioeconomic factors, and also some aspects of the parent-child relationship, the effects of these complex factors are unlikely to have been fully removed. \nWhile the study doesn't add much to what we already know about diet in pregnancy, it's a reminder that pregnant women do need to ensure they get all the nutrients they and their growing baby need.
