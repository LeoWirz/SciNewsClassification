Photo credit: Ruud Schilder. No matter how often I get on the bathroom scales, they're never going to tip back to the weight that I was when I went to university. I've piled on a few pounds since then, but my legs never seemed to notice the difference. \u2018It makes sense that animals should be able to \u201cgauge\u201d how heavy they are\u2019, says Ruud Schilder from Pennsylvania State University, USA, as most creatures have to adjust the strength of their muscles over the course of their lifetime. \u2018But we really do not understand well how such adjustments are achieved\u2019, he continues. Having already shown that rats can modify their muscle by producing alternative versions of a muscle protein (troponin T, which can alter the amount of force produced by a muscle) in response to weight gain, Schilder decided to find out whether fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ) also alter which forms of troponin T they produce when they put on weight. Explaining his choice of animal, Schilder says, \u2018 Drosophila makes for an interesting organism to study this in, as there are many molecular tools we can use to study the mechanistic details of muscle adjustments\u2019. However, Schilder and undergraduate student Megan Raynor had to come up with a creative solution to help the insects gain weight rapidly. \u2018Fruit flies are fairly small, so attaching weights is not easy\u2019, chuckles Schilder. Instead, he decided to tamper with gravity by spinning the insects at high speed to increase the force pulling on their bodies; \u2018In other words, we tricked the fly leg muscles into thinking that they were supporting much heavier bodies\u2019, he says. However, Schilder had to cobble together an impromptu centrifuge by cannibalizing the remains of a human treadmill and an office chair to increase the flies\u2019 weight 12-fold from 0.49\u20130.77 mg to 5.88\u20139.24 mg. Spinning the flies for 24 h, Schilder and Raynor tested the strength of the flies\u2019 legs and found that the insects were better climbers and jumpers. Their leg muscles were much stronger than those of flies that had not gained weight. And when Schilder checked how stressful the insects had found the experienced \u2013 by comparing the metabolic rate of the spun insects with that of insects that had remained static \u2013 he was surprised that the fruit flies were unaffected: \u2018[they] seemed rather unimpressed by the whole affair\u2019, he recalls. However, when Schilder analysed which forms of troponin T (ranging from troponin T_A to troponin T_F) the flies were likely to be incorporating into their leg muscles, by looking at the different troponin T mRNA molecules (which are then converted into protein), he was impressed to see noticeable shifts in the mRNA distributions of the spun flies. One form (troponin T_A) dropped off dramatically in the legs of the bulkiest flies, while the legs of the daintiest insects produced almost as much of the troponin T_A mRNA as the unspun insects. \u2018The effect of weight increase on troponin T transcription depended on the actual weight load experienced by Drosophila leg muscles\u2019, says Schilder. So, it seems that fruit flies have some sort of sensor that can detect when they are gaining weight that triggers leg muscle modifications, and the response is remarkably fast. Schilder also suspects that other animals may share the same mechanism, having previously discovered that rats also modify their muscles in response to weight gain. \u2018We don't know yet what the sensors are, but our results support the existence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that translates body weight variation into appropriate skeletal muscle molecular and functional responses\u2019, he says. \u00a9 2017.

Photo credit: Heidi Fuchs. The numbers are staggering: for every oyster that makes it onto a dinner plate, 10 million siblings perished as larvae, and the factors that lead to such shocking statistics fascinate Heidi Fuchs from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, USA. Having realised early in her career that water turbulence can determine where the larvae of bottom-dwelling species settle, Fuchs discovered recently that oyster larvae swim harder \u2013 propelled by microscopic hairs (cilia) covering two fleshy oval wings that protrude out of the larva's shell \u2013 when they are tumbling in strong currents: \u2018[which] made me wonder about the energetic cost to the larvae and how much they would have to eat to make up for it\u2019, says Fuchs. Could agitated larvae consume enough in choppy conditions to sustain their turbulent lifestyle? Despite their minute size, Fuchs reckons that oyster larvae ( Crassostrea virginica ) are some of the easiest plankton to work with; \u2018We get them delivered overnight from a hatchery\u2019, she explains. However, measuring the oxygen consumption of the minute 2-week-old molluscs and observing their swimming manoeuvres as they swirled around in water simulating eddies in a gentle stream through to smashing storm breakers was technically challenging. \u2018Fortunately, Adam Christman perfected some techniques in advance and my graduate student, Jackie Specht, was able to assist\u2019, says Fuchs, recalling how Specht took charge of the oxygen measurements that would tell them how much energy the larvae consumed, while she monitored the larvae's swimming movements. The duo also added microscopic algae ( Isochrysis galbana ) to the swishing water during some of the trials, to investigate how much the turbulence affected the larvae's ability to feed. Monitoring the larvae, the team could see that although the tiny youngsters spent more time swimming downward in the roughest conditions, on the occasions when they swam upward, their energy consumption doubled, even though their energy use became more efficient \u2013 thanks to the turbulence counteracting the effects of gravity. And the larvae that were provided with an algae diet used more energy than the unfed larvae as they beat their propulsive cilia to produce a feeding current, in addition to propelling themselves through the water. However, Fuchs and Diane Adams were most surprised at the impact that the churning water had on the larvae's ability to feed. Although the young oysters bumped into more algae in the choppiest conditions, they grasped hold of less food. \u2018Our interpretation is that the water motion\u2026 made it more difficult for the cilia to handle or retain food particles. We suspect that the larvae can increase their ciliary activity for either swimming or feeding, but they cannot do both at full capacity at the same time, so in strong turbulence they focus most efforts on swimming\u2019, says Fuchs. In fact, the larvae were so seriously impaired that they were unable to consume enough food to survive in the most turbulent waters, no matter how many algae were available. Fuchs says, \u2018Our observations suggest that many of these larvae could be lost to turbulence-induced starvation\u2019, admitting that she is surprised by how badly the young oysters are affected. However, she suspects that smaller (younger) larvae may be at less risk of starvation, as they have not developed their sense of balance and should conserve more energy by spending less time swimming against the turbulent conditions. \u00a9 2017.

Photo credit: Wayne Vogl. Every diving animal that depends on air to breathe faces the challenge of crushing pressures compressing every tissue in their bodies, including the lungs, as they descend. Elastic tissues, such as arteries, which expand to accommodate pressure surges above the surface, become vulnerable to compression as soon as an air breather leaves the surface. \u2018A few years ago, we discovered that the mechanical properties of fin whale arteries were different from those of typical terrestrial animals\u2019, says Margo Lillie, who \u2013 with colleagues, Robert Shadwick and Wayne Vogl from the University of British Columbia (UBC) Canada, and others \u2013 discovered that the arteries are remarkably resistant to collapse, which may protect them during a dive. However, the trio also realised that the distinctive bobbing swimming style of whales and dolphins \u2013 where they beat their tails up and down \u2013 might also place arteries under increasing pressure if the animals compress their abdomen with each downward tail beat. Intrigued by the possibility that the abdomens of these diving mammals may be under more pressure than had been realised, the team wondered whether the divers\u2019 diaphragms might be reinforced in some way to withstand the additional abdominal pressure generated during each downward tail beat. Together, the team collected over 20 whale and dolphin diaphragms over a 5 year period. \u2018We relied heavily on a network of people who collect the carcasses of animals that stranded on the shore and we also got diaphragms collected as part of a Canadian biological sampling programme and a commercial whaling operation in Iceland\u2019, says Lillie. Although it was possible to ship most of the organs back to Vancouver, Lillie, Shadwick, Vogl and Stephen Raverty from the Animal Health Centre, Canada, had to travel to Iceland to investigate the colossal 1.5 m-wide fin whale diaphragms. \u2018Compared to the diaphragms of terrestrial animals, the cetacean diaphragms looked so complex and they vary from one species to another, so it took me a while to start seeing patterns\u2019, admits Lillie. However, it eventually became clear that the animals\u2019 diaphragms were reinforced with a network of stiff collagen fibres. \u2018There is a lot of variation in the amount of collagen on the surface of the diaphragm\u2019, says Lillie; \u2018There was hardly any on the beluga and minke diaphragms, while the Dall's porpoise diaphragm was covered with it\u2019, she adds. Suspecting that the amount of reinforcement was related to the strength of the species\u2019 tail beats \u2013 and therefore their swimming speed \u2013 Lillie was pleased when she realised that the diaphragms of the fastest swimming species \u2013 the Dall's and harbour porpoises \u2013 were covered in the highest proportion of collagen (almost 60%), while the slowest species \u2013 the belugas, and fin and minke whales \u2013 had the lowest proportion of collagen (\u223c10%). \u2018We were surprised how closely the amount of collagen correlated with speed. It means that collagen deposited on the diaphragm could be necessary to withstand increased abdominal pressures associated with swimming\u2019, says Lillie. And when they compared the whale and dolphin's diaphragm structures with those of other diving mammals (seals and sea lions), which probably do not compress their abdomens when beating their tails from side to side, there was no evidence of the extensive collagen reinforcement. Reflecting on the discovery, Lillie says, \u2018The evolutionary decision to swim by moving the flukes up and down instead of side to side appears to have altered the design of the diaphragm\u2019, and now she and Shadwick are keen to find out how the increase in abdominal pressure has affected the return flow of blood through veins to these animals\u2019 hearts. \u00a9 2017.

But Craig Franklin from The University of Queensland, Australia, is concerned that startled croc youngsters may not be able to remain safely submerged for as long as they do now as the climate continues warming. When so-called \u2018cold blooded\u2019 (ectothermic) animals get warmer, they consume oxygen faster as their metabolism increases, possibly restricting how long frightened crocodiles can remain submerged when avoiding a threat. Teaming up with Essie Rodgers, Franklin measured how long scared juvenile crocodiles can remain submerged at current river water temperatures and the temperatures that crocodiles are predicted to encounter in 2100 to find out how these reptiles may fare in the future. After adapting the young crocodiles to modern day (28\u00b0C water) or future (34\u00b0C) climate scenarios for 2 months, Rodgers startled the animals with a gentle tap on the back and timed how long they remained submerged. Impressively, the crocodiles that were adapted to current climate conditions were content to remain submerged for 18.5 min, extending to over an hour if they felt particularly harassed after performing four consecutive dives. However, the hot water crocodiles could only remain under water for 9 min after a single tap on the back and the more threatened animals only stayed down for 28 min. Rodgers also measured the animals\u2019 heart rates and oxygen consumption to try to understand why the hot water animals\u2019 refuge tactics were so impaired, and found that the crocodiles that had adapted to 2100's predicted warmer temperatures were unable to lower their metabolism as much as the cooler crocodiles, burning through oxygen at a faster rate, forcing them to return to the surface sooner than their cooler cousins. \u2018This finding suggests predator avoidance dives may be shortened if water temperatures continue to increase in marine and freshwater habitats\u2019, warn Rodgers and Franklin, who are concerned that crocodile youngsters will become more vulnerable to predators as they are likely to have to surface more frequently if the temperature continues rising. \u00a9 2017.

Don't hold your breath! Without oxygen, your cells \u2013 like those in most vertebrates \u2013 are unable to produce enough energy to supply even basic cellular demands and they quickly die. But certain members of the Carassius genus, such as crucian carp, are able to withstand long periods with little to no oxygen at low temperatures, conditions they encounter during winter beneath frozen lakes. Their remarkable anoxia tolerance is thanks to a unique metabolic pathway in their muscle cells that allows pyruvate, an intermediate breakdown product of glucose, to be processed by the cells in a way that still produces energy but does not require oxygen. This anaerobic energy-producing process involves the conversion of pyruvate into ethanol, and this is something that other vertebrates cannot do. However, despite the passage of nearly 4 decades since the discovery of ethanol production by Carassius muscle cells, a team of researchers headed by Norwegian scientists G\u00f6ran Nilsson and Stian Ellefsen has only just elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying this metabolic novelty for extreme anoxia tolerance. When they started their research, the team knew that in the presence of oxygen, pyruvate enters the aerobic metabolic pathway after being converted in a series of steps to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme (PDH) complex. But in the absence of oxygen, Carassius muscle cells instead convert pyruvate into acetaldehyde, which is then converted to ethanol by another enzyme. The researchers wanted to figure out how pyruvate is converted into acetaldehyde, so they began by sequencing every gene component of the PDH complex in Carassius . They soon realized that Carassius are endowed with extra copies of the PDH complex enzymes thanks to a genome duplication event in Carassius ancestors long ago. The team also noticed that some of these extra copies, in particular the first enzymes in the complex (E1\u03b1 and E1\u03b2), which are responsible for initiating pyruvate conversion, now contained important sequence differences that would change their function. Importantly, these sequence modifications were not present in the anoxia-intolerant Carassius cousin the common carp, which further implicated these new genes in bestowing anoxia tolerance. To test whether the new E1\u03b1 and E1\u03b2 were responsible for driving pyruvate towards ethanol synthesis under anoxic conditions, the research team kept Carassius in either fully oxygenated water or oxygen-depleted water for up to 1 week and then quantified and compared the expressions of the old and newly identified E1\u03b1 and E1\u03b2 genes. As suspected, the researchers found that Carassius muscle, the major ethanol-producing tissue during anoxia, expressed considerably more of the new E1\u03b1 and E1\u03b2 genes than the old ones (about 100 times more). They also found that brain, which does not produce ethanol during anoxia, only expressed the old E1\u03b1 and E1\u03b2 genes. Interestingly, the team showed that this expression pattern was the same irrespective of the oxygen content in the fish's aquaria; instead, anoxia changes the phosphorylation state of E1\u03b1 and E1\u03b2 in Carassius muscle. As regulating phosphorylation takes a fraction of the time that it takes to transcribe and translate new proteins from genes, this means that Carassius are primed for anoxia and can rapidly switch between the aerobic and anaerobic pyruvate pathways. Now you can breathe easy \u2013 the mystery of ethanol production in Carassius muscle cells is solved! \u00a9 2017.

Rozen Journal of Experimental Biology 2017 220: 3402 doi: 10.1242/jeb.147579 Daniel E. Rozen PDF Fear of death is a fairly strong motivator. And yet, animals get eaten all the time despite constant vigilance for predators in their midst. The problem is that animals are multi-purpose machines: they eat, they mate, they hunt for food and mates, and so on, and these activities can get in the way of spying for predators. This trade-off is particularly acute for males with conspicuous sexual signals. But as shown by Alexandra McQueen and her colleagues from Monash University in Victoria and the Australian National University in Canberra, male birds can adapt their behaviors to mitigate the risks of their flashy sexuality. Even more striking, so too can their drab neighbors. Superb fairy-wrens are small Australian birds that live in social groups composed of a mating pair and a handful of male helpers. While females and non-mating males are an inconspicuous dull brown, mating males sport a plumage of pure blue brilliance. This matters, because not only do these fancy guys get the girl they're with (at least socially), but their blueness also attracts females from other territories as extra-pair mates. But being attractive is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, greater visibility leads to more offspring sired. On the other hand, a bright blue male is an easier target to visual predators than a dull brown one. And the blue males seem to be aware of this. McQueen and her colleagues found striking differences in the behaviors of blue and brown birds. While brown birds spent most of their time foraging in open landscape, their blue counterparts eschewed the open space and opted instead to forage in or near shrubbery. In addition, blue birds spent considerably more time scanning the landscape, presumably to aid in predator detection. And when the team spooked the birds by playing a recording that signaled an alarm, the blue birds were far more likely to flee into cover and they remained hidden for more than twice as long as brown birds. These results suggest that blue birds assess their own predation risk and act to reduce it. What's more surprising is that brown birds nearby also take advantage of the blue bird's caution. They spent less time searching for predators if a blue bird was around and also spent less time hiding in the bushes after they were spooked by the alarm. I'm reminded of the old joke about a pair of campers and an attacking bear. While one camper laces up his running shoes, his friend questions why, as he'll be outrun by the bear anyway. The first responds that he doesn't need to outrun the bear, just him. Just like this camper, brown birds seem to distinguish absolute and relative risks. When on their own, they flee from perceived danger. But when in the presence of more conspicuous bait, brown birds can be more relaxed. They seem to understand that they don't need to outfly the predator, just the snazzy player in the blue suit. \u00a9 2017.

Whereas large mammals usually just grow thicker hair during winter for protection from the cold, many small mammals, as well as the newborns of larger species, typically use a more complex mechanism to stay warm in winter: they produce heat in a specialized organ, the brown adipose tissue (also often called brown fat), in a process involving the thermogenic protein UCP1. But this mechanism has been lost in some species. Pigs, for example, lost this mechanism about 20 million years ago. As a result, many pig species are very sensitive to cold and early death of piglets is a major problem in the swine industry. But not all pig breeds are sensitive to cold, suggesting that other mechanisms of heat production must have evolved in those breeds. Jun Lin from the Chinese Academy of Science and colleagues from different institutes speculated that another protein called UCP3, basically a relative of UCP1, could play a role in heat production in pigs. The team focused on the Tibetan pig, a breed that occurs at high altitudes and is quite tolerant to cold exposure. The researchers first confirmed that Tibetan pigs do not have brown adipose tissue or functional UCP1. They then placed the piglets in a cold room and compared the response of the cold-tolerant Tibetan pigs with the response of Bama pigs, a species that is known to be very sensitive to cold exposure. In addition to looking out for a drop in body temperature in both breeds, the researchers also compared the structure of fat cells at body locations in which brown fat occurs in other species, as well as expression patterns of the genes that are active after cold exposure. The study found that both breeds shivered when exposed to the cold and were able to maintain a normal body temperature thanks to the muscle contractions. However, treating the animals with a drug that inhibits shivering led to a marked decrease of body temperature in the Bama pigs, whereas the Tibetan pigs were still able to keep warm. This indicated that Tibetan pigs must have an alternative heat production mechanism. Furthermore, when the team compared the structure of fat cells from the two breeds after they had been kept in the cold room for a few hours, they found evidence of the appearance of beige fat cells, which have similar heat production potential to that of brown adipose tissue, in Tibetan pigs but not in Bama pigs. Looking into the genes that were upregulated in both breeds after cold exposure, the team again found marked differences. While the genes that were upregulated in the cold-sensitive Bama pigs had nothing to do with heat production, the genes that showed increased expression in Tibetan pigs did. And one of them was the gene coding for the UCP3 protein, which occurred primarily in the beige fat cells. Further analyses then revealed similarities in the protein structure between pig UCP3 and UCP1 in rodents, the protein that is involved in heat production in brown adipose tissue. Importantly, when Lin and colleagues extended the analysis to other breeds, they found the same results in Min pigs \u2013 another breed that can tolerate cold temperatures \u2013 but not in breeds that have trouble coping in the cold. Although it is not yet clear how UCP3 works, this study suggests that it is involved in heat generation and contributes to the cold tolerance of pig species living in cold habitats. \u00a9 2017.

Reeve Journal of Experimental Biology 2017 220: 3404 doi: 10.1242/jeb.147595 Michelle A. Reeve PDF Before coming down to roost, starlings regularly flock together in murmurations of thousands of individual birds moving in synchrony, creating one of nature's most impressive aerial displays. This sight has piqued the curiosity of many scientists across different fields and, as a result, we know how these murmurations function, with each bird following the movements of their six or seven nearest neighbours. Despite this, we still don't know why starlings come together in such large numbers. There are two hypotheses that attempt to explain this behaviour: the \u2018warmer together\u2019 hypothesis, which suggests that starlings gather to advertise a roost site, with the roost becoming warmer as more birds join; and the \u2018safer together\u2019 hypotheses, suggesting that large murmurations confuse predators, make individual birds harder to pinpoint and attack, and simply reduce the chances of any one individual being preyed upon. A team of researchers, headed by Anne Goodenough at the University of Gloucestershire, UK, harnessed the power of citizen science to try and determine which of these is the case. They sent out surveys to members of the public asking for details of murmuration sightings from across the UK, as well as several other countries. In addition to the location, respondents were asked to estimate the number of birds present and the duration of the murmuration event, to log how it ended (did the birds go to roost or disperse?), the temperature and the presence of other birds, namely predatory species \u2013 such as kestrels, sparrowhawks and buzzards \u2013 and corvids and gulls, which when silhouetted could be mistaken for predatory species. From these surveys, over 3200 records of starling murmurations were collected. By putting the different variables together in a model, the team could analyse which were correlated with murmuration size. They found that the temperature was not significantly linked to the number of starlings in a murmuration; however, the presence of predatory birds was positively associated with larger murmurations, providing evidence for the safer together hypothesis. Interestingly, murmuration size was not linked to the presence of gulls or corvids, suggesting that starlings may be able to distinguish avian predators from other visually similar species. However, this link isn't as simple as it sounds. With these data it is difficult to tease apart cause and effect; so, do large murmurations congregate because predators are close by, or are the predators in fact simply attracted to a bigger group of birds? Despite this, the power of citizen science has, for the first time, enabled a large enough dataset to be assembled for a robust analysis of starling murmuration behaviour to be undertaken. Citizen science is a powerful and growing tool for researchers to draw upon. Although it is not without limitations \u2013 such as potential recording errors from untrained participants \u2013 it is an extremely effective way of generating large datasets from which to test or generate hypotheses, as well as increasing public interest and involvement in science. Just like the starlings, when many individuals come together to work towards a common goal, great things can be achieved. \u00a9 2017.

Amador Journal of Experimental Biology 2017 220: 3404-3405; doi: 10.1242/jeb.147603 Molly H. B. Amador PDF Honeybees likely use relational information to decide which flowers are optimal for foraging nectar. For instance, laboratory research has shown that the bees are able to discriminate between sizes of stimuli as well as their relative positions and can apply learned rules to make decisions. Such experiments have typically presented bees with a choice among simultaneously encountered images or objects. Scarlett Howard at RMIT University in Australia, in partnership with colleagues at Australia's University of Melbourne and Monash University as well as the Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse in France, wanted to find out whether honeybees trained to prefer a certain relative size of artificial flower (larger or smaller) could apply those preferences to flowers presented one after another \u2013 in other words, whether the bees could remember the flowers they saw previously in making decisions about subsequent flowers. The research team also wanted to investigate whether honeybees could exercise their size preferences when encountering flowers of a new size outside of their training range. To address their research questions, the scientists first trained two groups of honeybees to prefer either larger or smaller artificial flowers presented in a viewing chamber that only allowed the bees to view one flower at a time (to prevent simultaneous size comparisons). Offering the bees a choice of four flowers \u2013 two identical larger flowers and two identical smaller flowers \u2013 the team allowed the bees to select a flower by landing on a small platform beneath. The bees were rewarded with a sugary substance when they landed by the flower of the relative size that they were being trained to prefer, or were discouraged from landing with a foul-tasting substance when they selected the wrong flower. After training, the bees were reintroduced into the chamber for the first test, in which they were asked to identify the relative flower size (larger or smaller) that they had just been trained to choose, without the benefit of a reward, to prove that they could select the correct flower size. Then, in a separate trial, the bees were given choices between flowers that were completely outside of the size ranges they had seen before, to assess whether they could apply their learned size preferences to unfamiliar flowers and select either the larger or the smaller of the two flower sizes according to the size they had learned to prefer during training. Howard and her colleagues discovered that the bees were able to learn to choose flowers based on their relative sizes, and they were also able to correctly choose between flower sizes that were outside of the size range they had encountered previously. These results indicate that the honeybees are able to remember what previously viewed flowers looked like, and can compare the remembered images with successive flowers in order to make informed choices. The ability of the bees to discriminate between flowers of new sizes also shows that they are able to extrapolate learned preferences to novel situations. In all, the study suggests that honeybees have considerable cognitive ability and are able to hold information in their working memory to aid in decision-making processes. Clearly, honeybees are not simply bumbling about when foraging for food; rather, their brains are buzzing as they choose the perfect flower. \u00a9 2017.

Here, we describe the distribution of fast and slow muscle fibers in the pectoral fins of Polypterus senegalus , an amphibious, basal actinopterygian. Each of the four muscle groups examined using mATPase staining showed distinct fiber-type regionalization. Comparison between fish raised in aquatic and terrestrial environments revealed terrestrially reared fish possess 28% more fast muscle compared with aquatically reared fish. The pattern of proximal\u2013distal variation in the abductors differed, with a relative decrease in fast muscle fibers near the pectoral girdle in aquatic fish compared with an increase in terrestrial fish. Terrestrially reared fish also possess a greater proportion of very small diameter fibers, suggesting that they undergo more growth via hyperplasia. These observations may be a further example of adaptive plasticity in Polypterus , allowing for greater bursts of power during terrestrial locomotion.

We compare our results with more experimentally difficult and mathematically sophisticated techniques for identifying patterns in fluid flows, and suggest that our tool represents an essential \u2018middle ground\u2019 allowing experimentalists to easily determine whether a system exhibits interesting flow patterns and coherent structures without resorting to more intensive techniques. In addition to being informative, the visualizations generated by our tool are often striking and elegant, illustrating coherent structures directly from videos without the need for computational overlays.

Satellite and animal motion datalogging tags were used to study the inter-nesting behavior of two female loggerhead turtles in the Gulf of Mexico, which regularly has hurricanes and tropical storms during nesting season. We contrast the behavioral patterns and swimming energetics of these two turtles, the first tracked in calm weather and the second tracked before, during and after a tropical storm. Turtle 1 was highly active and swam at the surface or submerged 95% of the time during the entire inter-nesting period, with a high estimated specific oxygen consumption rate (0.95\u2005ml\u2005min \u22121 \u2009kg \u22120.83 ). Turtle 2 was inactive for most of the first 9\u2005days of the inter-nesting period, during which she rested at the bottom (80% of the time) with low estimated oxygen consumption (0.62\u2005ml\u2005min \u22121 \u2009kg \u22120.83 ). Midway through the inter-nesting period, turtle 2 encountered a tropical storm and became highly active (swimming 88% of the time during and 95% after the storm). Her oxygen consumption increased significantly to 0.97\u2005ml\u2005min \u22121 kg \u22120.83 during and 0.98\u2005ml\u2005min \u22121 kg \u22120.83 after the storm. However, despite the tropical storm, turtle 2 returned to the nesting beach, where she successfully re-nested 75\u2005m from her previous nest. Thus, the tropical storm had a minor effect on this female's individual nesting success, even though the storm caused 90% loss nests at Casey Key.

The present study assessed how thermal imprinting during embryonic and larval stages modified the response of adult fish to low water temperature. We targeted the gilthead sea bream, which develops a condition known as winter syndrome when it is exposed to low water temperatures. Eggs and larvae of sea bream were exposed to four different thermal regimes and then the response of the resulting adults to a low temperature challenge was assessed. Sea bream exposed to a high\u2013low thermal regime as eggs and larvae (HLT; 22\u00b0C until hatch and then 18\u00b0C until larvae\u2013juvenile transition) had increased plasma cortisol and lower sodium and potassium in response to a cold challenge compared with the other thermal history groups. Plasma glucose and osmolality were increased in cold-challenged HLT fish relative to the unchallenged HLT fish. Cold challenge modified bone homeostasis/responsiveness in the low\u2013high thermal regime group (LHT) relative to other groups, and ocn , ogn1/2 , igf1 , gr and tr\u03b1/\u03b2 transcripts were all downregulated. In the low temperature group (LT) and HLT group challenged with a low temperature, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activities were decreased relative to unchallenged groups, and bone calcium content also decreased in the LT group. Overall, the results indicate that thermal imprinting during early development of sea bream causes a change in the physiological response of adults to a cold challenge.

This issue is fundamental to understanding the control of almost every joint in the body. The aim of this human experiment was to determine whether the relative activation of the heads of the triceps surae [gastrocnemius medialis (GM), gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) and soleus (SOL)] compensates for differential changes in passive force between these muscles. Twenty-four participants performed isometric ankle plantarflexion at 20\u2005N\u2005m and 20% of the active torque measured during a maximal contraction, at three ankle angles (30 deg of plantarflexion, 0 and 25 deg of dorsiflexion; knee fully extended). Myoelectric activity (electromyography, EMG) provided an index of neural drive. Muscle shear modulus (elastography) provided an index of muscle force. Passive dorsiflexion induced a much larger increase in passive shear modulus for GM (+657.6\u00b1257.7%) than for GL (+488.7\u00b1257.9%) and SOL (+106.6\u00b193.0%). However, the neural drive during submaximal tasks did not compensate for this change in the balance of the passive force. Instead, when considering the contraction at 20% MVC, GL root mean square (RMS) EMG was reduced at both 0 deg (\u221239.4\u00b134.5%) and 25 deg dorsiflexion (\u221220.6\u00b158.6%) compared with 30 deg plantarflexion, while GM and SOL RMS EMG did not change. As a result, the GM/GL ratio of shear modulus was higher at 0 deg and 25 deg dorsiflexion than at 30 deg plantarflexion, indicating that the greater the dorsiflexion angle, the stronger the bias of force to GM compared with GL. The magnitude of this change in force balance varied greatly between participants. FOOTNOTES The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

Pressure differentials could arise from ventral compression on each fluke downstroke or by a faster equilibration of the abdominal compartment with changing ambient ocean pressures compared with the thoracic compartment. If significant pressure differentials do develop, we would expect the morphology of the diaphragm to adapt to its in vivo loading. Here, we tested the hypothesis that significant pressure differentials develop between the thoracic and abdominal cavities in diving cetaceans by examining diaphragms from several cetacean and pinniped species. We found that: (1) regions of cetacean diaphragms possess subserosal collagen fibres that would stabilize the diaphragm against craniocaudal stretch; (2) subserosal collagen covers 5\u201360% of the thoracic diaphragm surface, and area correlates strongly with published values for swimming speed of each cetacean species ( P <0.001); and (3) pinnipeds, which do not locomote by vertical fluking, do not possess this subserosal collagen. These results strongly suggest that this collagen is associated with loads experienced during a dive, and they support the hypothesis that diving cetaceans experience periods during which abdominal pressures significantly exceed thoracic pressures. Our results are consistent with the generation of pressure differentials by fluking and by different compartmental equilibration rates. Pressure differentials during diving would affect venous and arterial perfusion and alter transmural pressures in abdominal arteries.

Whereas most of our knowledge of learned responses comes from experiments using free-flying bees, a tethered preparation would allow fine-scale control of the visual stimuli as well as accurate characterization of the learned responses. Unfortunately, conditioning procedures using visual stimuli in tethered bees have been limited in their efficacy. In this study, using a novel virtual reality environment and a differential training protocol in tethered walking bees, we show that the majority of honeybees learn visual stimuli, and need only six paired training trials to learn the stimulus. We found that bees readily learn visual stimuli that differ in both shape and colour. However, bees learn certain components over others (colour versus shape), and visual stimuli are learned in a non-additive manner with the interaction of specific colour and shape combinations being crucial for learned responses. To better understand which components of the visual stimuli the bees learned, the shape\u2013colour association of the stimuli was reversed either during or after training. Results showed that maintaining the visual stimuli in training and testing phases was necessary to elicit visual learning, suggesting that bees learn multiple components of the visual stimuli. Together, our results demonstrate a protocol for visual learning in restrained bees that provides a powerful tool for understanding how components of a visual stimulus elicit learned responses as well as elucidating how visual information is processed in the honeybee brain.

We measured thermoregulatory responses to acute heat stress in three species of Caprimulgiformes that nest in areas of extreme heat and aridity, the common poorwill ( Phalaenoptilus nuttallii : Caprimulgidae) and lesser nighthawk ( Chordeiles acutipennis : Caprimulgidae) in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, and the Australian owlet-nightjar ( Aegotheles cristatus : Aegothelidae) in the mallee woodlands of South Australia. We exposed wild-caught birds to progressively increasing air temperatures ( T a ) and measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL), body temperature ( T b ) and heat tolerance limit (HTL; the maximum T a reached). Comparatively low RMR values were observed in all species (0.35, 0.36 and 0.40\u2005W for the poorwill, nighthawk and owlet-nightjar, respectively), with T b approximating T a at 40\u00b0C and mild hyperthermia occurring as T a reached the HTL. Nighthawks and poorwills reached HTLs of 60 and 62\u00b0C, respectively, whereas the owlet-nightjar had a HTL of 52\u00b0C. RMR increased gradually above minima at T a of 42, 42 and 35\u00b0C, and reached 1.7, 1.9 and 2.0 times minimum resting values at HTLs in the poorwill, nighthawk and owlet-nightjar, respectively. EWL increased rapidly and linearly as T a exceeded T b and resulted in maximum rates of evaporative heat dissipation equivalent to 237\u2013424% of metabolic heat production. Bouts of gular flutter resulted in large transient increases in evaporative heat loss (50\u2013123%) accompanied by only small increments in RMR (<5%). The cavity-nesting/roosting owlet-nightjar had a lower HTL and less efficient evaporative cooling compared with the species that nest and/or roost on open desert surfaces. The high efficiency of gular flutter for evaporative cooling, combined with mild hyperthermia, provides the physiological basis for defending T b well below T a in extreme heat and is comparable to the efficient cooling observed in arid-zone columbids in which cutaneous EWL is the predominant cooling pathway.

However, flying beetles stretch out their forelegs for some reason. Why do they adopt this posture in flight? Here, we show the role of the stretched forelegs in flight of the beetle Mecynorrhina torquata . Using leg motion tracking and electromyography in flight, we found that the forelegs were voluntarily swung clockwise in yaw to induce counter-clockwise rotation of the body for turning left, and vice versa. Furthermore, we demonstrated remote control of left\u2013right turnings in flight by swinging the forelegs via a remote electrical stimulator for the leg muscles. The results and demonstration reveal that the beetle's forelegs play a supplemental role in directional steering during flight. FOOTNOTES The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

However, how animals actually perceive and make adjustments to their load-bearing musculoskeletal elements that accommodate variation in their body weight is poorly understood. We developed an experimental model system that can be used to start addressing these open questions, and uses hypergravity centrifugation to experimentally manipulate the loads experienced by Drosophila melanogaster . We examined effects of this manipulation on leg muscle alternative splicing of the sarcomere gene troponin T ( Dmel\\up ; Fbgn0004169, herein referred to by its synonym TnT ), a process that was previously demonstrated to precisely correlate with quantitative variation in body weight in Lepidoptera and rat. In a similar fashion, hypergravity centrifugation caused fast (i.e. within 24\u2005h) changes to fly leg muscle TnT alternative splicing that correlated with body weight variation across eight D. melanogaster lines. Hypergravity treatment also appeared to enhance leg muscle function, as centrifuged flies showed an increased negative geotaxis response and jump ability. Although the identity and location of the sensors and effectors involved remains unknown, our results provide further support for the existence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that translates signals that encode body weight into appropriate skeletal muscle molecular and functional responses.

Maximum thermal limits were quantified using critical thermal maxima (CT max ) tests following acclimation to either present-day or end-of-century levels of CO 2 for coral reef environments (\u223c500 or \u223c1000\u2005\u00b5atm, respectively). While species differed significantly in their thermal limits, whereby Dischistodus perspicillatus exhibited greater CT max (37.88\u00b10.03\u00b0C; N =47) than Dascyllus aruanus (37.68\u00b10.02\u00b0C; N =85) and Acanthochromis polyacanthus (36.58\u00b10.02\u00b0C; N =63), end-of-century CO 2 had no effect ( D. aruanus ) or a slightly positive effect (increase in CT max of 0.16\u00b0C in D. perspicillatus and 0.21\u00b0C in A. polyacanthus ) on CT max . Contrary to expectations, early-stage juveniles were equally as resilient to CO 2 as larger conspecifics, and CT max was higher at smaller body sizes in two species. These findings suggest that ocean acidification will not impair the maximum thermal limits of reef fishes, and they highlight the critical role of experimental biology in testing predictions of theoretical models forecasting the consequences of environmental change.

McArley PDF ABSTRACT Intertidal fish species face gradual chronic changes in temperature and greater extremes of acute thermal exposure through climate-induced warming. As sea temperatures rise, it has been proposed that whole-animal performance will be impaired through oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance [OCLTT; reduced aerobic metabolic scope (MS)] and, on acute exposure to high temperatures, thermal safety margins may be reduced because of constrained acclimation capacity of upper thermal limits. Using the New Zealand triplefin fish ( Forsterygion lapillum ), this study addressed how performance in terms of growth and metabolism (MS) and upper thermal tolerance limits would be affected by chronic exposure to elevated temperature. Growth was measured in fish acclimated (12\u2005weeks) to present and predicted future temperatures and metabolic rates were then determined in fish at acclimation temperatures and with acute thermal ramping. In agreement with the OCLTT hypothesis, chronic exposure to elevated temperature significantly reduced growth performance and MS. However, despite the prospect of impaired growth performance under warmer future summertime conditions, an annual growth model revealed that elevated temperatures may only shift the timing of high growth potential and not the overall annual growth rate. While the upper thermal tolerance (i.e. critical thermal maxima) increased with exposure to warmer temperatures and was associated with depressed metabolic rates during acute thermal ramping, upper thermal tolerance did not differ between present and predicted future summertime temperatures. This suggests that warming may progressively decrease thermal safety margins for hardy generalist species and could limit the available habitat range of intertidal populations.

The larvae reside in hypo-osmotic freshwater habitats, where they face dilution of their body fluids from osmotic influx of water. The Malpighian tubules help maintain ionic and osmotic homeostasis by removing excess water from the hemolymph; however, the transcellular pathway for this movement remains unresolved. Aquaporins are transmembrane channels thought to permit transcellular transport of water from the hemolymph into the Malpighian tubule lumen. Immunolocalization of A . aegypti aquaporin 5 (AaAQP5) revealed expression by Malpighian tubule principal cells of the larvae, with localization to both the apical and basolateral membranes. Knockdown of AaAQP5 with double-stranded RNA decreased larval survival, reduced rates of fluid, K + and Na + secretion by the Malpighian tubules, and reduced Cl \u2212 concentrations in the hemolymph. These findings indicate that AaAQP5 participates in transcellular water transport across the Malpighian tubules of larval A . aegypti where global AaAQP5 expression is important for larval survival.

Jorgensen PDF ABSTRACT The need for long-axis support is widespread among non-aquatic vertebrates and may be particularly acute for arboreal snakes when many vertebrae span sizable gaps between branches with diverse orientations. Hence, we used brown tree snakes ( Boiga irregularis ) bridging gaps to test how three-dimensional trajectories affected muscle activity and whether these motor patterns differed from those for the locomotion of terrestrial snakes and movements of other vertebrates. We used five trajectories: pitch angles of 90, 0 and \u221290 deg (downward) when yaw=0 deg, and 90 deg yaw angles to the left and right when pitch=0 deg. We recorded movement and electromyograms from the three largest epaxial muscles, which from dorsal to ventral are the semispinalis-spinalis (SSP), longissimus dorsi (LD) and iliocostalis (IL). Overall, the SSP had extensive bilateral activity, which resembled the motor pattern during the dorsiflexion of sidewinding snakes. Unlike any previously described terrestrial snake locomotion, bilateral activity of the LD and IL was also common during gap bridging. The largest amounts of muscle activity usually occurred for horizontal gaps, and muscle activity decreased markedly as soon as the snake's head touched the far edge of the gap. Snakes had the least amount of muscle activity for pitch=\u221290 deg. While turning sideways, muscles on the convex side had less activity when turning compared with the concave side. Hence, the orientation relative to gravity profoundly affected muscle activity during gap bridging, and these complex three-dimensional movements involved several previously undescribed variants of axial motor pattern.

Rodgers PDF ABSTRACT Survival of air-breathing, diving ectotherms is dependent on their capacity to optimise the time available for obligate underwater activities, such as predator avoidance. Submergence times are thermally sensitive, with dive durations significantly reduced by increases in water temperature, deeming these animals particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The physiological mechanisms underlying this compromised performance are unclear but are hypothesised to be linked to increased oxygen demand and a reduced capacity for metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. Here, we investigated how water temperature (both acute and chronic exposures) affected the physiology of juvenile estuarine crocodiles ( Crocodylus porosus ) performing predator avoidance dives (i.e. fright-dives). Diving oxygen consumption, \u2018fright\u2019 bradycardia, haematocrit and haemoglobin (indicators of blood oxygen carrying capacity) were assessed at two test temperatures, reflective of different climate change scenarios (i.e. current summer water temperatures, 28\u00b0C, and \u2018high\u2019 climate warming, 34\u00b0C). Diving oxygen consumption rate increased threefold between 28 and 34\u00b0C ( Q 10 =7.4). The capacity to depress oxygen demand was reduced at elevated temperatures, with animals lowering oxygen demand from surface levels by 52.9\u00b127.8% and 27.8\u00b116.5% (means\u00b1s.e.m.) at 28\u00b0C and 34\u00b0C, respectively. Resting and post-fright-dive haematocrit and haemoglobin were thermally insensitive. Together these findings suggest decrements in fright-dive performance at elevated temperatures stem from increased oxygen demand coupled with a reduced capacity for metabolic depression.

Here, I address the question whether voluntary drinking increases or decreases following the ingestion of food. Increased postprandial drinking implies that food consumption increases rather than decreases the requirement for free water, whereas decreased postprandial drinking suggests there is a net profit of water from food. Snakes are ideally suited for such inquiry because they feed intermittently, and the temporal separation of meals allows relatively clear examination of the associated patterns of pre- and postprandial drinking. Voluntary drinking associated with meal consumption was quantified during consecutive feeding trials in four species representing two families of snakes. Postprandial relative to preprandial drinking increased in all four species, indicating that eating increases the physiological requirement for water. These data add to a growing literature pointing to some generality that eating can have negative rather than positive consequences for fluid homeostasis in some dehydrating animals.

Many primates, including humans, are able to distinguish conspecifics based solely on vocalizations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the acoustic characteristics used by Japanese macaques in individual vocal discrimination. Furthermore, we tested human subjects using monkey vocalizations to evaluate species specificity with respect to such discriminations. Two monkeys and five humans were trained to discriminate the coo calls of two unfamiliar monkeys. We created a stimulus continuum between the vocalizations of the two monkeys as a set of probe stimuli (whole morph). We also created two sets of continua in which only one acoustic parameter, fundamental frequency ( f 0 ) or vocal tract characteristic (VTC), was changed from the coo call of one monkey to that of another while the other acoustic feature remained the same ( f 0 morph and VTC morph, respectively). According to the results, the reaction times both of monkeys and humans were correlated with the morph proportion under the whole morph and f 0 morph conditions. The reaction time to the VTC morph was correlated with the morph proportion in both monkeys, whereas the reaction time in humans, on average, was not correlated with morph proportion. Japanese monkeys relied more consistently on VTC than did humans for discriminating monkey vocalizations. Our results support the idea that the auditory system of primates is specialized for processing conspecific vocalizations and suggest that VTC is a significant acoustic feature used by Japanese macaques to discriminate conspecific vocalizations. INTRODUCTION Most primates, including humans, can distinguish the voices of different conspecifics. Previous studies have shown that common squirrel monkey ( Saimiri sciureus ; Kaplan et al., 1978 ), vervet monkey ( Chlorocebus pygerythrus ; Cheney and Seyfarth, 1980 ), Japanese monkey ( Macaca fuscata ; Pereira, 1986 ) and rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ; Jovanovic et al., 2000 ) mothers could distinguish the voices of their own infants from those of other juvenile individuals. Pygmy marmosets discriminated vocalizations of other group members ( Snowdon and Cleveland, 1980 ). Another study showed that rhesus macaques were able to discriminate species-specific vocalizations of kin from those of non-kin ( Rendall et al., 1996 ). Taken together, these studies indicate that the identification of individuals by their vocalizations is important in many primates. The acoustic characteristics used by primates to discriminate conspecific individuals have been investigated. Owren et al. (1997) analyzed the vocalizations of female chacma baboons ( Papio ursinus ) and reported that the acoustic features of vocal tract filtering may reflect individuality. Bachorowski and Owren (1999) analyzed phonemes in the speech of humans and showed that vocal tract filtering may contribute to the identification of individuals. The resonance of vocal tract characteristics (VTC) may affect individual identification in rhesus macaques ( Rendall et al., 1998 ), lemurs ( Gamba et al., 2012 ) and Japanese macaques ( Furuyama et al., 2016 ). Statistical analyses have shown that the acoustic features of the fundamental frequency ( f 0 ), such as the beginning frequency and the maximum frequency, in addition to the formants, can be a reliable cue for identifying callers in several monkey species ( Smith et al., 1982 ; Snowdon et al., 1983 ). The species-specific communication sound, called the \u2018coo call\u2019, of Japanese macaques was used in the present study. Green (1975) classified the vocalizations of Japanese macaques in the field and showed that monkeys possessed several types of call. Since then, many other research groups have also focused on their vocalization behavior. Coo calls have both a clear f 0 and rich harmonics, and the calls are important for social interactions. Monkeys vocalize coo calls when they approach other individuals closely for grooming ( Mori, 1975 ). Brown et al. (1979) showed that monkeys could distinguish sound localizations using coo calls. The monkeys exchange coo calls with each other ( Mitani, 1986 ), and match the f 0 of their reply with that of the preceding calls ( Sugiura, 1998 ). Japanese macaques vocalize greeting calls (coo calls, grunts and girneys) together with increased social interactions when they approach unrelated females ( Katsu et al., 2014 ). In a previous study, we investigated the acoustic features used for individual discrimination using synthetic coo calls that had the same f 0 ( Furuyama et al., 2016 ). In natural observations, however, the f 0 varied among individuals when they uttered spontaneous vocalizations ( Mitani, 1986 ; Sugiura, 1998 ). In the present study, we investigated the acoustic features ( f 0 and VTC) used by Japanese macaques and human subjects for discriminating monkey vocalizations with differing f 0 and VTC. We used standard go/no-go operant conditioning and speech processing techniques to systematically compare the perceptual contributions of different acoustic features of monkey vocalizations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects Two male Japanese macaques (monkeys 1 and 2; 7 and 10 years old, respectively, at the time of testing) and five male humans (22\u201323\u2005years old) participated in these experiments. Each monkey was housed individually in a primate cage under a constant 13 h:11 h light:dark cycle. Access to liquids was limited because water served as a positive reinforcement in the experiments. All experiments were conducted in accordance with guidelines approved by the Animal Experimental Committee of Doshisha University, Japan and the Ethics Board of Doshisha University. Apparatus All training and tests were conducted in a sound-attenuated room (length\u00d7width\u00d7height: 1.70\u00d71.85\u00d72.65\u2005m). In the experiments involving the monkeys, the subjects were seated in a monkey chair equipped with a drinking tube and a response lever. In the experiments involving human subjects, the same lever was attached to a desk, and the subject was seated in a standard laboratory chair in front of the desk. A loudspeaker (SX-WD1KT; Victor, Tokyo, Japan) driven by an amplifier (SRP-P2400; Sony, Tokyo, Japan) was positioned 58\u2005cm in front of the subject's head at the same height as the ears. The frequency response of the speaker characteristics was flattened (\u00b13\u2005dB) between 0.4 and 16\u2005kHz using a graphic equalizer (GQ2015A; Yamaha, Hamamatsu, Japan). A white-light-emitting diode (LED) and a charge-coupled device (CCD) video camera were attached to the top of the speaker. The LED was lit during the training and test sessions for lighting, and subjects were monitored using the CCD camera. Acoustic stimuli Coo calls from two monkeys that were not familiar to monkeys 1 and 2 [monkey A (cooA) and monkey B (cooB)] were recorded as sound stimuli in a sound-attenuated room (1.70\u00d71.85\u00d72.65\u2005m) using a digital audio tape recorder (TCD-D8; Sony) and a condenser microphone [range of frequency response (\u00b13\u2005dB): 3\u201320,000 Hz; type 7046, Aco, Tokyo, Japan] at a sampling rate of 44.1\u2005kHz and a resolution of 16 bits. The subjects (both monkeys and humans) did not hear the voices of the stimulus monkeys prior to the experiment. Fourteen coo calls (seven from each monkey) with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 40\u2005dB were selected randomly from the recorded sounds for use as stimuli. Recorded coo calls ( Fig. 1 A) were analyzed using a digital-signal-processing package (STRAIGHT; Kawahara et al., 1999 ) to measure three acoustic parameters: the f 0 ( Fig. 1 B), VTC (the frequency structure corresponding primarily to the resonance characteristics of the vocal tract; Fig. 1 C,D) and the durations of the coo calls. Twelve coo calls (six per individual) of the total of fourteen were used as training stimuli (cooAs and cooBs). One coo call from each monkey (cooA and cooB) was not played during training and was used to synthesize a test stimulus. Three continuum stimuli of coo calls were created using STRAIGHT. The program was used to break down a coo call into two acoustic parameters ( f 0 and VTC), which allowed us to manipulate the parameters independently. For example, we might synthesize a coo call from 30% of the information from monkey A (i.e. cooA) and 70% of the information from monkey B (i.e. cooB) into one acoustic parameter (e.g. f 0 ) while using no information from monkey A in another parameter (e.g. VTC). A stimulus continuum, defined as a whole morph, consisting of cooA and cooB, was created to comprise 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90% of cooB ( Fig. 2 A, Audio 1 ). Each stimulus in the continuum contained equal contributions from the f 0 and VTC from cooB. We created two additional sets of stimulus continua in which only one acoustic parameter, f 0 or VTC, was changed from cooA to cooB, whereas the other acoustic feature remained the same as monkey B's original. One stimulus continuum, defined as the f 0 morph, was created to comprise 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90% of the f 0 from cooB ( Fig. 2 B, Audio 2 ); the other, defined as the VTC morph, comprised 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90% of the VTC from monkey B ( Fig. 2 C, Audio 3 ). Three different sound pressure level (SPL) stimuli were created for each stimulus type: 57, 60 and 63\u2005dB SPL (re. 20 \u03bcPa). All stimulus amplitudes were modified digitally and calibrated (using a microphone; type 7016, Aco). The call durations were equalized to 517\u2005ms (the average of all calls) via linear time-stretching or -compressing using STRAIGHT. Download powerpoint Fig. 1. Acoustic features of coo calls.

In B and C, the designated acoustic feature was morphed between cooA and cooB, whereas the other feature remained constant (i.e. as cooB). Procedure Standard go/no-go operant conditioning was used. Fig. 3 shows the schematized event sequence of the trials. Subjects were required to press the lever switch on the monkey chair to begin the trial. Then, coo calls from the same subject, monkey A or monkey B, were presented randomly three to seven times. In the repetition, call types were selected randomly from 18 types of stimulus (one individual\u00d7six types of coo calls\u00d7three intensities). The interstimulus interval between adjacent stimuli was 800\u2005ms. While the calls from the same monkey were presented (no-go trial), subjects were required to continue pressing the lever. When the stimulus was changed from one monkey to another (go trial), subjects were required to release the lever within 800\u2005ms from the offset of the stimulus. For example, a trial was started using the repeated playback of cooAs (no-go stimulus). In the repetition, the cooA type (out of six) and the stimulus intensity (out of three: 57, 60 and 63\u2005dB SPL) were changed randomly. The subjects were required to continue pressing the lever while cooA was repeated [correct rejection (CR)]. When cooB (go stimulus) was presented, the subjects were required to release the lever within 800\u2005ms after the offset of cooB (hit). Hits were reinforced by fruit juice (2\u2005ml). When the subjects released the lever during the repetition period of the no-go stimulus (false alarm) or failed to release the lever within 800\u2005ms after the go stimulus (miss), a 5- to 10-s timeout period accompanied by turning off the LED was provided as feedback. When the subjects responded successfully to the go stimulus, the stimulus contingencies were reversed in the next trial. That is, the next trial was started using a playback of cooB instead of cooA, and the subject had to release the lever when cooA was played to receive the reward. Download powerpoint Fig. 3. Schematized trial event sequence. Top: timing of the stimulus. Middle: response of the animal. Bottom: timing of the reward. Black hexagon: cooA; white hexagon: cooB. The subjects were required to press a lever to begin the trial. Then, cooA was presented three to seven times with an interstimulus interval of 800\u2005ms. The subjects were required to continue pressing the lever while cooA was repeated. When cooB (go stimulus) was presented, the subjects were required to release the lever within 800\u2005ms after the offset of cooB to receive a reward. After a correct response to a go stimulus, the stimulus contingencies were reversed in the next trial. That is, cooA became the go stimulus, and cooB became the no-go stimulus. In the test trial, a test stimulus was presented after cooB, repeated three to seven times. Neither a reward nor a punishment followed a test trial. ISI, interstimulus interval; RP, response period. Performance was measured by the correct response percentage (CRP; total percentage of hits and CRs). In total, 130\u2013180 go trials (trials in which the stimulus changed from one monkey to the other) and 800\u20131000 no-go trials were presented per day to both subjects. After the monkey's scores exceeded the CRP threshold (75%), the subject proceeded to the test session. Test trials were conducted approximately every 10\u201320 training trials. A test stimulus was presented after cooB, repeated three to seven times, and each type of test stimulus was played six times. Neither a reward nor a punishment followed a test trial. For the human subjects, no juice was given as a reward in the trials, and a CRP of 90% was used as the threshold for proceeding to the test session. Test trials were conducted every five to ten training trials, and each type of test stimulus was presented five times. Data analysis We measured the go response rates and reaction times between the end of each stimulus and the release of the lever switch. The d \u2032 sensitivity values were calculated from the signal detection theory ( Green and Swets, 1966 ) by subtracting z -score (normal deviates) of \u2018false alarm\u2019 rates from z -score of \u2018hit\u2019 rates. The coefficient of correlation (Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient) between reaction times and sets of continuum stimuli were calculated using commercial statistics software (SPSS; IBM, NY, USA). RESULTS Training results in each subject Monkeys 1 and 2 required 20 and 21\u2005days of training, respectively, to distinguish between the sets of cooA and cooB. Two days before the test day, the monkeys scored CRPs of 85% (monkey 1: d \u2032=1.81) and 91% (monkey 2: d \u2032=2.48). One day before the test day, the CRPs were 85% (monkey 1: d \u2032=1.89) and 86% (monkey 2: d \u2032=2.09). The CRPs for all human subjects were >90% during the training sessions. During the test period, the CRPs to training stimuli were >75% in both monkeys [monkey 1: 86% ( d \u2032=1.82); monkey 2: 87% ( d \u2032=2.09)] and >90% in all humans [human 1: 98% ( d \u2032=4.26); human 2: 99% ( d \u2032=4.78); human 3: 99% ( d \u2032=5.29); human 4: 98% ( d \u2032=4.14); human 5: 99% ( d \u2032=4.38)]. The CRPs during the test period did not differ from those during the training sessions, and the corresponding d \u2032 sensitivity values remained higher than 1.8. The d \u2032 sensitivity value was comparable to several previous studies using rhesus monkeys (e.g. Hage and Nieder, 2013 ). These results indicate that the subjects maintained the same discriminatory performance they showed in response to the training stimuli throughout the experiment. In addition, we did not find any significant correlation between CRP and the number of no-go stimuli repeated before the go stimulus (monkey 1: r =0.39, P =0.36; monkey 2: r =0.24, P =0.59). Morphed stimuli between cooA and cooB: whole morph The go response rates to the whole-morph stimulus continuum (whole morph) are shown in Fig. 4 A (top panel). The go response rates of monkey 1 and humans decreased gradually as a function of the increasing morph proportion of test cooB, but that of monkey 2 did not decrease. The go response rate of monkey 1 decreased to <50% when the morphing proportions increased to >70%. In humans, the average go response rates decreased to <50% when the morphing proportions increased to >50%. Download powerpoint Fig. 4. Go response rates and reaction times to the test stimuli.

The reaction times of both monkeys and humans increased gradually with the increase in the morphing proportion ( Table 1 ). A significant positive correlation was observed between the morphing proportions of cooB and the reaction times to the stimuli in both monkeys and humans (Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients, monkey 1: r s =0.62, n =42, P <0.001; monkey 2: r s =0.55, n =42, P <0.001; humans: r s =0.78, n =35, P <0.001). Both monkeys and humans pressed the lever longer as the stimulus became more similar to test cooB. View this table: The median reaction times to whole-morph stimuli in each subject Morphed f 0 continuum results The go response rates of monkey 1 and humans decreased gradually with the increase in the morphing proportion of the f 0 from test cooB, but that of monkey 2 did not decrease ( Fig. 4 B). The go response rates of monkey 1 decreased to <50% when the morphing proportion of the f 0 from test cooB increased to >30%. In humans, the go response rates decreased to <50% when the morphing proportions increased to >50%. The reaction times to the f 0 morph are depicted in Fig. 4 B and Table 2 . The reaction times for subjects (in the two monkeys and the humans on average) increased as the proportion of the f 0 from test cooB increased (monkey 1: r s =0.50, n =30, P =0.005; monkey 2: r s =0.46, n =30, P =0.01; humans: r s =0.48, n =25, P =0.015). The reaction times of three humans correlated with the morphing rates of f 0 morphs (human 1: r s =0.80, n =25, P <0.001; human 2: r s =0.54, n =25, P =0.005; human 4: r s =0.71, n =25, P <0.001; Table 2 ). Both monkeys and humans pressed the lever longer as the f 0 -morph stimuli became more similar to test cooB. View this table: The median reaction times to both f 0 -morph and VTC-morph in all subjects Morphed VTC continuum results The go response rate of monkey 1 decreased with the increase in the morphing proportion of the VTC from test cooB, whereas that of monkey 2 did not decrease systematically and remained >50% ( Fig. 4 C). For monkey 1, the go response rate decreased to <50% when the morphing proportions of the VTC of test cooB increased to >70%. In humans, the go response rates remained <50% regardless of the morphing proportion in the VTC morph. The reaction times to the VTC morph are depicted in Fig. 4 C and Table 2 . The reaction times of both monkeys increased significantly as the contribution of test cooB to the VTC increased (monkey 1: r s =0.71, n =30, P <0.001; monkey 2: r s =0.40, n =30, P <0.027). By contrast, on average, the median reaction time in humans did not correlate significantly with the morphing rates of VTC morphs (humans: r s =0.33, n =25, P =0.11) and remained constant over the VTC morph continuum. However, the reaction times of two humans correlated with the morphing rates of VTC morphs (human 2: r s =0.48, n =25, P =0.018; human 4: r s =0.47, n =25, P =0.018; Table 2 ), whereas their correlation coefficients for the f 0 morph were higher than those of VTC morph ( Table 2 ). Fig. 5 shows the distributions of correlation coefficients in the f 0 and VTC morphs. To evaluate the species difference, we plotted the correlation coefficients for f 0 and VTC morphs in Fig. 5 . The ranges of correlation coefficients for the f 0 morphs were 0.46\u20130.50 in monkeys and 0.27\u20130.80 in humans. The range of correlation coefficients for the VTC morph were 0.40\u20130.71 in monkeys and 0.00\u20130.48 in humans. Download powerpoint Fig. 5. Distribution of correlation coefficients for f 0 -morph and VTC-morph stimuli in each subject. M: monkey; H: human. Correlation coefficients of reaction times to f 0 -morph and VTC-morph stimuli were calculated using Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient. DISCUSSION With all continuum stimuli, the go response rates for monkey 1 and humans decreased with the increase in the morph proportion, whereas monkey 2's go response rates to the test stimuli remained relatively high (>50%; Fig. 4 ). Although both monkeys went through the same training regime, they seemed to use a different behavioral strategy. Monkey 1 released the lever (go response) less often as the probe stimulus more highly resembled the no-go stimulus ( Fig. 4 A), suggesting that it adjusted the go response rate according to the perceptual similarity between the test stimuli and learned stimulus set. By contrast, monkey 2 almost always released the lever to any probe stimulus, including test cooB (i.e. 100% whole morph), suggesting that it was able to discriminate test cooB from trained cooBs. In other words, test cooB and trained cooBs were perceptually different enough to evoke go responses for monkey 2. The d \u2032 analysis showed that monkey 2 exhibited better discrimination than monkey 1; the perceptual difference could partially reflect the response difference to test cooB. Both monkeys, however, showed longer reaction times as the probe stimulus resembled the test cooB ( Fig. 4 A), indicating that call perception systematically changed along the stimulus continuum. Taken together, our data, except for the go response rate of monkey 2, suggest that subjects responded to the high morph proportion more similarly to how they responded to cooB than to cooA. Several studies have indicated that the vocalizations of monkeys can be modified using STRAIGHT. Previously, the vocal tract lengths of rhesus monkeys were increased or decreased virtually using this software ( Ghazanfar et al., 2007 ). Chakladar et al. (2008) demonstrated that the vocalizations of different macaque individuals could be morphed using this software, and the quality of the morphs was evaluated by human listeners. In the present study, the time taken by both monkeys and humans to release the lever increased gradually with an increase in the morph proportion ( Fig. 4 ). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a stimulus continuum synthesized with STRAIGHT that was applied to monkey subjects and demonstrated that the stimuli systematically affected the perception of individuals. The stimulus continuum has been used to investigate the detailed nature of perception and has been especially valuable in evaluating categorical perceptions ( Kuhl and Padden, 1983 ; Miyawaki et al., 1975 ; Sinnott et al., 1976 ; Sinnott and Adams, 1987 ; Sinnott and Brown, 1997 ). A common feature in categorical perception is that the subject is more sensitive to a physical transition between two perceptual categories than to the same change occurring within a category. This has typically been measured using a combination of both a discrimination task involving adjacent stimulus pairs (e.g. 10 versus 30% morphed) in a stimulus continuum and an identification task along the continuum. Using our stimulus scheme, future research can examine how monkeys categorize vocalizations of different conspecifics. We investigated the acoustic features used for individual discrimination using continuum stimuli. The reaction times of both monkeys and humans increased gradually with the increase in the morphing proportion involving the f 0 morph ( Fig. 4 B), suggesting that, on average, both monkeys and humans used the f 0 as a discriminative stimulus. Several monkey species have been shown to discriminate vocalizations using the f 0 in natural and experimental settings. This is consistent with the present results. The temporal structures of the f 0 of Japanese macaques\u2019 coo calls have been regarded as having behavioral significance because the monkeys modify the temporal structure depending on the situation ( Green, 1975 ). Trained Japanese macaques showed an ability to discriminate the peak positions of natural tonal vocalizations ( Zoloth et al., 1979 ). Monkeys may categorically discriminate the temporal structures of the f 0 ( May et al., 1989 ). Additionally, monkeys distinguish the synthetic vocalizations of conspecifics using the peak positions of the f 0 ( Hopp et al., 1992 ). In related research, Japanese macaques were trained to discriminate the vocalizations of different monkeys, and the subjects responded to the f 0 as a discriminant stimulus for the task, suggesting that the f 0 contributed to individual discrimination ( Ceugniet and Izumi, 2004 ). Overall, the f 0 plays a significant role in the vocal communication of many species of monkeys, including Japanese macaques. Our monkeys also used the f 0 in our experimental setting. In our stimulus set, the mean frequencies of cooB were higher, by about 350\u2005Hz or 68%, than those of cooA [cooA: 519\u00b150\u2005Hz (mean\u00b1s.d.), cooB: 875\u00b1121\u2005Hz; Fig. 1 B]; the sensitivities of difference limits for frequency in monkeys and humans have been reported to be 14\u201333\u2005Hz and 2.4\u20134.8\u2005Hz, respectively ( Prosen et al., 1990 ; Sinnott et al., 1985 ), suggesting that the average f 0 alone can readily serve as a discriminative stimulus for both species. Additionally, the f 0 of the cooA peak was earlier than that of the cooB peak by \u223c60\u2005ms (the peak position of the vocalizations: 95\u00b122\u2005ms for monkey A and 134\u00b145\u2005ms for monkey B). Japanese macaques and humans have shown the ability to distinguish changes in the peak position as small as 20\u201350\u2005ms ( Hopp et al., 1992 ), indicating that the temporal structure of the f 0 can also function as a discriminative stimulus in both species. Thus, the f 0 was such that both monkeys and humans could use it as a key to distinguish the stimulus sets. Both monkeys took significantly longer to respond as the morphing proportion of the VTC morph increased ( Fig. 4 C). The results showed that monkeys used the formant frequencies, in addition to the f 0 , as discriminative stimuli for the stimulus sets. It has been shown that formants are biologically significant for the vocal communication of many primate species. In human speech, vocal tract length is necessary to classify individual speakers ( Bachorowski and Owren, 1999 ). The resonances of the vocal tract have physical characteristics in baboons ( Owren et al., 1997 ; Rendall, 2003 ). Owren (1990) showed that formants were used to distinguish alarm calls in a manner similar to that used by humans for discriminating speech. Similar to humans, trained Japanese macaques show great sensitivity to different formant frequencies ( Sommers et al., 1992 ). Non-human primates are able to discriminate formant changes in species-specific vocalizations ( Fitch and Fritz, 2006 ). One study using a preferential looking paradigm with non-trained monkeys showed that the index characteristics of age-related size were embedded in the formants of monkeys ( Ghazanfar et al., 2007 ). Taken together, these results were consistent with the present results, as formant information played an important role in vocal communication, and the monkeys used the information to discriminate the stimulus sets. In contrast, human behavioral data showed that the mean reaction times and go response rates did not change systematically as the morphing proportion of the VTC morph increased ( Fig. 4 C). These results indicated that, unlike the monkeys, the humans, on average, did not use the formant frequency as a key to discriminate the stimulus sets. This difference might stem from differences in auditory sensitivity. Japanese macaques have better high-frequency (i.e. >8\u2005kHz) hearing than do humans ( Heffner, 2004 ). The power spectrum peak at 10\u2005kHz of cooA, the most distinct feature differentiating the stimulus sets ( Fig. 1 ), could be more salient to monkeys than to humans. Thus, the VTC had a greater effect on the monkeys than on the humans. Another explanation, which does not necessarily contradict that of auditory sensitivity, involves a difference in auditory processing. Previous studies have shown that humans are more sensitive than are monkeys to the discrimination of formant transitions, although monkeys are able to distinguish linguistic sounds ( Sinnott et al., 1976 ; Sinnott and Brown, 1997 ). Another study compared differences in the sensitivity of humans and monkeys using a continuum of voice onset time (VOT) in English; it was suggested that the sensitivity with which pairs of syllables can be discriminated in VOT was less in monkeys than in humans ( Sinnott and Adams, 1987 ). Our behavioral data indicated that the auditory system of monkeys is specialized to process their vocalizations, especially the biologically significant acoustic cue of their VTC. Our previous study used synthetic coo calls to evaluate the acoustic features used for individual recognition, and the mean f 0 of the vocalization stimulus was equalized to the same frequency, whereas the temporal modulation of the f 0 was unchanged. The results suggested that VTC is more important than the temporal structures of the f 0 for discriminating individuals ( Furuyama et al., 2016 ). In field studies, however, the f 0 of the spontaneous vocalizations of Japanese monkeys differed by 300\u20131000\u2005Hz between individuals ( Mitani, 1986 ; Sugiura, 1998 ). In the present study, we used stimulus sets that differed in f 0 by \u223c350\u2005Hz (cooA: 519\u00b150\u2005Hz; cooB: 875\u00b1121\u2005Hz; Fig. 1 B), which is comparable to natural individual differences. The current results, together with those of our previous study, suggest that monkeys used both the f 0 and VTC to discriminate individuals and that they can adjust their reliance on the f 0 depending on the stimulus. The distributions of correlation coefficients differed between monkeys and humans ( Fig. 5 ), but the correlation coefficients of the two monkeys were similarly distributed. Thus, the monkeys used the f 0 and VTC to discriminate the vocalizations of a monkey in a relatively similar way. By contrast, the distributions of correlation coefficients differed among the human subjects. For example, two humans (humans 1 and 5) used only the f 0 , whereas three humans (humans 2, 3 and 4) used both the f 0 and VTC to distinguish the caller monkey. Interestingly, the reaction times of human 2 in both the f 0 morph and VTC morph were similar to those of monkeys rather than those of other human subjects ( Fig. 4 bottom, and Fig. 5 ), suggesting that some humans are capable of discriminating the monkey vocalization as monkeys do. As a whole, each human may have used a different strategy in utilizing acoustic cues (i.e. f 0 or VTC) to discriminate the monkey vocalization. We investigated only males as human subjects in this experiment. As our results show, males on average did not depend on formant frequencies to discriminate monkey vocalizations. Previous study of humans showed that males were more sensitive than females in distinguishing acoustic size by using formant frequencies of synthesized human voices ( Charlton et al., 2013 ). If this sex difference holds in perception of heterospecific vocalizations (i.e. monkey voice), the human (average of female and male) might rely on formant frequencies even less in discriminating monkey vocalizations than present data imply. However, further study is needed to obtain a more complete picture of the species difference. This species difference in how strongly and consistently they relied on VTC for the purpose of discrimination might stem from differences in auditory processes. Many neurophysiological studies have shown that primates develop brain mechanisms specialized for processing conspecific vocalizations. In studies with non-human primates, neurons in the auditory cortex also responded to species-specific vocalizations rather than to both non-vocal stimuli ( Winter and Funkenstein, 1973 ) and synthetic vocalizations that were spectro-temporal structures changed based on natural vocalizations ( Wang et al., 1995 ). Another study showed that the left temporal cortex, including the auditory cortex, was necessary for Japanese macaques to discriminate different types of conspecific vocalizations ( Heffner and Heffner, 1984 ). It has also been shown that interhemispheric interactions create a conspecific-vocalization-specific response in the left hemisphere ( Poremba et al., 2004 ). A recent study demonstrated that the brain activities in the superior temporal plane responded selectively not only to species-specific vocalizations but also to the identity of conspecific individuals ( Petkov et al., 2008 ). Our results reinforce the idea that primates have a cognitive faculty for processing conspecific vocalizations, and suggest that VTC could be one of the most important acoustic features that the monkey auditory system has to deal with.

Stress in animals is usually determined by the levels of stress-related hormones. A big challenge, however, is in determining the history of exposure of an organism to stress, because the release of stress hormones can show an acute (and recent) but not a sustained exposure to stress. Epigenetic tools provide an alternative option to evaluate past exposure to long-term stress. Chickens provide a unique model to study stress effects in the epigenome of red blood cells (RBCs), a cell type of easy access and nucleated in birds. The present study investigated whether two different rearing conditions in chickens can be identified by looking at DNA methylation patterns in their RBCs later in life. These conditions were rearing in open aviaries versus in cages, which are likely to differ regarding the amount of stress they generate. Our comparison revealed 115 genomic windows with significant changes in RBC DNA methylation between experimental groups, which were located around 53 genes and within 22 intronic regions. Our results set the ground for future detection of long-term stress in live production animals by measuring DNA methylation in a cell type of easy accessibility.

We evaluated the function of these and other peculiar desmognathine cranial features in biting by examining the morphology, mechanics and in vivo biting performance of the large Desmognathus quadramaculatus . We estimated theoretical biting force using a novel geometric method that we describe. Results provide quantitative evidence to bolster earlier conclusions that the unusual atlanto-mandibular ligaments couple ventral head flexion, a unique desmognathine behavior, with biting performance. Our analysis also reveals that the ligaments not only transmit, but also amplify the force of head flexion when acting together with the unusual stalked occipital condyles, enlarged atlas and massive quadratopectoralis muscles. The geometric model predicts that this mechanism contributes five times the biting force of the three jaw levator muscles combined and predicts that maximum biting force in D. quadramaculatus matches or exceeds forces reported for similarly sized lizards. The i n vivo biting performance we measured was several times greater in D. quadramaculatus than another plethodontid salamander, Pseudotriton ruber , which lacks the unusual morphology and mechanism of desmognathines. The effective biting mechanism of D. quadramaculatus we describe is an emergent property of many of the distinguishing morphological features of desmognathine salamanders and likely plays an important role in their natural history given that desmognathines use biting in feeding, defense and even courtship.

Pathogen manipulation of the host-seeking behaviour of vectors towards susceptible hosts is supposedly beneficial for transmission. For West Nile virus (WNV), manipulation of the host-seeking behaviour of the main mosquito vector towards birds would be advantageous, because mammals are dead-end hosts. We hypothesised that WNV infection induces a stronger host-seeking response and a shift in host preference towards birds, to enhance its transmission by mosquitoes. However, here we show that WNV infection decreases the host-seeking response, and does not induce a shift in mosquito host preference. Other fitness-related traits are not affected by WNV infection. No effect of WNV infection was found on antennal electrophysiological responsiveness. Thus, the reduced host-seeking response is likely to result from interference in the mosquito's central nervous system. This is the first study that shows changes, specifically in the host-seeking behaviour induced by a pathogen, that do not favour transmission.

Theoretically, different excavation strategies can be used. Mole-rats could either use their head depressor muscles to power scooping motions of the upper incisors (by nose-down head rotations) or the lower incisors (by nose-up head rotations), or their jaw adductors to grab and break the soil after penetrating both sets of incisors into the ground, or a combination of these mechanisms. To identify how chisel-tooth digging works, a kinematic analysis of this behaviour was performed based on high-speed videos of 19 individuals from the African mole-rat species Fukomys micklemi placed inside transparent tubes in a laboratory setting. Our analysis showed that the soil is penetrated by both the upper and lower incisors at a relatively high gape angle, generally with the head rotated nose-up. Initially, the upper incisors remain approximately stationary to function as an anchor to allow an upward movement of the lower incisors to grab the soil. Next, a quick, nose-down rotation of the head further detaches the soil and drops the soil below the head. Consequently, both jaw adduction and head depression are jointly used to power tooth-digging in F. micklemi . The same mechanism, but with longer digging cycles, and soil being thrown down at smaller gape sizes, was used when digging in harder soil.

Involved in many daily activities, grasping has been extensively studied in primates and other mammals. Yet, other groups of tetrapods, including anurans, have also evolved significant forelimb prehensile capacities that are often thought to have originated in an arboreal context. However, grasping is also observed in aquatic species. Yet, how aquatic frogs use their forelimbs to capture and manipulate prey remains largely unknown. The aim of this study is to explore how the grasping and manipulation of food items in aquatic frogs is impacted by food properties such as size and mobility. To do so we use the aquatic frog Xenopus laevis and quantified the use of the hands and fingers while processing mobile and stationary prey of different sizes (small, intermediate, and large prey). Our results show that X. laevis is able to individualize the digits and that the mobility and the length of the prey significantly influence the kind of grasping pattern used. Grasping abilities are thus not specific to terrestrial, nor arboreal species. These results illustrate how prey properties impact grasping and manipulation strategies in an aquatic frog and shed further light on the ecological contexts that may have given rise to the origin of grasping in frogs.

Golovko PDF Abstract The mechanisms of action potential (AP) generation in the myoepithelial cells of the Tunicata heart are not yet well understood. Here, an attempt was made to elucidate these mechanisms by analyzing the effects of specific blockers of K + , Na + and Ca 2+ currents on the configuration of transmembrane APs and their frequency in the spontaneously beating ascidian heart. In addition, an immunocytochemical analysis of heart myoepithelial cells was performed. Staining with anti-FMRF-amide and anti-tubulin antibodies did not reveal any nerve elements within the heart tube. Treatment with 1 mM TEA ( I K blocker) resulted in depolarization of heart cell sarcolemma by 10 mV, and inhibition of APs generation was recorded after 3-three min exposure. Prior to this moment, the frequency of APs generation in a burst decreased from 16\u201318 to 2 beats per min due to prolongation of the diastole. After application of ivabradine (3 or 10 \u00b5M), the spontaneous APs generation frequency decreased by 24%. Based on these results and published data, it is concluded that the key role in the automaticity of the ascidian heart is played by the outward K + currents, Na + currents, activated hyperpolarization current I f , and a current of unknown nature I X .

Nord\u00f8y PDF Abstract The aim of the study was to monitor seasonal changes in stable isotopes of pool freshwater, and harp seal ( Phoca groenlandica ) body water, and to study if these potential seasonal changes might bias results of using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method when measuring energy expenditure in animals with access to fresh water. Seasonal changes in the background levels of deuterium and oxygen-18 in the body water of four captive harp seals and in the freshwater pool in which they were kept, were measured over a time period of one year. The seals were offered daily amounts of capelin and kept under a seasonal photoperiod of 69\u00b0 N. Large seasonal variations of deuterium and oxygen-18 in the pool water was measured, and the isotope abundance in body water showed similar seasonal changes as the pool water. This shows that the seals were continuously equilibrating with surrounding water due to significant daily water drinking. Variations in background levels of deuterium and oxygen-18 in freshwater sources may be due to seasonal changes in physical processes such as precipitation and evaporation that may cause fractionation of isotopes. Rapid and abrupt changes in the background levels of deuterium and oxygen-18 may complicate calculation of energy expenditure by use of the DLW method. It is therefore strongly recommended to perform analysis of seasonal changes in background levels of isotopes before the DLW method is applied on (free-ranging) animals, and to use a control group in order to correct for changes in background levels.

Adaptive phenotypic responses induced by heterogeneous temperatures have been shown to be mediated by molecular pathways independent of the classic heat shock responses, however, an in-depth understanding of plasticity induced by fluctuating temperatures is still lacking. We investigated high and low temperature acclimation induced by fluctuating thermal regimes at two different mean temperatures, at two different amplitudes of fluctuation and across the developmental and adult life stages. For developmental acclimation, we found mildly detrimental effects of high amplitude fluctuations for critical thermal minima, while the critical thermal maxima showed a beneficial response to higher amplitude fluctuations. For adult acclimation involving shifts between fluctuating and constant regimes, cold tolerance was shown to be dictated by developmental temperature conditions irrespective of the adult treatments, while the acquired heat tolerance was readily lost when flies developed at fluctuating temperature were shifted to a constant regime as adults. Interestingly, we also found that effect of fluctuations at any life stage was gradually lost with prolonged adult maintenance suggesting a more prominent effect of fluctuations during developmental compared to adult acclimation in Drosophila melanogaster .

Among the sound-generating fish, Gobiidae, a large fish taxa with 1866 valid species, is one of the most studied groups of acoustic fishes with sound production being documented in a number of species. Paradoxically, the sound producing mechanism remains poorly studied in this group. The painted goby Pomatoschistus pictus produces two distinct sounds called drums and thumps. A combination of morphological and experimental analyses involving high-speed videos synchronized with sound recordings supports that drums are produced during lateral head movements involving at least the alternate contractions of the muscles levator pectoralis originating on the skull and inserting on the pectoral girdle. These movements are reported in many Gobiidae species suggesting the pectoral-girdle based mechanism is common in the clade and could have evolved from locomotory movements.

This has recently been called into question by members of the scientific community based on reviews of published literature. Using pond turtles ( Trachemys scripta elegans ), hypothermia as a method for anesthesia to precede euthanasia by decapitation was assessed. Turtles were subjected to hypothermia using a cooling followed by freezing protocol. Body temperature measurements ranged between \u22121 to \u22122\u00b0C while core body temperature was \u22121\u00b0C. Ice crystal formation was never observed. A protective reflex to noxious stimuli, the eyeblink response, was recorded from in vitro brainstem preparations subjected to cold. At 5\u20136\u00b0C, reflex responses were suppressed, demonstrating minimal synaptic transmission in brain circuits above temperatures used for hypothermia induction. These and previous data indicate that a re-evaluation of the use of hypothermia as an anesthetic in amphibians and reptiles is warranted.

The likelihood of transition from one behavioral pattern to another is malleable by experience and confers flexibility to the behavioral repertoire. Experience-dependent modification of innate aggressive behavior in flies alters fighting strategies during fights and establishes dominant-subordinate relationships. Dominance hierarchies resulting from agonistic encounters are consolidated to longer lasting social status-dependent behavioral modifications resulting in a robust loser effect. We show that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dynamics regulated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, Rut and the cAMP phosphodiesterase, Dnc but not the Amn gene product, in specific neuronal groups of the mushroom body and central complex, mediate behavioral plasticity necessary to establish dominant-subordinate relationships. rut and dnc mutant flies are unable to alter fighting strategies and establish dominance relationships during agonistic interactions. This real-time flexibility during a fight is independent of changes in aggression levels. Longer-term consolidation of social status in the form of a loser effect, however, requires additional Amn -dependent inputs to cAMP signaling and involves a circuit-level association between the \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b3 neurons of the mushroom body. Our findings implicate cAMP signaling in mediating plasticity of behavioral patterns in aggressive behavior and in the generation of a temporally stable memory trace that manifests as a loser effect.

Mole-rats of the genus Fukomys have, however, been suggested to hear up to 18.5 kHz, unusually high for a subterranean rodent. We present audiograms of three mole-rat species, Fukomys anselli, Fukomys micklemi and the giant mole-rat Fukomys mechowii , based on evoked auditory brainstem potentials. All species showed low sensitivity and restricted hearing ranges at 60 dB SPL extending from 125 Hz to 4 kHz (5 octaves) with most sensitive hearing between 0.8 kHz and 1.4 kHz. The high frequency cut-offs are the lowest found in mammals to date. In contrast to predictions from middle ear morphology, F. mechowii did not show higher sensitivity in the low frequency range than F. anselli . These data suggest that the hearing range of Fukomys mole-rats is highly restricted to low frequencies and similar to other subterranean mammals.

The underlying cellular mechanisms influencing interspecific differences in stress tolerance are unknown, but are believed to be under regulation by sirtuins, NAD-dependent deacylases that play a critical role in the cellular stress response. A comparison of the proteomic responses of M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus to an acute heat shock in the presence and absence of the sirtuin inhibitor suramin (SIRT1, 2 and 5), showed that sirtuins affected molecular chaperones, oxidative stress proteins, metabolic enzymes, cytoskeletal and signaling proteins more in the heat-sensitive M. trossulus than in the heat-tolerant M. galloprovincialis . Interactions between sirtuin inhibition and changes in the abundance of proteins of \u03b2-oxidation and oxidative stress in M. trossulus suggest a greater role of sirtuins in shifting metabolism to reduce the production of reactive oxygen species near thermal limits. Furthermore, RNA-binding proteins initiating and inhibiting translation were affected by suramin in M. galloprovincialis and in M. trossulus , respectively. Western blot analysis showed that the levels of mitochondrial sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) were generally three times higher and increased with acute heat stress in response to sirtuin inhibition in M. trossulus but not in M. galloprovincialis , suggesting a possible feedback response in the former species and a greater reliance on SIRT5 for its stress response. Our findings suggest that SIRT5 plays an important role in setting interspecific differences in stress tolerance in Mytilus by affecting the stress proteome.

She instilled the seed of curiosity and was my first teacher. She was using methods of active learning to teach me about scientific concepts and biology, like showing me a retina from a goat to explain how eyes and vision function. Today, my mother's still asking me what my next lecture or seminar is about and wants me to explain things in a simple way. Her interest in my work keeps me on my toes with regards to my science communication skills. After your undergraduate studies you moved to the USA and returned to India to set up your lab in 2011. What influenced your decisions? I wanted to explore the best labs in the world and experience the opportunities abroad, and that's when I decided to apply for a PhD in the USA. Initially, I joined as a graduate student at the University of Arkansas for Medical Science, but then I transferred to Nebraska where I joined the lab of my PhD mentor, Steve Caplan. At the end of my training in Steve's lab, the desire to go back to India had become very strong. Then, during my postdoc, I got a first author paper rather quickly and I started interviewing for a faculty position in India early on. I may have even hurried it a bit, having been only in my third year as a postdoc, but eventually, many institutes reviewed my CV favourably and that's when I got the job offer. You mentioned your desire to return to India. What was your motivation there? Family and also research. I had always enjoyed my life in India and I feel deeply connected to the culture. As for the research, the outlook was changing around 2008. Five Indian Institutes of Science, Education and Research (IISER) had opened and these places hired the best people from around the world. Also, the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance had set up its funding with a very generous allowance. Many things were happening at the time and I felt it was the right time to return and apply for such funding opportunities to start my lab research. Nearly a decade later, how is the funding situation in India, in general, in your opinion? The funding opportunities are there, but the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance grants are very different from other grants in the country in terms of the amount of funding and also the flexibility, which is extremely important. Furthermore, with this type of international funding the exposure that one gets is great. There's also an allowance for international travel and they highly encourage having collaborations outside India. So this is great, but we also need this kind of flexibility in other funding programmes. That's more difficult in this country. A lot of investigators in India want the government to change the funding model but it hasn't happened yet. Besides the Wellcome Trust/ DBT India Alliance support, the support by IISER Mohali has also been very generous \u2013 so for me, funding has been pretty good so far. I would also like to take this opportunity to advocate for an increase in the funding of curiosity-driven, basic research, which is essential for scientific breakthroughs. What challenges did you face when starting your own lab that you didn't expect? When I returned I did not have any idea how challenging things would be as I hadn't done any real research before in India. I think that was actually good because if I had known the challenges I faced, maybe it would have taken me a little longer to decide whether I want to come back or not. IISER Mohali was also a new institute and it took time to establish the lab, to figure out how things work. The paperwork is something that's definitely a big part of our daily research life, and in general you need patience to deal with it. I think that I have also adjusted to this idea that things are going to take time, so we plan ahead a lot. Mahak with her lab members How are the challenges that you're facing now different? As the lab is completely functional now, the challenge is to seek new funding as my current grant comes to an end soon. Also, I want to develop more challenging projects to avoid being stagnant in terms of the questions or the science that I'm doing. We're learning new techniques and we're incorporating new model systems in the lab. For instance, the Allen Institute for Cell Science are in the process of developing a wonderful resource for cell biologists by creating induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells that are CRISPR-tagged at endogenous loci for different marker genes to visualize subcellular organelles and structures \u2013 I would like to incorporate this entire model of cell culture in my lab in the coming months. What questions are your lab trying to answer just now? We are studying the protein machinery that regulates cargo trafficking towards the lysosomes. Lysosomes have been on the side-line for a very long time, being called the dead-end organelle or trash can of the cell. But work in the past few years from the labs of Andrea Ballabio and David Sabatini has shown that lysosomes are the control centre of cell homeostasis, which highlights the importance of this organelle. We are trying to study how it receives cargo \u2013 this cargo could be an endosome, it could be an autophagosome, it could be a vacuole/phagosome that contains bacteria. We are studying the protein machinery that regulates the fusion of lysosome and cargo-containing compartments, such as the tethering factors and small GTPases. Furthermore, we want to know how intracellular pathogens such as Salmonella or Mycobacterium modulate or manipulate this machinery to their advantage. Recent work has also suggested that lysosome position within the cell is very important \u2013 there is a sub-class of lysosomes, peripheral lysosomes, which are very important for cell migration, bone remodelling and plasma membrane repair. We want to study how the factors that regulate lysosome positioning would contribute to these cellular processes in specialised cells. What has been the most influential publication or work in your field recently? The advances made in imaging techniques has helped the field, but I would like to specifically point to the work of a couple of people that I follow and who have inspired me: the lab of Sergio Grinstein has recently shown that there are differences between peripheral and perinuclear lysosomes with regards to protein content and pH. Equally, Paul Luzio's group put forward the notion that lysosomes could be neutral pH compartments and serve as a storage organelle for proteases. As I mentioned, the Ballabio and Sabatini labs demonstrated that lysosomes are centre stage for cell homeostasis and nutrient signalling and that has contributed substantially to my understanding and my excitement about this field. The current project that we have in the lab on manipulation of host vesicle fusion machinery by intracellular pathogens has immensely benefitted from the research done in the labs of Michael Hensel and Albert Haas, who have explained the mechanistic basis of interactions between host endosomal machinery and pathogens, as well as defined the minimum machinery required for these interactions to take place. \u201c\u2026one finds happiness in small things: a nice experiment or a new hypothesis that seems very exciting.\u201d How do you achieve a work\u2013life balance when you're trying to establish yourself as an independent investigator? In the beginning, I would stress out over small things and I've learned along the way that you just have to be patient. It was difficult to maintain a balance, even without any family responsibilities like many of my colleagues whom I commend for doing such a fantastic job. I would try to take the weekend off or I would just go for a short trip to the beautiful hills we have nearby the city, or I'd watch a movie or enjoy good theatre. It takes your mind off research and that helps to rejuvenate for the coming week. What is the best science-related advice you ever received? From my PhD, I am still very close to my mentors Steve Caplan and Naava Naslavsky. We still email a lot and they give me feedback. Advice that Steve gave me early on is that each student needs a different style of mentoring, and that I should modulate my strategy according to each student. This was very helpful. Another very important thing that he pointed out was that being a group leader can be a lonely job because you cannot necessarily share the apprehensions and disappointments along the way with your students that much \u2013 you want to keep them motivated (*laughs*). Therefore, he advised that one finds happiness in small things: a nice experiment or a new hypothesis that seems very exciting. My postdoc advisor Michael Brenner told me to un-plug myself routinely, to \u2018smell the roses along the way\u2019\u2013 all these things have definitely contributed and proven to be helpful. What is the most important advice you would give to someone about to start their own lab? I've seen many people establishing their labs and they have a plan and definitely think about each and every step, which is fantastic. So I'm not sure I can give them any advice on planning how to do things. If I had to mention one thing, I'd say don't overwhelm yourself with several big projects when you're starting your lab. It's important to keep a focus in the initial few years and to show that you're productive. For that, talk to your students regularly and orientate them early towards a publication in terms of writing a draft in their second or third year. If they get a paper early during their PhD it's very helpful for them, as well as for their CV as a young group leader. \u201cIt's important to keep a focus in the initial few years and to show that you're productive.\u201d What is your advice on establishing good collaborations? It helps if you have a specific experiment or question in mind, for example addressing something in a different model system. I think this will kick off things because your collaborator can see that there is a concrete idea and understand your vision. I wouldn't keep a collaboration too open-ended because then it generally does not take off. How do you get the most out of the meetings you attend, particularly in the early stages of your career? I do some homework to make sure that I get the most out of a meeting, especially for the big conferences like the ASCB. You have to seek out people who can give you very good feedback on the work, give advice on the project or have the special expertise that I'm looking for. For instance, I tried to learn about new techniques at the last ASCB meeting, such as BioID and super-resolution imaging. It's great if you can talk to the people who invented it or use it routinely \u2013 you can get direct information on the trouble shooting of these new challenging techniques. Could you tell us an interesting fact about yourself that people wouldn't know by looking at your CV? I really love to read poetry, specifically poetry written in Urdu. It has a really soothing and calming effect on me. I attend many recitals of Urdu poetry and I find a lot of peace in that language, in the meaning of these couplets. I sometimes recite these couplets when I have a gathering of my family members or my friends and I enjoy this beautiful language. The other thing is that I'm the movie critic of the lab and my department. My students and colleagues routinely ask me whether I've seen this new movie and so on and I like to dissect the story line and review it in length. It takes my mind off research.

Wheatcroft Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Medicine , Faculty of Medicine & Health , University of Leeds , Leeds LS2 9JT , UK PDF ABSTRACT Cell surface receptors can undergo recycling or proteolysis but the cellular decision-making events that sort between these pathways remain poorly defined. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) regulate signal transduction and angiogenesis, but how signaling and proteolysis is regulated is not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that a pathway requiring the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA1 controls basal VEGFR2 levels, hence metering plasma membrane receptor availability for the VEGF-A-regulated endothelial cell response. VEGFR2 undergoes VEGF-A-independent constitutive degradation via a UBA1-dependent ubiquitin-linked pathway. Depletion of UBA1 increased VEGFR2 recycling from endosome-to-plasma membrane and decreased proteolysis. Increased membrane receptor availability after UBA1 depletion elevated VEGF-A-stimulated activation of key signaling enzymes such as PLC\u03b31 and ERK1/2. Although UBA1 depletion caused an overall decrease in endothelial cell proliferation, surviving cells showed greater VEGF-A-stimulated responses such as cell migration and tubulogenesis. Our study now suggests that a ubiquitin-linked pathway regulates the balance between receptor recycling and degradation which in turn impacts on the intensity and duration of VEGF-A-stimulated signal transduction and the endothelial response. INTRODUCTION Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is an important regulator of animal health and disease ( Ferrara, 1999 ). VEGF-A-stimulated pathological angiogenesis is an important player in chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer and retinopathy ( Carmeliet, 2005 ; Coultas et al., 2005 ; Ferrara and Kerbel, 2005 ), whilst insufficient angiogenesis leads to damaged blood vessels, causing tissue ischaemia and heart disease ( Ungvari et al., 2010 ). VEGF binding to a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) can trigger multiple signal transduction pathways and cellular responses in vascular and non-vascular cells and tissues. In particular, VEGF-A binding to VEGFR2 on endothelial cells causes a diverse range of pro-angiogenic responses ( Olsson et al., 2006 ; Shibuya, 2010 ). Although highly studied, it is not well understood how the endothelial cell integrates multiple pathways to direct THE sprouting of new blood vessels upon encountering ligands such as VEGF-A. It is well-established that VEGF-A binding to plasma membrane VEGFR2 causes tyrosine kinase activation and post-translational modifications such as tyrosine trans-autophosphorylation and ubiquitination ( Ewan et al., 2006 ; Koch and Claesson-Welsh, 2012 ). Ligand-activated VEGFR2 can undergo ubiquitin-linked proteolysis ( Bruns et al., 2010 ; Ewan et al., 2006 ) which is regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as the proto-oncogene c-Cbl and \u03b2-transducin repeat-containing protein (\u03b2-TrCP1) ( Duval et al., 2003 ; Shaik et al., 2012 ; Singh et al., 2007 ). However, it is unclear how the endothelial cell regulates resting or basal VEGFR2 levels. One possibility is that non-modified, basal VEGFR2 located at the plasma membrane undergoes constitutive endocytosis and delivery to lysosomes for proteolysis. An alternative explanation is that a ubiquitination-dependent mechanism targets basal VEGFR2 for trafficking to degradative compartments such as late endosomes and lysosomes. A recent study has suggested that basal VEGFR2 turnover is regulated by an endosome-associated de-ubiquitinase, USP8 ( Smith et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF121 controls turnover of newly synthesized VEGFR2 in the secretory pathway ( Maghsoudlou et al., 2016 ). Hence there is an emerging body of evidence that ubiquitination of newly synthesized or basal VEGFR2 trafficking and turnover. Ubiquitination is a covalent modification involving the formation of an isopeptide bond between the amino terminus of lysine side chains with the free carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin monomers or polymers. The addition of these ubiquitin moieties to a specific protein can alter degradation, intracellular localization and modulate protein activity. Adding such a modification first requires activity of an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, followed by an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme working in concert with an E3 ubiquitin ligase ( Hershko and Ciechanover, 1992 ). Nine loci within the human genome encode E1-related enzymes which initiate activation and conjugation of a variety of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (e.g. SUMO, Nedd8) to target substrates ( Pickart, 2001 ). This study reveals the existence of a novel pathway that programs E1 ubiquitin ligase-dependent modification of basal VEGFR2 to regulate membrane trafficking and proteolysis. Such regulation is important in controlling the endothelial response to VEGF-A by integrating signal transduction, membrane trafficking and cellular responses. RESULTS UBA1 regulates basal VEGFR2 levels in endothelial cells Ligand-stimulated ubiquitination of VEGFR2 facilitates trafficking and degradation in the endosome-lysosome system ( Bruns et al., 2010 ). Previous work has shown that basal VEGFR2 also undergoes proteolysis in primary endothelial cells ( Mittar et al., 2009 ; Ulyatt et al., 2011 ) but the underlying mechanism was unknown. We hypothesized that ubiquitination of basal VEGFR2 targets this membrane receptor for trafficking and proteolysis. To identify ubiquitin-linked regulators, we evaluated the requirement for E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes in controlling VEGFR2 levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Experiments revealed that depletion of a major E1 enzyme, UBA1, caused a significant 2.8-fold ( P <0.01) increase in basal VEGFR2 levels compared to controls ( Fig. 1 A,B). There was no significant effect on basal levels of VEGFR1, another VEGFR family member ( Fig. 1 A). Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed increased staining for VEGFR2 but not VEGFR1 in UBA1-depleted cells compared to controls ( Fig. 1 C). Quantification of these staining patterns showed 2.8-fold ( P <0.05) increase in VEGFR2 levels upon UBA1 depletion ( Fig. 1 D). Treatment with different UBA1-specific siRNA duplexes consistently increased VEGFR2 levels, as observed using microscopy ( Fig. S1A ) and quantification of morphological datasets ( Fig. S1B ). All UBA1-specific siRNAs caused >80% decrease in UBA1 levels ( Fig. S1C ). Download powerpoint Fig. 1. UBA1 regulates basal VEGFR2 levels.

(F) Non-treated endothelial cell control lysates (\u2212) compared to treatment (+) with 10 \u03bcM PYR41 for 1 h immunoblotted for VEGFR2, transferrin receptor (TfR) and tubulin. (G) Quantification of VEGFR2 levels in endothelial cell control versus PYR41 treatment. In panels B, D, E and G, error bars denote mean\u00b1s.e.m. ( n \u22653), with significance denoted as *P <0.05, ** P <0.01, *** P <0.001; analysed by one-way ANOVA. In contrast, VEGFR1 levels were not affected by UBA1 depletion ( Fig. 1 E). As UBA1 and UBA6 are the only E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes that regulate ubiquitin attachment to target substrates ( Haas et al., 1982 ; Pelzer et al., 2007 ), we tested the effects of UBA6 depletion but found that this did not alter VEGFR2 or VEGFR1 levels ( Fig. 1 A-D). These data suggest that UBA1, but not UBA6, regulates basal VEGFR2 levels. The pharmacological inhibitor PYR41 irreversibly inhibits E1 enzyme activity whilst showing little or no activity against E2 or E3 enzymes ( Yang et al., 2007 ). Immunoblot analysis of PYR41-treated endothelial cells revealed an increase in basal VEGFR2 levels compared to untreated control ( Fig. 1 F). Quantification of immunoblot data revealed a \u223c30-40% increase in VEGFR2 levels upon PYR41 treatment compared to control ( Fig. 1 G). Of note, PYR41 effects on VEGFR2 levels were observed within 1\u2005h of treatment, whereas effects of RNAi-mediated depletion of UBA1 were observed 72\u2005h after treatment. Taken together, both RNAi and pharmacological studies suggest a role for UBA1 in regulating basal VEGFR2 levels. UBA1 regulates constitutive ubiquitination and degradation of VEGFR2 Blocking new protein synthesis using cycloheximide (CHX) enables the monitoring of mature VEGFR2 degradation ( Shaik et al., 2012 ). In these experiments, we combined CHX treatment and RNAi-mediated UBA1 depletion to evaluate UBA1 contribution to VEGFR2 turnover ( Fig. 2 ). Immunoblotting confirmed that basal VEGFR2 levels were elevated upon UBA1 depletion, in the absence of VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig. 2 A). In comparing VEGFR2 turnover to other membrane receptors, UBA1 depletion did not affect basal levels of other cell surface receptors such as fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) or transferrin receptor (TfR) ( Fig. 2 A). Quantification of relative protein levels upon CHX treatment revealed that \u223c60% of mature VEGFR2 underwent constitutive degradation over an 80\u2005min period ( Fig. 2 B). In contrast, UBA1-depleted endothelial cells displayed a \u223c40% increase in basal VEGFR2 levels prior to CHX addition (t=0\u2005min; Fig. 2 B). Upon subjecting UBA1-depleted cells to CHX treatment for different time periods there was a gradual decrease in VEGFR2 levels, however these VEGFR2 levels were still higher (1.6-fold) than in controls with normal UBA1 levels ( Fig. 2 B). Depletion of UBA1 thus increases steady-state levels of mature VEGFR2 but this is still subject to degradation with similar kinetics to controls ( Fig. 2 B). Download powerpoint Fig. 2.

(F) Quantification of ubiquitinated VEGFR2 (Ub-VEGFR2) levels in endothelial cells from the isolation and immunoblotting experiments shown in panel E. Relative Ub-VEGFR2 levels were normalized using total IgG and VEGFR2. IP, immunoprecipitate; WCL, whole cell lysate. In panels B, D, E and F, error bars denote mean\u00b1s.e.m. ( n \u22653), with significance denoted as *P <0.05, ** P <0.01, *** P <0.001; analysed by two-way ANOVA. To further assess UBA1 involvement in controlling basal VEGFR2 levels, we analyzed VEGFR2 distribution using immunofluorescence microscopy ( Fig. 2 C). Quantification of morphological datasets comparing control and UBA1-depleted endothelial cells showed that basal VEGFR2 levels (t=0\u2005min) were \u223c60-70% higher in UBA1-depleted cells ( Fig. 2 D). Under control conditions where new protein synthesis was blocked by CHX, cells displayed a \u223c55% decrease in overall VEGFR2 staining after 60\u2005min, compared to the 0-min time point ( Fig. 2 D). In contrast, CHX-treated and UBA1-depleted cells exhibited only a \u223c20% reduction in basal VEGFR2 levels over the same 60\u2005min period compared to the 0-min time point ( Fig. 2 D). A quantitatively similar effect of UBA1 depletion on mature VEGFR2 was also seen in a second vascular cell type, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) ( Fig. S2A ). Basal levels of mature VEGFR2 in HDMECs were elevated by \u223c20-30% after UBA1 depletion and did not decrease significantly upon CHX treatment for up to 80\u2005min in comparison to controls ( Fig. S2B ). These data show UBA1 regulates basal VEGFR2 levels in different endothelial cells derived from veins (HUVECs) and capillaries (HDMECs). One likely explanation for UBA1-mediated regulation is that basal VEGFR2 undergoes ubiquitination by a novel pathway. To test this idea, mature VEGFR2 from control or UBA1-depleted endothelial cells was immunoprecipitated and ubiquitination status evaluated over a 0-80\u2005min time course of CHX treatment ( Fig. 2 E). At the 0-min time point, relative ubiquitination compared to total VEGFR2 levels was not significantly different in UBA1-depleted cells compared to controls ( Fig. 2 F). However, during the time course of CHX treatment it was noticeable that ubiquitinated VEGFR2 levels were significantly higher in control cells than in UBA1-depleted cells ( Fig. 2 E). After 40\u2005min of CHX treatment, control cells exhibited 2.9-fold ( P <0.01) greater levels of ubiquitinated VEGFR2 compared to UBA1-depleted cells ( Fig. 2 F). Thus reduction in UBA1 levels decreased basal VEGFR2 ubiquitination. UBA1 regulates basal VEGFR2 recycling Ubiquitination at the plasma membrane frequently precedes receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) endocytosis, delivery to early endosomes and further trafficking to lysosomes for terminal degradation ( Clague and Urb\u00e9, 2001 ; Ewan et al., 2006 ; Haglund and Dikic, 2012 ). However, RTK de-ubiquitination in early or late endosomes could also enable recycling from endosome-to-plasma membrane ( Clague and Urb\u00e9, 2006 ). Such features have previously been observed in this system with VEGF-A-stimulated VEGFR2 ubiquitination promoting trafficking to late endosomes, linked to terminal degradation in lysosomes ( Bruns et al., 2010 ; Ewan et al., 2006 ). Furthermore, VEGFR2 can also undergo substantial constitutive ligand-independent recycling via endosomes ( Jopling et al., 2011 ). Another RTK such as FGFR1 undergoes similar constitutive recycling ( Hausott et al., 2012 ). One possibility is that upon UBA1 depletion, VEGFR2 undergoes decreased basal ubiquitination that in turn permits increased endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling. To test this idea, we used a VEGFR2 recycling assay ( Jopling et al., 2011 ) in which control and UBA1-depleted endothelial cells were incubated with antibodies specific for the extracellular domains of VEGFR2 or FGFR1. Constitutive RTK endocytosis and recycling was then monitored using accessibility of VEGFR2-antibody and FGFR1-antibody complexes to a pulse of labeled secondary antibody. Only VEGFR2-antibody or FGFR1-antibody complexes that underwent endocytosis followed by endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling were detected in this assay ( Fig. 3 A). Compared to control cells, UBA1-depleted endothelial cells displayed a twofold ( P <0.01) increase in endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling of non-activated VEGFR2 ( Fig. 3 B). In contrast, FGFR1 recycling was not significantly affected by UBA1 depletion ( Fig. 3 C). Download powerpoint Fig. 3. UBA1 regulates basal ubiquitination, recycling and plasma membrane levels of VEGFR2. (A) Endothelial cells transfected with non-targeting control siRNA or UBA1-specific siRNA were incubated with antibodies to the extracellular domains of VEGFR2 or FGFR1 for 30\u2005min at 37\u00b0C prior to acid-wash to strip cell surface antibodies, and incubation with fluorescent species-specific secondary antibodies for 30\u2005min at 37\u00b0C (green). Cells were fixed prior to staining with DAPI (blue). Only VEGFR2 or FGFR1 that underwent plasma membrane-to-endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling is visible. Scale bar: 200\u2005\u03bcm.

(D) Endothelial cells transfected with non-targeting control siRNA or UBA1-specific siRNA were treated with 20\u2005\u00b5g/ml CHX for 0-80\u2005min before cell surface proteins were biotinylated, isolated and immunoblotted for plasma membrane VEGFR2 (PM VEGFR2), transferrin receptor (TfR), UBA1 and tubulin. IP, immunoprecipitate; WCL, whole cell lysate. (E) Quantification of immunoblot data shown in panel D with relative values for cell surface VEGFR2 levels denoted in the histogram. In panels B and E, error bars denote mean\u00b1s.e.m. ( n \u22653), with significance denoted as *P <0.05, ** P <0.01; analysed using one-way ANOVA (panel B) and two-way ANOVA (panel E). One possibility is that increased endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling after UBA1 depletion caused an overall net increase in plasma membrane VEGFR2 levels. To test this idea, new protein synthesis was blocked with CHX and a cell surface biotinylation assay was performed to monitor the plasma membrane pool. Immunoblot analysis showed that basal VEGFR2 plasma membrane levels in UBA1-depleted cells were \u223c25% higher than in control cells (t=0 min, Fig. 3 D,E). Another cell surface receptor, transferrin receptor, was not significantly affected ( Fig. 3 D). In control cells treated with CHX, there was a \u223c55% decrease in levels of plasma membrane VEGFR2 ( Fig. 3 E). In contrast, under the same CHX treatment of UBA1-depleted cells there was a less marked (\u223c24%) decrease in plasma membrane VEGFR2 levels ( Fig. 3 E). These data suggest that loss of UBA1 causes an increase in plasma membrane VEGFR2 levels and is also consistent with increased VEGFR2 recycling from endosome-to-plasma membrane. UBA1 regulates VEGFR2 trafficking to endosomes and lysosomes VEGFR2 undergoes endocytosis, delivery to endosomes and recycling back to the plasma membrane or commitment for terminal degradation in late endosomes and lysosomes ( Ewan et al., 2006 ; Jopling et al., 2014 ). If UBA1 depletion affects VEGFR2 membrane dynamics, loss of UBA1 would be expected to alter VEGFR2 distribution within these compartments. To ascertain this, we compared VEGFR2 co-distribution with EEA1, CD63 or LAMP2 ( Fig. 4 ). UBA1-depleted endothelial cells exhibited a \u223c50% increase in VEGFR2 co-distribution with the early endosome marker EEA1 compared to controls ( Fig. 4 A,B). There was a similar increase in VEGFR2 co-distribution with the late endosome marker CD63 ( Fig. 4 B). In contrast, UBA1-depleted cells exhibited a \u223c34% decrease in VEGFR2 co-distribution with the lysosome marker LAMP2 compared to control ( Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that decreased UBA1 levels alter VEGFR2 distribution within the endosome-lysosome network. Download powerpoint Fig. 4. UBA1 depletion perturbs VEGFR2 endosome-lysosome dynamics. (A) Endothelial cells transfected with non-targeting or UBA1 siRNA were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies to VEGFR2 (green), EEA1 (red), CD63 (red) or LAMP2 (red) followed by fluorescent species-specific secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with DNA-binding dye, DAPI (blue). Scale bar: 70\u2005\u03bcm. (B) Quantification of VEGFR2 co-distribution with early endosome (EEA1), late endosome (CD63) and lysosome (LAMP2) markers in endothelial cells transfected with non-targeting control siRNA or UBA1-specific siRNA. Error bars denote mean\u00b1s.e.m. ( n \u22653), with significance denoted as *P <0.05; analysed using two-way ANOVA. UBA1 regulates VEGF-A-stimulated signal transduction VEGF-A binding to plasma membrane VEGFR2 stimulates multiple signal transduction pathways ( Koch et al., 2011 ; Zhang et al., 2008 ). Our experiments now show that UBA1 depletion leads to a net increase in plasma membrane VEGFR2; this could modulate VEGF-A-stimulated signal transduction. To test this idea, control and UBA1-depleted endothelial cells were stimulated with VEGF-A before probing downstream signaling events using quantitative immunoblotting ( Fig. 5 ). VEGFR2 activation is exemplified by phosphorylation on cytoplasmic residue Y1175 ( Koch et al., 2011 ); this was clearly evident in both control and UBA1-depleted cells ( Fig. 5 A). However, UBA1 depletion caused a significant \u223c30% increase in VEGFR2-pY1175 levels ( Fig. 5 B). Plasma membrane VEGFR2 activation is also linked to recruitment of phospholipase C\u03b31 (PLC\u03b31) followed by tyrosine phosphorylation on residue Y783 and increased phospholipase activity ( Koch et al., 2011 ). UBA1-depleted cells exhibited enhanced PLC\u03b31 phosphorylation ( Fig. 5 A) with \u223c43% increase in PLC\u03b31-pY783 levels ( Fig. 5 C). A key feature of VEGF-A-stimulated signaling is activation of the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway leading to phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase enzymes 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) ( Koch and Claesson-Welsh, 2012 ). VEGF-A stimulation caused a 3.7-fold ( P <0.05) increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in UBA1-depleted endothelial cells compared to controls ( Fig. 5 A,D). UBA1-depleted cells contained \u223c40% higher basal VEGFR2 levels. Surprisingly, the kinetics of VEGF-A-stimulated VEGFR2 degradation were not significantly affected by UBA1 depletion ( Fig. 5 A,E). Thus, UBA1 is not required for VEGF-A-stimulated VEGFR2 degradation. Download powerpoint Fig. 5. UBA1 depletion causes an increase in VEGF-A-stimulated signal transduction. (A) Endothelial cells transfected with non-targeting control siRNA or UBA1-specific siRNA were stimulated with 25\u2005ng/ml VEGF-A for specific time periods (0-60\u2005min), lysed and immunoblotted for phospho-VEGFR2 (Y1175), phospho-PLC\u03b31 (Y783), phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204), VEGFR2, ERK1/2, UBA1 and tubulin.

Relative levels for each signal were normalized against tubulin. (F) Quantification of phospho-VEGFR2 (Y1175) levels after 5\u2005min VEGF-A stimulation and normalized against total VEGFR2 levels in control or UBA1-depleted endothelial cells. (G) Endothelial cells transfected with non-targeting control siRNA or UBA1-specific siRNA were treated with 25\u2005ng/ml basic FGF (bFGF), lysed and immunoblotted for phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204), VEGFR2, FGFR1, UBA1 and tubulin. In panels B-F, error bars denote mean\u00b1s.e.m. ( n \u22653), with significance denoted as *P <0.05, *** P <0.001; analysed using two-way ANOVA. These data suggest that increased VEGFR2 phosphorylation in UBA1-depleted cells ( Fig. 5 B) was due to an overall net increase in plasma membrane VEGFR2 levels rather than effects on VEGFR2 activation at the individual receptor level ( Fig. 5 F). To test whether UBA1 depletion affects other RTK signal transduction events, UBA1-depleted endothelial cells were subjected to a time-course of bFGF which is known to activate FGFR1-regulated MAPK signal transduction in endothelial cells. Both control and UBA1-depleted cells exhibited similar responses to bFGF stimulation such as ERK1/2 activation ( Fig. 5 G). Thus UBA1 regulates signal transduction by VEGFR2 but not FGFR1. Basal VEGFR2 turnover regulates VEGF-A-dependent endothelial cell tubulogenesis UBA1 is the principal E1 enzyme in human cells and is likely to be involved in many cellular processes ( Groen and Gillingwater, 2015 ). Depletion of UBA1 caused 2.4-fold ( P <0.001) decrease in endothelial cell proliferation in the absence of VEGF-A ( Fig. 6 A). However, remaining viable endothelial cells showed a 2.3-fold increase in VEGF-A-stimulated proliferation compared to a 1.7-fold increase in control cells ( P <0.01) ( Fig. 6 B). Signal transduction by VEGF-A-activated VEGFR2 promotes new vascular tube formation by endothelial cells, an essential feature in angiogenesis ( Ferrara, 1999 ). Immunoblotting confirmed that UBA1-specific siRNA transfection was effective at depleting endothelial UBA1 levels for extended periods ( Fig. 6 C), corresponding to the 7-day duration of the tubulogenesis assay. UBA1-depleted cells exhibited lower tubule length ( Fig. 6 D) and number of tubule branch points ( Fig. 6 E) in absolute numbers compared to non-transfected or control siRNA-transfected controls. However, VEGF-A stimulation of UBA1-depleted cells increased tubule length 4.4-fold ( Fig. 6 F) and branch point number 22.3-fold when compared to UBA1-depleted cells in the absence of VEGF-A ( Fig. 6 F). These effects were substantially higher than the VEGF-A-stimulated 2.6-fold ( P <0.01) increase in tubule length ( Fig. 6 F) and 4.6-fold ( P <0.001) increase in branch point number ( Fig. 6 G) for control siRNA-transfected controls. These findings show that UBA1 has functional impact on VEGF-A-stimulated endothelial tubulogenesis. Download powerpoint Fig. 6.

VEGF-A-stimulated endothelial cell migration is elevated by decreased UBA1 levels VEGF-A-dependent signaling also stimulates endothelial cell migration ( Fearnley et al., 2014 ; Smith et al., 2015a , b ). To test the role of UBA1, we analyzed control and UBA1-depleted endothelial cells for migration towards VEGF-A ( Fig. 7 A). Quantification of these images showed that UBA1 depletion caused an overall decrease in non-stimulated and VEGF-A-stimulated endothelial cell migration compared to non-transfected or control siRNA-transfected cells ( Fig. 7 B). However, comparison of non-stimulated versus VEGF-A-stimulated migration of UBA1-depleted cells showed 14.6-fold increase in VEGF-A-stimulated endothelial cell migration ( Fig. 7 C). This effect was 3.7-fold ( P <0.001) higher than the VEGF-A-stimulated migration exhibited by control siRNA-transfected cells ( Fig. 7 C). We also tested the VEGF-A-stimulated closure of a wounded endothelial cell monolayer which represents both cell proliferation and migration. There was a significant VEGF-A-stimulated re-occupation of the wounded area by UBA1-depleted cells in comparison to non-transfected and control siRNA-treated cells ( Fig. 7 D). This experiment showed a \u223c31% increase in VEGF-A-stimulated wound closure in UBA1-depleted cells compared to control siRNA-treated cells ( Fig. 7 E). These data show that loss of UBA1 elevates the endothelial cell response to VEGF-A which is reflected reflected by endothelial endothelial cell migration and monolayer wound closure.

DISCUSSION Our study now provides compelling evidence for a ubiquitin-linked pathway which regulates basal VEGFR2 levels and impacts on VEGF-A-stimulated signal transduction and multiple cellular responses. Our findings support the existence of a mechanism whereby cells adjust the net pool of plasma membrane VEGFR2, thus controlling RTK-mediated signal transduction and the cellular response to extracellular ligands such as VEGF-A. This ligand-independent regulatory pathway mediates VEGFR2 availability at the plasma membrane for VEGF-A-stimulated signal transduction. The E1 enzyme, UBA1, regulates basal plasma membrane VEGFR2 levels which influence VEGF-A-stimulated activation of PLC\u03b31 and ERK1/2 signal transduction pathways. A key point is that UBA1 influences the pool of plasma membrane VEGFR2 which in turn dictates net VEGFR2 activation. VEGFR2 ubiquitination plays key roles in membrane trafficking and degradation but previous work has focused on VEGF-stimulated responses ( Bruns et al., 2010 ; Ewan et al., 2006 ; Smith et al., 2015a , b ). Our study now highlights a mechanism involving UBA1 which controls basal VEGFR2 levels and VEGF-A-stimulated cellular responses. This type of RTK ubiquitination is closely linked to trafficking as highlighted by perturbation of VEGFR2 endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling when UBA1 levels are depleted. Under these conditions, VEGFR2 showed increased co-distribution with endosomes but reduced co-distribution with lysosomes. Trafficking of other plasma membrane receptors such as transferrin receptor and another RTK (FGFR1) did not show UBA1-dependence, suggesting this UBA1-regulated pathway has specificity for a subset of proteins which includes VEGFR2. Nonetheless, such ubiquitin-linked regulation of basal VEGFR2 has important consequences for VEGF-A-stimulated cellular responses such as endothelial tubulogenesis, migration and proliferation: there is clear elevation in VEGF-A-stimulated pro-angiogenic responses upon UBA1 depletion. Ligand-stimulated ubiquitination of VEGFR2 programs terminal degradation in lysosomes ( Ewan et al., 2006 ). Conflicting studies implicate E3 ligases Cbl proto-oncogene E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (c-Cbl) and \u03b2-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (\u03b2-TrCP1) in VEGF-A-stimulated proteolysis of VEGFR2 ( Bruns et al., 2010 ; Duval et al., 2003 ; Murdaca et al., 2004 ; Shaik et al., 2012 ; Singh et al., 2007 ). Furthermore, differences in VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 proteolysis under either resting ( Mittar et al., 2009 ) or hypoxic ( Ulyatt et al., 2011 ) conditions suggest that endothelial cells exploit VEGFR availability to fine-tune the cellular response to VEGF-A. Recent studies have also highlighted ligand-independent VEGFR2 de-ubiquitination linked to the de-ubiquitinase USP8 that controls membrane trafficking, recycling and proteolysis ( Smith et al., 2015a , b ). Interestingly, kinase-independent regulation of RTK function is highlighted by the discovery that constitutive binding of cytosolic adaptors such as growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2) to basal FGFR2 regulates ligand-independent activation of downstream signaling pathways ( Lin et al., 2012 ). In addition, ligand-independent ubiquitination and endocytosis of EGFR involves the Hrs endocytic adaptor protein ( Katz et al., 2002 ) that is found on a subset of early endosomes. There is also a new kinase-independent autophagic role for EGFR ( Tan et al., 2015 ). These diverse studies emphasize how ligand-independent control of RTK turnover and function can impact on ligand-stimulated cellular responses. UBA1 is an essential cellular enzyme expressed by many cells and tissues and is functionally implicated in multiple pathways including DNA replication. Notably, suppression of UBA1 activity in Schwann cells is linked to spinal muscular atrophy ( Aghamaleky Sarvestany et al., 2014 ; Sugaya et al., 2015 ). Other studies have identified UBA1 as a novel target for the treatment of hematological malignancies ( Xu et al., 2010 ; Yang et al., 2007 ). UBA1-mediated surveillance of disease-linked responses could thus be utilized for controlling RTK levels and cellular responses in different tissues. The potential for UBA1 in cell proliferation and disease is highlighted in the profiling of certain cancers (e.g. prostate cancer) which show reduced UBA1 expression ( www.proteinatlas.org ). One mechanism employed by cancerous cells could be down-regulation of UBA1 expression to stimulate tumor angiogenesis. By providing a UBA1-regulated mechanism to control basal VEGFR2 availability which impacts on signal transduction and cellular responses, our study provides a non-canonical pathway that is unique to the established model for ligand-stimulated RTK ubiquitination, trafficking and proteolysis. Our findings provide a new understanding of ubiquitin-linked regulation of VEGF-regulated outcomes and could be of use to new strategies that target angiogenesis in diverse disease states. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and materials Primary HUVECs were cultured as previously described ( Fearnley et al., 2014 ; Howell et al., 2004 ), HDMECs and appropriate growth media were from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany). Purified primary and secondary antibodies were typically used at 1\u2005\u00b5g/ml for microscopy and at 0.1\u2005\u00b5g/ml for immunoblotting. These antibodies were goat anti-VEGFR2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA), rabbit anti-phospho-VEGFR2 (Y1175), rabbit anti-UBA1 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, USA), rabbit antibodies to native and phosphorylated PLC\u03b31 (Y783), rabbit anti-ERK1/2, mouse anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (T202, Y204), mouse anti-\u03b1-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA), mouse anti-transferrin receptor (TfR), mouse FK2 anti-ubiquitin (Affiniti Research Products, Exeter, UK), mouse anti-EEA1 (BD Biosciences, California, USA), mouse anti-CD63 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-LAMP2 (Santa Cruz, USA), HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher, Loughborough, UK) and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (ThermoFisher). Endothelial cell growth medium (PromoCell), non-targeting and UBA1 siRNA duplexes (GE Dharmacon, UK) and recombinant human VEGF-A 165 (Genentech Inc., San Francisco, USA) were obtained as stated. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK) or Thermo Fisher (Loughborough, UK). Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy Endothelial cells were serum starved in MCDB131 (Thermo Fisher) for 2\u2005h prior to treatment with 25\u2005ng/ml VEGF-A 165 (0-60\u2005min), 20\u2005\u03bcg/ml CHX (0-80\u2005min) or 10\u2005\u03bcM PYR41 (1\u2005h) and lysed for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation studies. Cells were lysed in 2% (w/v) SDS and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel at 120\u2005V for 90\u2005min. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane at 300\u2005mA for 3\u2005h and incubated in primary antibodies overnight prior to incubation in HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1\u2005h and detection using enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoblots were quantified, normalized against tubulin and made relative to the control (i.e. the control siRNA 0 min condition) for representation on graphs. For immunofluorescence analysis, HUVECs were seeded in 96-well plates or on cover-slips before fixation, permeabilization in 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, incubation with primary antibodies and visualization by incubation in Alexa Fluor488- or 594-conjugated secondary antibodies and DAPI. Images were acquired using an EVOS-fl inverted digital microscope (Thermo Fisher) at 20\u00d7 magnification or a wide-field deconvolution microscope DeltaVision (Applied Precision Inc., Issaquah, USA) at 60\u00d7 magnification at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity (integrated density) and co-localization (co-localization threshold plugin) were quantified using NIH ImageJ ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html ). Immunoprecipitation analysis HUVECs were serum starved for 2\u2005h prior to CHX treatment or VEGF-A stimulation, lysed in buffer [150\u2005mM NaCl, 50\u2005mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 2\u2005mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 50\u2005mM NaF, 1\u2005mM PMSF, 10\u2005mM iodoacetamide], incubated with 1\u2005\u03bcg/ml goat anti-VEGFR2 for 2\u2005h and immuno-isolated with protein G-agarose beads before SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Plasma membrane protein recycling assay HUVECs were incubated in primary antibody to VEGFR2 or FGFR1 for 30\u2005min at 37\u00b0C. Cell surface-bound primary antibody was stripped by washing in acidic MCDB131 medium (pH 2.0) at 4\u00b0C. Cells were incubated in secondary antibody (anti-sheep Alexa Fluor488) for 30\u2005min at 37\u00b0C and fixed for 5\u2005min at 37\u00b0C before incubation with 1\u2005\u03bcg/ml DAPI to visualize nuclear DNA. Only cell surface VEGFR2 that had bound primary antibody and undergone internalization and subsequent recycling would be available to bind secondary antibody after acid-washing. Thus, only VEGFR2 that recycled one or more times was visualized. Images were acquired using an EVOS-fl inverted digital microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using NIH ImageJ ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html ). Cell surface biotinylation HUVECs were serum starved for 2\u2005h prior to CHX treatment, washed in ice-cold PBS, cell surface biotinylated by incubation with 0.25\u2005mg/ml biotin in buffer (2\u2005mM CaCl 2 , 2\u2005mM MgCl 2 , PBS) for 45\u2005min, washed in TBS to quench biotinylation and lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer [1% (v/v) NP-40, 50\u2005mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150\u2005mM NaCl, 1\u2005mM PMSF]. Cell surface proteins were isolated using NeutraAvidin agarose beads before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Protein depletion using RNAi Endothelial cells were reverse transfected in 6- or 96-well plates with 4 pooled siRNA duplexes (SMARTpool siRNA, GE Dharmacon) as follows. 20\u2005nM non-targeting control siRNA: 5\u2032-UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-UGGUUUACAUGUUGUGUGA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-UGGUUUACAUGUUUUCUGA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-UGGUUUACAUGUUUUCCUA-3\u2032. 20\u2005nM UBA1 siRNA: 5\u2032-GCGUGGAGAUCGCUAAGAA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CCUUAUACCUUUAGCAUCU-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CCACAUAUCCGGGUGACAA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GAAGUCAAAUCUGAAUCGA-3\u2032. All siRNA duplexes were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Dharmacon). Endothelial cells were incubated for 6\u2005h with siRNA duplexes using a previously described lipid-based transfection protocol ( Fearnley et al., 2014 ). After 72\u2005h, cells were processed for lysis and immunoblotting as previously described. Cell migration and proliferation assays For the cell migration assay, 48\u2005h after transfection with control or UBA1 siRNA, HUVECs were seeded in starvation media (MCDB131) at 3\u00d710 4 cells per well in an 8\u2005\u03bcm pore size Transwell filter inserted into a 24-well companion plate (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). MCDB131 containing 25\u2005ng/ml VEGF-A was added to the lower chambers to set up a chemotactic gradient for cells to migrate towards. Cells were incubated for 24\u2005h before being fixed and stained with 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet in 20% (v/v) methanol. Non-migrated cells were removed from the upper chamber. 3-5 random fields were imaged per Transwell filter. For the cell proliferation assay, 48\u2005h after transfection with control or UBA1 siRNA, HUVECs were seeded at 2\u00d710 3 cells per well in 96-well plates in complete growth media. After 24\u2005h cells were serum starved in MCDB131 for 2\u2005h prior to stimulation with 25\u2005ng/ml VEGF-A for 24\u2005h. At the 20\u2005h time point, 10\u2005\u03bcM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was added and a cell proliferation ELISA performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK). Color change was developed using 3,3\u20325,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine solution and the reaction quenched with 1\u2005M H 2 SO 4 . Absorbance was measured at 450\u2005nm using a variable wavelength 96-well Tecan Sunrise plate reader (Mannedorf, Switzerland). Endothelial tubulogenesis and monolayer wound assays For the tubulogenesis assay, HUVECs transfected with siRNA were seeded onto a bed of confluent primary human fibroblasts and stimulated with 25\u2005ng/ml VEGF-A every 48\u2005h for 7\u2005days. Co-cultures were grown in 50:50 ECGM and DMEM [with 10% (v/v) FCS, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids]. Tubules were stained with endothelial-specific marker, PECAM-1, overnight and incubated in anti-mouse secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 594) and DNA-binding dye, DAPI, for 2\u2005h at room temperature. Images were acquired using an Evos-fI inverted digital microscope. Five random fields were imaged per well at 10\u00d7 magnification at room temperature. Both total tubule length and the number of branch points were quantified from each photographic field using the open source software AngioQuant ( www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/csb/angioquant ) and values averaged. For the monolayer wound assay, endothelial cells were transfected with control or UBA1 siRNA and grown to a confluent monolayer in ECGM for 48\u2005h. The cell monolayer was scratched using a 1\u2005ml blue plastic pipette tip at the 0\u2005h time point and stimulated with 25\u2005ng/ml VEGF-A. After 24\u2005h, wound closure was captured using an Evos-fI inverted digital microscope and scratch width quantified using ImageJ. Statistical analysis This was performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post-test analysis for multiple comparisons or two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, USA). Significant differences between control and test groups were evaluated with * P <0.05, ** P <0.01, *** P <0.001 and **** P <0.0001 indicated on the graphs.

However, the molecular mechanisms for its anti-tumor function are not fully understood. This work aimed to investigate the effect of bufalin on the proliferation and apoptosis of human gastric cancer (HGC) cells and the roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy in bufalin-induced apoptosis. HGC cell lines, SGC7901 and BGC823, were treated with different concentrations of bufalin or 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin for 1, 2, 3 and 4\u2005days. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and direct cell counting method were used to detect proliferation. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry. Protein levels of caspase-3, -8, Bax/Bcl-2, Beclin-1, LC3, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were determined using western blotting. Autophagy was blocked using 3-methyladenine (3MA) or Atg5 siRNA to evaluate the effect of autophagy on bufalin-induced apoptosis. The IRE1 and CHOP were knocked down using specific siRNA to determine the pathway involved in bufalin-induced autophagy. It was found that bufalin significantly suppressed proliferation of SGC7901 and BGC823 cells and induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The mechanism responsible for bufalin-induced apoptosis was the formation of ER stress via the IRE1-JNK pathway. Moreover, autophagy was activated during ER stress, and blocking autophagy significantly exacerbated bufalin-induced apoptosis. INTRODUCTION Gastric cancer is one of the most common digestive malignant tumors in the world. China, Japan, and South Korea, as well as some western countries, are the high-incidence areas of gastric cancer. According to statistics, in China there are 400,000 new cases of gastric cancer every year accounting for 42% of the world's total number of cases ( Yang, 2006 ). Although the five-year survival rate of patients with early gastric cancer is greater than 90% after surgery, the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer is poor, and the five-year survival rate is around 5-20% ( Bang et al., 2010 ). However, due to lack of specific performance, the early gastric cancer is difficult to detect. Approximately two-thirds of patients are found to have advanced gastric cancer, and can only be treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy ( Pozzo and Barone, 2008 ). Although numerous chemotherapeutic agents, such as epirubicin, fluorouracil, docetaxel and cisplatin have been used in clinical practice and made some progress in the improvement of survival rates of patients with advanced gastric cancer, drug resistance is still a common phenomenon, and it remains a great challenge to explore more efficacious drugs and therapies ( Jemal et al., 2015 ; Martel et al., 2013 ). Bufalin is a major medicinal ingredient extracted from the Chinese traditional medicine Chan Su. Accumulating studies have demonstrated that bufalin could inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of various tumor cell lines, including bladder cancer cells, uterine choriocarcinoma cells, breast cancer cells and liver cancer cells, and no obvious side effects have been observed ( Takai et al., 2012 ; Li et al., 2009 ; Jiang et al., 2010 ). However, the mechanisms responsible for its anti-tumor efficacy are probably multifactorial and not fully understood. Dan Li et al. demonstrated bufalin at a high concentration (80\u2005nmol/l) could induce human gastric cancer cell line (MGC803) apoptosis through increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, activating caspase-3 and inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway ( Li et al., 2009 ). Bufalin has also been found to cause apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via a sequence of apoptotic modulators, including Bax, cytochrome c, and caspases, and the upstream mediators might be p53 and Fas ( Yu et al., 2008 ). Chuan-Ming Xie et al. found bufalin induced human colon cancer cells (SW620) apoptosis by activation of autophagy through reactive oxygen species generation and JNK activation, which was evidenced by the accumulation of LC3-II, and increased levels of ATG5 and Beclin-1 ( Xie et al., 2011 ). At this time, there are very few data concerning the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy in the progression of bufalin-induced apoptosis in human gastric cancer (HGC) lines. In this work, the effect of bufalin on the proliferation, apoptosis, and activation of ER stress and autophagy of two HGC lines, BGC823 and SGC7901, were determined. In addition, the interaction between ER stress and autophagy, and the influence of autophagy on bufalin-induced apoptosis were also investigated. RESULTS Bufalin suppressed proliferation of HGC cells and induced their cell cycle arrest SGC7901 and BGC823 cells were treated with a series of different concentrations of bufalin (0, 20, 50, 80, 100, 150 and 200\u2005nmol/l) for 48\u2005h or 80\u2005nmol/l of bufalin for the indicated durations (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4\u2005days), and the cell viability was measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Bufalin elicited a decrease in cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HGC cells ( Fig. 1 A), whereas showed little influence on normal gastric mucous epithelium cell line, GES-1, until 200\u2005nmol/l ( Fig. 1 A). Trypan Blue assay showed that bufalin significantly inhibited cell proliferation both in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 cell lines compared with vehicle ( Fig. 1 B). Flow cytometric analysis was performed to examine the effect of bufalin on proliferation of HGC cells by altering cell-cycle progression. The results demonstrated that bufalin exposure (50 or 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin for 48\u2005h) remarkably induced the increase of the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase in both SGC7901 and BGC823 cells ( Fig. 1 C). Download powerpoint Fig. 1. Bufalin suppressed proliferation of HGC cells and induced their cell cycle arrest. (A) HGC cells and a normal gastric mucous epithelium cell, GES-1, were treated with 20, 50, 80, 100, 150 and 200\u2005nmol/l of bufalin or vehicle as control for 48\u2005h, or 80\u2005nmol/l of bufalin for 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4\u2005days. Cell viability was determined using a CCK-8 assay. (B) Trypan Blue assays were performed to determine the anti-proliferative effect of bufalin on SGC7901 and BGC823 cells. (C) HGC cells were treated with 50 and 80\u2005nmol/l of bufalin or vehicle as control for 48\u2005h. The cell cycle distribution was determined using flow cytometric analysis and cell cycle distribution was quantified. * P <0.05 versus control treatment, ** P <0.01 versus control treatment, Student's t -test. Data are presented as mean\u00b1s.e. Bufalin induced ER stress-mediated apoptosis in HGC cells via the IRE1-JNK pathway To investigate the effect of bufalin on apoptosis, the apoptotic rate of SGC7901 and BGC823 cells exposed to bufalin was examined using flow cytometry. Compared with vehicle, 50 or 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin markedly promoted apoptosis of cancer cells ( Fig. 2 A). To elucidate the mechanism by which bufalin induced apoptosis in HGC cells, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins was determined using western blotting assay. Our data suggested that the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, were significantly increased after bufalin treatment ( Fig. 2 B,C), indicating that caspase and mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway were involved in bufalin-induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. Moreover, the expression of target genes of the ER stress pathway, including inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and phospho-eIF2a, was significantly increased after 48\u2005h of exposure to 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin ( Fig. 2 B,C), indicating that bufalin induced ER stress in gastric cancer cells. Download powerpoint Fig. 2. Bufalin induced ER stress-mediated apoptosis in HGC cells via the IRE1-JNK pathway. (A) HGC cells were treated with 50 and 80\u2005nmol/l of bufalin or vehicle as control for 48\u2005h and apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. (B) HGC cells were incubated with 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin for 48\u2005h. The expression of ER stress and apoptosis-related proteins were detected by western blot analysis. (C) The density of each protein band was measured and normalized to that of \u03b2-actin. (D) HGC cells were transfected negative siRNA and specific siRNAs against IRE1 and CHOP and exposed to 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin. Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis after 48\u2005h. (E,F) Specific siRNA was used to knock down the expression of IRE1 with negative siRNA as control and SP600125 (10\u2005\u03bcmol/l) was used to block the JNK pathway with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) as control in HGC cells. Cells were exposed to 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin for 48\u2005h, and phosphorylation of JNK and IRE1 expression were determined by western blot analysis. (G) Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. * P <0.05 versus control treatment, ** P <0.01 versus control treatment, # P <0.05 versus bufalin treatment, ## P <0.01 versus bufalin treatment, ANOVA post hoc test. Data are presented as mean\u00b1s.e. To determine the role of ER stress in bufalin-induced apoptosis, and which pathway was involved in the pro-apoptotic effect, CHOP or IRE1 expression in SGC7901 and BGC823 cells was reduced using siRNAs targeting CHOP or IRE1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 D, IRE1 knockdown greatly abolished the apoptosis-inducing effect of bufalin in HGC cells, however CHOP knockdown did not. The results suggested IRE1 pathway was involved in bufalin-induced apoptosis in HGC cells. It has been demonstrated that JNK activation by the kinase domain of IRE1 contributed to the ER stress-induced apoptosis in tubular epithelial cells ( Kato et al., 2012 ). In parallel to the marked increase of IRE1 expression in response to bufalin, immunoblotting demonstrated that the expression of phosphorylated JNK protein also increased after bufalin treatment ( Fig. 2 B,C). To address whether JNK was activated by IRE1 and subsequently led to HGC cell apoptosis in response to bufalin, the cells transfected with IRE1-siRNA or negative siRNA were pretreated with the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 (S5567, Sigma), and apoptosis was determined after bufalin exposure. As expected, SP600125 significantly attenuated bufalin-induced JNK activation in cells transfected with negative control siRNA, whereas it showed little influence on increased IRE1 expression ( Fig. 2 E,F). In cells transfected with IRE1-siRNA, exposed bufalin did not induce JNK activation ( Fig. 2 E,F). The results of apoptosis determination showed JNK inhibition using SP600125 significantly reduced bufalin-induced apoptosis in normal control HGC cells, however could not decrease the proportion of apoptotic cells when IRE1 was knocked down ( Fig. 2 G). In conclusion, IRE1 upregulation induced JNK activation and played a vital role in bufalin-induced HGC cell apoptosis. Bufalin activated protective autophagy in HGC cells Accumulating studies have demonstrated that protective autophagy can be activated by ER stress, which may contribute to chemotherapy resistance of lung epithelial cells, cervical cancer cells and digestive tract malignancies ( Oh and Lim, 2009 ; Xu et al., 2012 ; Sui et al., 2013 ; Verfaillie et al., 2010 ). Since bufalin was found to induce ER stress in SGC7901 and BGC823 cells, the effects of bufalin on the autophagy progression in these cell lines were assessed through determination of the protein expression of LC3-I and p62. Compared to cells treated with vehicle, the levels of LC3-I and p62 significantly decreased in HGC cells treated with bufalin, whereas LC3-II increased ( Fig. 3 A), indicating bufalin treatment induced LC3 conversion and p62 degradation in HGC cells. Inhibition of lysosomal degradation in HGC cells exposed to bufalin using bafilomycin A1 further increased LC3-II level, and restored p62 amount to almost normal level ( Fig. 3 A). Taken together, bufalin induced autophagic flux increase in HGC cells. Download powerpoint Fig. 3. Bufalin activated protective autophagy in HGC cells. (A) HGC cells were treated with 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin and/or 100\u2005nmol/l bafilomycin A1 for 48\u2005h, the expression of LC3-II and p62 was determined. (B) HGC cells were pretreated with 10\u2005mM 3MA for 6\u2005h, and then exposed to 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin or vehicle for 48\u2005h. The expression of LC3-I, LC3-II, Beclin-1, caspase-3, -8 and Atg5 were detected by western blot analysis. (C) The density of each protein band was measured and normalized to that of \u03b2-actin. (D) The cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric and the percentage of annexin V-positive cells was quantified. (E,F) Specific siRNAs against Atg5 was transfected in HGC cells. After exposed to 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin for 48\u2005h, the protein levels of Atg5, Beclin-1, LC3-II, cleaved caspase-3, -8 and apoptosis were determined. * P <0.05 versus vehicle, ** P <0.01 versus vehicle, # P <0.05 versus bufalin, ## P <0.01 versus bufalin, ANOVA post hoc test.

To investigate the effect of bufalin-induced autophagy on the survival of SGC7901 and BGC823 cells, the cells were pretreated with 10\u2005mM 3-methyladenine (3MA; M9281, Sigma) for 6\u2005h or transfected with Atg5 siRNA to block autophagy. Inactivation of autophagy significantly exacerbated bufalin-induced apoptosis, evidenced by the increased proportion of apoptotic cells and cleaved caspase-3, and -8 ( Fig. 3 B-F). These data indicated that bufalin-induced autophagy is conducive to the survival of gastric cancer cells. The IRE1 signaling pathway is required for the activation of autophagy induced by ER stress Recently, there is evidence that when the ER stress exceeds to a certain extent, the activated unfolded protein response (UPR) triggers autophagy ( H\u00f8yer-Hansen and J\u00e4\u00e4ttel\u00e4, 2007 ). At present, the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) and IRE1 signal transduction pathway of UPR are implicated in the activation of autophagy. As mentioned above, the PERK and IRE1 are activated in SGC7901 and BGC823 cells in response to ER stress after treatment with bufalin. To determine the exact pathway involved in autophagy activation, the CHOP and IRE1 were knocked-down using siRNA, and autophagy activation was determined. CHOP and IRE1 expression were significantly decreased by CHOP siRNA and IRE1 siRNA, respectively, whether bafilomycin A1 existed or not ( Fig. 4 A,B). IRE1 knockdown suppressed bufalin-induced LC3 conversion and LC3-II further accumulation when autophagy was inhibited by bafilomycin A1, whereas CHOP knockdown showed little influence on the autophagy progress ( Fig. 4 A,C). In line with this, IRE1 knockdown also suppressed p62 degradation induced by bufalin ( Fig. 4 A,C). However, no significant difference was observed between CHOP knockdown cells and control cells in p62 protein levels ( Fig. 4 ). Our data suggest that IRE1 plays a vital role in ER stress-induced autophagy following bufalin treatment. Download powerpoint Fig. 4. IRE1 signaling pathway is required for the activation of autophagy induced by ER stress.

(B,C) The band density in A was measured and compared to that of \u03b2-actin to calculate relative band density. * P <0.05 versus negative siRNA, ** P <0.01 versus negative siRNA, ANOVA post hoc test. Data are presented as mean\u00b1s.e. DISCUSSION Bufalin is a kind of water-soluble preparation produced by the skin and parotid venom glands of the B ufo gargarizans Cantor, and is widely used in China to treat various cancers. Accumulating clinical and experimental research has confirmed bufalin can inhibit various human tumor cell proliferation, induce differentiation, promote apoptosis and suppress angiogenesis ( Yin et al., 2012 ; Takai et al., 2012 ). However, the mechanisms responsible are poorly understood. Therefore, the elucidation of its mechanism of anti-tumor activity has great significance not only for the improvement of the accuracy of clinical medication of bufalin but also in the development of new anti-tumor drugs. Accumulating evidence suggests bufalin could inhibit the proliferation of multiple tumor cell types, including human colon cancer cells (colon, 26-L5), leukemia cells (K562, U937, ML1 and HL-60), hepatocellular carcinoma cells (SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402), prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, DU 145 and PC3), endometrial carcinoma cells (HHUA and HEC-1), and ovarian cancer cells (SK-OV3 and omc-3) ( Xian et al., 2007 ; Debatin and Krammer, 2004 ; Caldwell and Park, 2009 ). In this work, the proliferation of SGC7901 and BGC823 was remarkably restrained by bufalin treatment in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometry showed that bufalin induced HGC cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. In accordance with our results, N. Takai et al. also documented that endometrial and ovarian cancer cell lines (Ishikawa, HHUA, HEC-1B, SK-OV-3 and OMC-3) were sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effect of bufalin and their exposure to bufalin increased the proportion in the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle, which might be related to the up-regulation of p21 WAF1 and decreased expression of cyclin A and cyclin D3 ( Takai et al., 2008 ). In addition to inducing proliferation inhibition, our data showed bufalin treatment also promoted HGC cell apoptosis. The apoptosis-induced effects of bufalin have been well documented in a wide spectrum of cancer cells, including lung cancer cells (A549) ( Zhitu and Hongzhi, 2012 ), breast cancer cells ( Dong et al., 2011 ), prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and leukemia ( Yu et al., 2008 ; Qi et al., 2011 ; Yin et al., 2011 ; Hashimoto et al., 1997 ). It is also well documented that bufalin could induce apoptosis in gastric cancer. Anticancer drugs induce tumor cell apoptosis through different apoptotic pathways, such as mitochondrial pathway, death receptor-mediated signaling pathway, and ER stress-mediated pathway ( Von and Vollmar, 2010 ). Bufalin at concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1\u2005\u03bcmol/l could induce gastric cancer cell (MGC803) death characterized by DNA content changes to apoptotic phenotypes and chromosome DNA fragmentation ( Chen, 2000 ). Dan Li et al. demonstrated that bufalin induced MGC803 cell apoptosis through increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, activation of caspase-3 and inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway; and a combination of bufalin and LY294002, a PI3K-specific inhibitor, enhanced apoptosis ( Li et al., 2009 ). Here, we found bufalin induced HGC cells apoptosis through ER stress mediated activation of the IRE1-JNK pathway. ER dysfunction leads to the unfolded protein response, which can eventually trigger cell death if the dysfunction is extensive or prolonged ( Xu et al., 2005 ). Existing evidence has indicated bufalin could induce ER stress in a variety of tumor cells, including glioma cells ( Shen et al., 2014 ), hepatocellular carcinoma cells ( Hu et al., 2014 ) and osteoblastoma cells ( Zhu et al., 2014 ). Three molecular sensors are associated with UPR pathway, IRE1, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PERK. Activated PERK could result in CHOP activation through eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). In this work, IRE1, p-eIF2\u03b1 and CHOP were all significantly increased in HGC cells after exposure to bufalin, indicating both IRE1 and PERK were involved in bufalin-induced HGC cells apoptosis. However, only IRE1 silence reduced bufalin-induced apoptosis, suggesting IRE1 pathway plays a vital role in the induction of apoptosis under conditions of ER stress. Similar to our study, Fengli Hu et al. also found hepatocellular carcinoma cells with silenced IRE1 expression had a higher viability after treatment with bufalin, whereas cells with silenced CHOP expression did not ( Hu et al., 2014 ). The unexpected results may be due to the different functions of the three pathways in ER stress. Numerous studies have identified that the decision between pro-survival and pro-death outcomes in the ER stress pathway is determined by the activity of IRE1 ( Chen and Brandizzi, 2013 ). Bufalin-induced increase in JNK phosphorylation could be reversed by siRNA targeting IRE1, which suggested JNK was downstream of IRE1. In addition, JNK inhibition using SP600125 or siRNA targeting IRE1 partly abolished bufalin-induced HGC cell apoptosis. In conclusion, the results indicated that IRE1 upregulation-induced JNK activation plays a vital role in bufalin-induced HGC cell apoptosis. Autophagy is an important metabolic process that allows degradation and reuse of intracellular biological macromolecules and damaged organelles under certain stress conditions ( Mizushima, 2007 ). Autophagy has a dual nature in the regulation of cell death: mild autophagy protects cells against harmful conditions and promotes cell survival; serious or quick autophagy induces programmed cell death, known as autophagic cell death ( Codogno, 2005 ). Various cellular stresses such as ROS production, hypoxia, misfolded protein accumulation, irradiation and ER stress stimulation can induce autophagy. Moreover, autophagy can also be induced by multiple cytotoxic chemotherapeutic reagents ( Tsai et al., 2012 ). Recent studies suggest that when the ER stress exceeded to a certain extent, the activated UPR induces autophagy. It has been discovered that PERK and IRE1 pathways are involved in the activation of autophagy. Kouroku et al. found that abnormal expression and accumulation of polyglutamine Q72 in mouse embryonic carcinoma cells and embryonic fibroblasts led to ER stress and autophagy, and knockdown of PERK-eIF2\u03b1 could significantly suppress the upregulation of autophagy-related protein Atg12 and LC3-II ( Kouroku et al., 2007 ). Some other researchers demonstrated that ER stress mediated the occurrence of autophagy through the IRE1 pathway rather than the PERK pathway, and JNK inhibitors could suppress the expression of LC3, suggesting IRE1-TRAF2-JNK pathway plays a role in the induction of autophagy by ER stress ( Liu et al., 2010 ; Ogata et al., 2007 ; Tabas and Ron, 2011 ). Accumulating evidence also suggest that protective autophagy can be activated by ER stress, which may contribute to chemotherapy resistance in lung epithelial cells and cervical cancer cells, as well as in the digestive tract malignancies ( Lim et al., 2010 ; Yang et al., 2010 ; Xu et al., 2012 ). In present study, we found autophagy was induced by bufalin in SGC7901 and BGC823 cells, evidenced by the increased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and the degradation of p62. In addition, we found IRE1 knockdown significantly restrained LC3-II accumulation and p62 degradation induced by bufalin; whereas, CHOP knockdown showed no significant influence on autophagy progress, suggesting the IRE1 pathway was involved in ER stress-induced autophagy. To determine whether the autophagy promoted cell survival or cell death in HGC cells, autophagy was blocked with 3MA pretreatment or Atg5 siRNA. Autophagy inhibition significantly promoted bufalin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that bufalin induced protective autophagy in HGC cells. In accordance with our reports, Shuying Shen et al. reported that blockage of autophagy increased expression of ER stress-associated proteins and the ratio of apoptosis, suggesting autophagy played a cytoprotective role in bufalin-induced ER stress and cell death ( Shen et al., 2014 ). By contrast, Chuan-Ming Xie et al. demonstrated bufalin induces autophagy-mediated cell death in HT-29 and Caco-2 human colon cancer cells through reactive oxygen species generation and JNK activation ( Xie et al., 2011 ). This may be explained by the difference in tumor cell types and concentration of bufalin. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that bufalin suppressed the proliferation of human gastric cancer cell lines, SGC7901 and BGC823 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and promoted ER stress-mediated apoptosis. In addition, bufalin-induced ER stress led to the occurrence of autophagy through IRE1 pathway and JNK activation. Blockage of autophagy accelerated bufalin-induced apoptosis in HGC cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture HGC cell lines BGC823, SGC7901 and one normal gastric mucous epithelium cell (GES-1) were obtained from the Type Culture Collection Cell Bank (Chinese Academy of Sciences Committee, Shanghai, China) and were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; EU GIBCO), 100\u2005U/ml penicillin and 10\u2005\u03bcg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C. Cell proliferation assays The cell viability was determined using the CCK-8 kit based on the manufacturer's instructions. BGC823, SGC7901 and GES-1 were plated at a density of 3\u00d710 3 cells per well in 96-well microtiter plates and cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO 2 . After treatment with 20, 50, 80, 100, 150 and 200\u2005nmol/l of bufalin for 48\u2005h, or 80\u2005nmol/l of bufalin for 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4\u2005days, the culture medium was replaced with 100\u2005\u03bcl of fresh medium followed by the addition of 10\u2005\u03bcl of CCK-8 solution. The cells were further incubated for 2\u2005h before the optical density at 450\u2005nm was recorded. The effect of bufalin on proliferation was assessed by Trypan Blue exclusion assay (Beyotime, Haimen, China). Trypan Blue staining was evaluated under the microscope and the number of viable cells (unstained blue) was counted using a hemocytometer. Detection of cell cycle Phase distributions of the cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5\u00d710 6 cells per well in 6-well plates, and exposed to 0, 50 and 80\u2005nmol/l bufalin for 48\u2005h. Then the cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS and fixed with 75% ethanol at 4\u00b0C for 12\u2005h. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated with 20\u2005mg/ml RNase A and 10\u2005mg/ml PI for 30\u2005min in the dark. Finally, the cells were analyzed with flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometery Systems, San Jose, CA, USA) and the data were analyzed using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Detection of cell apoptosis Cell apoptosis was detected using Annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometry. Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5\u00d710 6 cells per well in 6-well plates. After treatment with different reagents for 48\u2005h, the cells were collected, washed with PBS, and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) by the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Flow cytometric analysis was performed immediately using a Beckman Coulter Epics Altra II cytometer (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). RNA interference To knock down the gene expression of IRE1, CHOP and Atg5, the sense sequences of siRNA oligonucleotides targeting the transcripts of IRE1, CHOP and Atg5 were transfected into BGC823 and SGC7901 cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Mismatch sequences were used as a negative control. Sequences for the IRE1, CHOP and Atg5 siRNAs were described in previous literature ( Shi et al., 2011 ). After incubation with siRNAs for 48\u2005h, the cells were treated with bufalin for 48\u2005h and harvested for use in cell apoptosis and western blot assays. Western blot analysis The cells treated with different reagents for 48\u2005h were collected and lysed using RIPA lysis buffer with proteinase inhibitor. The determination of total protein concentration was performed using the Protein BCA Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, USA). Then equal amounts of cell lysate mixed with 2\u00d7 SDS loading buffer were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, USA). After blocking with 10% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 50\u2005min, the membrane was incubated with 10% nonfat milk containing primary antibodies against IRE1 (1:1000, #3294, CST), p-eIF2\u03b1 (1:1000, #9721, CST), CHOP (1:1000, #2895, CST), Bcl-2 (1:500, sc-509, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bax (1:500, sc-20067, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PARP (1:500, sc-7150, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caspase-3 (1:1000, #9665, CST), caspase-8 (1:1000, #9746, CST), JNK (1:1000, #9251, CST), LC3 (1:1000, #2775, CST), Beclin-1 (1:1000, #3738, CST), Atg5 (1:1000, #2630, CST), p62 (1:2000, ab56416, Abcam) and \u03b2-actin (1:1000, #4967, CST) for 2\u2005h at room temperature. After washing, the membrane was incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1\u2005h at room temperature. The bands were visualized with ECL western blotting detection reagents. An anti-\u03b2-actin antibody was used as a protein loading control. Statistical analysis All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Data are expressed as mean\u00b1s.e. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t -test for comparison of two groups or ANOVA post hoc test for comparison of more than two groups. A P -value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Footnotes The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

Qureshi PDF ABSTRACT Activated fibroblasts are considered major drivers of fibrotic disease progression through the production of excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) in response to signals from damaged epithelial and inflammatory cells. Nevertheless, epithelial cells are capable of expressing components of the ECM, cross-linking enzymes that increase its stability and are sensitive to factors involved in the early stages of fibrosis. We therefore wanted to test the hypothesis that epithelial cells can deposit ECM in response to stimulation in a comparable manner to fibroblasts. We performed immunofluorescence analysis of components of stable, mature extracellular matrix produced by primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells and renal fibroblasts in response to cytokine stimulation. Whilst fibroblasts produced a higher basal level of extracellular matrix components, epithelial cells were able to deposit significant levels of fibronectin, collagen I, III and IV in response to cytokine stimulation. In response to hypoxia, epithelial cells showed an increase in collagen IV deposition but not in response to the acute stress stimuli aristolochic acid or hydrogen peroxide. When epithelial cells were in co-culture with fibroblasts we observed significant increases in the level of matrix deposition which could be reduced by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) blockade. Our results highlight the role of epithelial cells acting as efficient producers of stable extracellular matrix which could contribute to renal tubule thickening in fibrosis. INTRODUCTION Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health burden with a prevalence exceeding 10% in the adult population ( Mills et al., 2015 ). CKD is characterised by a reduction in glomerular filtration rate and increased urine albumin excretion caused by damage to the kidney ( Eckardt et al., 2013 ). This can lead to end-stage renal failure and may also be associated with co-morbidities through broader effects on body homeostasis. CKD shares patho-biology with other fibrotic diseases and represents a major challenge in global health. The progressive deposition and accumulation of excess extracellular matrix (ECM) is a defining feature of all fibrotic diseases. In the kidney, following nephron injury, the wound response leads to the production of ECM during the repair process ( Duffield, 2014 ). In the case of chronic kidney disease, this repair process fails to resolve and the continuing accumulation of matrix leads to progressive fibrosis and scarring. The accumulation of ECM and kidney fibrosis correlates closely with the decline in kidney function and are consistent features of end-stage CKD ( Genovese et al., 2014 ). Kidney fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are believed to be the major effector cells that both synthesise and deposit fibrillary ECM components in renal interstitial fibrosis ( Strutz and Zeisberg, 2006 ). These cells can be activated by cytokines including transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) ( Strutz et al., 2001 ; Zeisberg et al., 2000 ; Ignotz and Massague, 1986 ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) ( Guo et al., 2001 ; Stenvinkel et al., 2005 ) as well as stress stimuli including hypoxia ( Norman et al., 2000 ). These factors can lead to increased production of matrix components including fibronectin, collagen I and collagen III. The role of the epithelial cell in matrix deposition during fibrosis is less well established, although they can clearly respond to fibrotic stimuli and produce components of the extracellular matrix ( Orphanides et al., 1997 ; Ng et al., 1998 ; Humphreys et al., 2010 ). Regardless of whether these tubular epithelial cells undergo full conversion to a myofibroblast phenotype, they are positioned such that they could make a significant contribution to tubular thickening and dysfunction if they were to deposit significant amounts of stable ECM ( Louis and Hertig, 2015 ). An additional mechanism through which epithelial cells can contribute to the progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix is through the production of enzymes such as TG2 and LOXL enzymes. These can cross-link components of the extracellular matrix to increase matrix stability ( Gross et al., 2003 ; Kleman et al., 1995 ) as well as increasing its resistance to degradation ( Johnson et al., 1999 ). Previous studies have typically examined the ability of pro-fibrogenic cytokines to increase ECM synthesis as well as the changes in the relative production of ECM proteins ( Forino et al., 2006 ). These studies have been influential in building our understanding of pro-fibrogenic cytokines and growth factors. However they did not necessarily establish an effect on mature ECM. Studies in rodent cell lines again highlight this production but do not address the relative capacity of epithelial cells compared to fibroblasts in human cells ( Creely et al., 1992 ). The latter is important as epithelial cell expression of matrix components has been reported in diabetic nephropathy ( Razzaque et al., 1995 ), and we frequently observe in our animal models of tubulointerstitial fibrosis the expansion of the ECM before clear cellular infiltration ( Fig. S1 ). We have therefore developed an immunofluorescence assay using human epithelial cells where we strip the cellular components to allow us to focus directly on the remaining deposited ECM. Using this assay we have sought to test the hypothesis that primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells can deposit an ECM of comparable quality and quantity to primary renal fibroblasts, and that this is brought about in part by fibroblast-epithelial cell crosstalk. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Characterisation of primary epithelial cells and fibroblasts In order to study the deposition of matrix from human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) and human renal fibroblasts (HRFs) we wanted to perform analysis on human cells that were as close to their primary sources as possible for optimal translational relevance. We purchased primary isolations of these cell types and performed an initial characterisation. As expected, the epithelial cells showed high expression of cytokeratin 18, and were Thy1.1 negative ( Fig. 1 A,B). In addition, these cells were \u03b1-smooth muscle actin negative and showed low to undetectable levels of Fsp-1. In contrast the fibroblasts were negative for cytokeratin 18 staining, showed strong staining for Thy1.1 and FSP1, and approximately 30% were \u03b1-smooth muscle actin positive ( Fig. 1 B). These phenotypes remained stable up to six passages ( Fig. 1 C) and cells were used for subsequent assays up to this point. This provided us with primary cultures of human renal cells in which we could investigate the accumulation of mature ECM. Download powerpoint Fig. 1.

Comparable deposition of fibrillar extracellular matrix by epithelial cells and fibroblasts Although fibroblasts are generally considered the primary cell contributing to the mature ECM, tubular epithelial cells express several components of the extracellular matrix including fibronectin and collagen IV ( B\u00fcrger et al., 1998 ; Razzaque et al., 1995 ). Importantly, these cells also have the capacity to express the fibrillar collagens I and III which are associated with renal disease. We therefore wanted to study the accumulated matrix that was stably deposited by each cell type. Initially, we performed a comparison of the total extracellular matrix produced by epithelial cells and fibroblasts using an established radioactive 14 C amino acid incorporation assay to measure total deposited extracellular matrix. As expected, fibroblasts produced significant amounts of matrix under basal conditions and this was approximately doubled by treatment with TGF-\u03b21 ( Fig. 1 D). Whilst the ECM deposited by epithelial cells under basal conditions was approximately fourfold lower than HRFs, this was considerably increased in response to stimulation (three- to fivefold) reaching the basal level in fibroblasts. To understand in more detail the components and organisation of this mature deposited extracellular matrix, we used an imaging-based immunofluorescence approach to visualise key constituents of the mature extracellular matrix. This allowed us to investigate the fibrillar collagens that are associated with the fibrotic matrix. To do this, we first stripped away the cultured cells, fixed the deposited extracellular matrix, labelled matrix components using antibodies, then visualised and quantified this matrix by high-content imaging ( Fig. 2 A, and see Materials and Methods). Under basal conditions we observed comparable deposition of fibronectin by fibroblasts and epithelial cells ( Fig. 2 B-D). Basal deposition of collagen I and III obtained with fibroblasts was approximately two- to threefold higher than the levels obtained using epithelial cells. In contrast, epithelial cells readily deposited collagen IV but fibroblasts did not. Following stimulation with TGF-\u03b21, epithelial cells showed increases in the levels of all three ECM components which accumulated in a fibrillar matrix structure and at levels not significantly different to fibroblasts ( Fig. 2 B-D). Qualitatively, the fibroblast matrix appeared to have thicker collagen fibrils with areas that were sparse. In epithelial cells, the matrix was more even and composed of slightly thinner fibrils. Epithelial cells were therefore able to deposit an equivalent level of the fibrosis-associated matrix components to fibroblasts. Download powerpoint Fig. 2.

Results are the mean from four independent experiments with 6 replicates per experiment, t -test performed on means from independent experiments, ** P <0.01, *** P <0.001; error bars indicate mean\u00b1s.e.m. To understand if proliferation was responsible for this increased deposition of extracellular matrix we initially performed cell counts of epithelial cells following stimulation with TGF-\u03b21. Whilst we did not observe a significant increase in epithelial cell numbers ( Fig. 3 A), we observed increased expression of mRNA for the matrix components fibronectin, collagen I and collagen IV ( Fig. 3 B). Download powerpoint Fig. 3. Primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells activated by TGF\u03b21 have enhanced extracellular matrix production. (A) No change in cell counts of epithelial cells on stimulation with 10\u2005ng/ml TGF\u03b21.

Data shows mean\u00b1s.d. for four independent experiments. One-way ANOVA performed versus unstimulated control, **** P <0.001; * P <0.05. Taken together, these results show that epithelial cells are capable of producing a stable, fibrillar matrix with fibrosis-associated components in quantities comparable to fibroblasts in response to cytokine stimulation. Sensitivity of epithelial cells to stress stimuli, hypoxia and co-culture In vivo , the position of epithelial cells leaves them exposed to extracellular stresses which could trigger the onset of fibrosis. Chronic exposure to hypoxia ( Fine and Norman, 2008 ) or chemical stresses ( Debelle et al., 2002 ) in vivo lead to extracellular matrix deposition, fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. We therefore investigated the ability of two stress stimuli to induce matrix deposition in isolated epithelial cells: H 2 O 2 to generate oxidative stress ( Okamura and Pennathur, 2015 ), and aristolochic acid to mimic kidney injury ( Luciano and Perazella, 2015 ). In our isolated system, these triggers did not cause a significant increase in the stable deposition of fibronectin or collagen at concentrations that did not significantly affect cell number ( Fig. 4 A,B). Consistent with this, we did not see an increase in mRNA for fibronectin, collagen I, collagen III or collagen IV ( Fig. 4 C). This lack of induction may reflect the need for additional cell types such as immune cells to modulate the response, or the requirement for a more chronic stimulus to induce extracellular matrix deposition.

Data shows mean\u00b1s.d. for four independent experiments. Hypoxia is another stimulus that can induce fibrosis in vivo through HIF-1\u03b1 ( Higgins et al., 2007 ), and it also increases the expression of mRNA for extracellular matrix components ( Norman et al., 2000 ; Orphanides et al., 1997 ). We therefore tested the effects of hypoxia on epithelial cell ECM deposition. Although we did not observe a consistent increase in the stable deposition of fibrillar collagen I and III or fibronectin under hypoxic conditions, we did observe a large increase in collagen IV deposition that could be further increased by TGF-\u03b21 addition ( Fig. 5 ). Qualitatively, this matrix appeared to have a different structure. This is consistent with previous reports describing the sensitivity of these cells to hypoxia ( Norman et al., 2000 ; Orphanides et al., 1997 ) and demonstrating that additional mature ECM is deposited which could contribute to further tubule dysfunction. These results show that in isolated culture, the accumulated ECM response of epithelial cells, whilst relatively insensitive to chemical agents, could be significantly modulated by hypoxia. Download powerpoint Fig. 5. Response of RPTECs to hypoxia. (A) Epithelial cells grown for six days in either normoxic or hypoxic (2.5% O 2 ) conditions with or without stimulation with 10\u2005ng/mL TGF-\u03b21 were assessed for extracellular matrix production using the immunofluorescence assay.

(B) Representative images for deposited extracellular matrix components from epithelial cells in A. Scale bars: 100\u2005\u00b5m. As a result of the relative unresponsiveness of epithelial cells to acute stress stimuli, we tested whether other cell types could alter epithelial cell extracellular matrix production. Although fibroblasts have a well-established role as producers of extracellular matrix, they express several factors that could alter tubular epithelial cells behaviour ( Johnson et al., 1997 ). We co-cultured equal numbers of fibroblasts and epithelial cells and measured ECM by immunofluorescence. In the absence of exogenous stimulus, the co-culture of fibroblasts and epithelial cells resulted in higher levels of matrix deposition than could be accounted for by the same total cell number of either cell type alone and to a similar level as when stimulated by TGF-\u03b21 ( Fig. 6 A,B). This increase was most marked for collagen I and III where the increase was over threefold greater than could be accounted for by either a culture comprising solely fibroblasts, or, the expected level from a 50:50 culture of the two cell types. This suggested that these components and their fibrillar assembly were significantly affected by the interactions between cells. TGF-\u03b2 is a major fibrotic stimulus that can be produced and activated by both cell types which we have previously shown to drive the stable deposition of fibrillar extracellular matrix. Addition of an anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibody to an unstimulated co-culture of epithelial cells with fibroblasts resulted in over a fourfold reduction in matrix deposition of fibronectin and collagen I /III with little change in cell viability ( Fig. 7 A,B). These results highlight the role of TGF-\u03b2 as a major driver of ECM deposition in this co-culture system. Download powerpoint Fig. 6.

(B) Panels show representative images of cells from A. Scale bars: 100\u2005\u00b5m. In summary, we have developed an immunofluorescence-based method for quantifying the components of a mature, accumulated ECM using human cells. Importantly we have only assessed the mature assembled ECM by stripping the cellular component and only imaging the remaining ECM. This is key in that it represents not only an increase in transcription and translation (as demonstrated by previous studies), but also post translational modification, assembly of the ECM, as well as the homeostatic balance attained with change to ECM clearance systems such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and plasmin. In response to TGF-\u03b21, RPTECs demonstrated a clear deposition of ECM components including the fibrillary collagens I and III. Furthermore we have examined in a head-to-head comparison the capacity of epithelial and fibroblast responses to the most recognised pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-\u03b21 and shown that both cells have an almost equal capacity to generate components of a mature, deposited ECM. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for hypoxia in increasing ECM production from RPTECs and we confirm here that this is deposited as a mature, fibrillary extracellular matrix ( Norman et al., 2000 ; Orphanides et al., 1997 ). In contrast to cytokine stimulation and hypoxia, we observed a relative insensitivity of a mono-culture of epithelial cells to stress stimuli, and this may represent a missing component such as immune cells in this in vitro assay system ( Lupher and Gallatin, 2006 ). In this study we have not normalised to cell counts as ultimately the amount of matrix remaining was most important to the fibrotic process we were trying to model. We observed a modest decrease (10%) in epithelial cell counts and a modest increase of 20% in PrestoBlue signal, a marker of metabolic activity, so normalisation would not substantially alter the results (data not shown). Finally we observed that co-culture of epithelial cells and fibroblasts resulted in a largely TGF-\u03b2-dependent increase in basal matrix production. It is possible that as a result of tubule injury, interactions between fibroblasts and epithelial cells could be enhanced as in other fibrotic diseases ( Sakai and Tager, 2013 ; Gabison et al., 2009 ; Moll et al., 2013 ). This increase could be a result of enzymes such as LOXL2 or TG2 which could cross-link and stabilise the matrix ( Fisher et al., 2009 ). Alternatively renal fibroblasts have been reported to express TGF-\u03b2 ( Grupp et al., 2001 ) which could be activated by integrins expressed on epithelial cells ( Rabb et al., 1996 ; Hinz, 2015 ). Cross-talk between these cell types has been previously reported as rat tubular epithelial cells have been reported to influence fibroblast \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression ( Lewis and Norman, 1998 ). This is also similar to an interaction between podocytes and endothelial cells which altered the ECM ( Byron et al., 2014 ). Nevertheless many questions remain unanswered and the mechanism of this fibroblast-epithelial cross-talk is under active investigation. Whilst the contribution of epithelial cell-derived extracellular matrix to fibrosis in vivo is less clear, in diabetic nephropathy, epithelial cells show up-regulation of the extracellular matrix components collagen III and IV ( Razzaque et al., 1995 ), and basement membrane thickening is a hallmark of chronic kidney disease which often precedes the increase in fibroblasts in experimental models ( Fig. S1 ) ( Gilbert and Cooper, 1999 ). The epithelial cell, or the fibroblast-epithelial cell, cross-talk could therefore represent important therapeutic targets in fibrotic disease. Therefore consistent with our hypothesis, we have demonstrated that following cytokine stimulation, primary human epithelial cells can respond by producing a stable, fibrillar extracellular matrix that is comparable to that generated by activated fibroblasts. This ability to deposit ECM per se, especially the fibrillar collagens, as well as the enhanced deposition under hypoxic conditions and contact co-culture with fibroblasts, could make a significant contribution to fibrotic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and stimulations Human primary renal proximal tubular epithelial cells were purchased from Innoprot (Derio, Spain) and American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, USA) and were maintained in Renal Epithelial Cell Basal Medium (ATCC) supplemented with Renal Epithelial Cell Growth Kit Components (ATCC). Human primary renal fibroblasts were purchased from Innoprot and maintained in DMEM F12 (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS and supplemented with 2\u2005mM L-Glutamine. For experiments, epithelial cell medium was used for both cell types. Cells were grown in 100% humidity and 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C and were used until Passage 6. For hypoxia experiments, cells were grown in 2.5%O 2 and 5% CO 2 using a Panasonic MCO-19\u2005M incubator. For stimulation with cytokines, cells were incubated with TGF\u03b21 10\u2005ng/ml (RnD Systems, Minneapolis, USA) added at the start of the culture. Aristolochic acid and H 2 O 2 were from Sigma and were used at the indicated concentrations. For TGF-\u03b2 blockade, cells were incubated with anti-TGF-\u03b2 MAB1835 or appropriate isotype control (RnD Systems) for the duration of the culture period. Flow cytometry Cells were detached using Accutase and resuspended in staining buffer (PBS+0.2% BSA+0.1% sodium azide) before labelling as described for immunofluorescence with AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-cytokeratin 18 (LDK18, EBioscience, San Diego, USA) or FITC conjugated Thy1.1 (AF-9, Abcam). Cells were then washed and analysed using a BD FACSCanto. Histograms were prepared using FlowJo ( www.flowjo.com ). Extracellular matrix quantification by 14 C incorporation Cells were grown in medium containing either a 14 C-labelled amino acid mixture (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany) to measure total extracellular matrix or 14 C proline (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, USA) to measure collagens, using 0.75\u2005\u00b5Ci/ml of each radiolabel. Cells were grown in 96-well CytoStar-T plates (Perkin Elmer) for 6\u2005days. Cells were removed with 0.25\u2005M ammonium hydroxide in 50\u2005mM Tris pH 7.4 ( Fisher et al., 2009 ), washed with PBS, and deposition of radiolabelled protein measured using a TriLux 1450 Microbeta Scintillation Counter (Perkin Elmer). Immunofluorescence For immunofluorescence, cells were plated into 384-well or 96-well dark walled imaging plates (BD Biosciences, UK) in epithelial cell medium. For co-culture experiments, cells were plated in epithelial cell medium with equal total cell numbers. Cells were plated at 70% confluence and reached full confluence three days into the experiment. For cell stains, cells were grown for 6\u2005days before fixation using 4% PFA (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). Cells were permeabilised using 0.1% saponin (Life Technologies) in PBS before staining with anti-FSP1 (Cell Signalling Technologies, #13018), \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (Sigma) and Alexa Fluor488-conjugated cytokeratin 18 (EBioscience, San Diego, USA, clone LDK18). Cells were then washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor555 or 647 anti-species secondary antibodies and DAPI for nuclear staining (Life Technologies). For extracellular matrix stains, cells were first removed using 0.25\u2005M ammonium hydroxide in 50\u2005mM Tris pH 7.4 as previously described ( Fisher et al., 2009 ). Remaining matrix was then fixed using 100% methanol at \u221220\u00b0C followed by staining with Alexa Fluor488-conjugated anti-fibronectin (EBioscience, clone FN-3, 1 in 250 dilution), anti-collagen I and III (Merck Millipore, Billerica, USA, AB745 and AB747, 1:100 dilution) and eFluor660-conjugated anti-collagen IV (EBioscience, clone 1042, 1:100 dilution). Anti-collagen I and III were detected using Alexa Fluor555-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:500, Life Technologies). Image acquisition Images were acquired using a Cellomics Arrayscan (Life Technologies) with a 20\u00d7 Objective, ORCA-ER camera (for cells) or 10\u00d7 Objective, X1 camera (for ECM) and appropriate excitation and emission filter sets. Four images were acquired per well, with at least three replicate wells obtained in an experiment. For analysis of extracellular matrix fibrils we used the \u2018Cell Health Profiling\u2019 algorithm of the Cellomics Scan Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and used the entire image as the object. Staining above a fixed threshold was analysed and we measured the total intensity of the target. For analysis of nuclear area/counts, nuclei were detected as objects and the software reported counts and area data. RNA preparation and qRT-PCR Cells were cultured for 48\u2005h in 6-well plates, in the presence or absence of 10\u2005ng/ml TGF\u03b21. Medium was removed and the cell monolayer washed once with cold PBS. Total RNA was isolated using RNEasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant RNA was quantitated by spectrophotometry before being reverse transcribed using SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. TaqMan PCR was performed in triplicate wells using TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies) with 1\u2005\u03bcl cDNA/well. No Reverse Transcriptase (RT) and no template control wells were included in each experiment. The \u0394\u0394Ct method was used to normalise expression against the geometric mean of the housekeeper genes B2M , HMBS and TBP ( Table 1 ).

Moffat Biology Open 2017 6: 1434-1444; doi: 10.1242/bio.022863 Alessia Galasso PDF ABSTRACT Neurodegenerative tauopathies are characterised by accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates primarily degraded by autophagy. The 5\u2032AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is expressed in most cells, including neurons. Alongside its metabolic functions, it is also known to be activated in Alzheimer's brains, phosphorylate tau, and be a critical autophagy activator. Whether it plays a neurotoxic or neuroprotective role remains unclear. In tauopathies stress conditions can result in AMPK activation, enhancing tau-mediated toxicity. Paradoxically, in these cases AMPK activation does not always lead to protective autophagic responses. Using a Drosophila in vivo quantitative approach, we have analysed the impact of AMPK and autophagy on tau-mediated toxicity, recapitulating the AMPK-mediated tauopathy condition: increased tau phosphorylation, without corresponding autophagy activation. We have demonstrated that AMPK binding to and phosphorylating tau at Ser-262, a site reported to facilitate soluble tau accumulation, affects its degradation. This phosphorylation results in exacerbation of tau toxicity and is ameliorated via rapamycin-induced autophagy stimulation. Our findings support the development of combinatorial therapies effective at reducing tau toxicity targeting tau phosphorylation and AMPK-independent autophagic induction. The proposed in vivo tool represents an ideal readout to perform preliminary screening for drugs promoting this process. INTRODUCTION The microtubule (MT)-associated protein tau regulates assembly and stability of MTs ( Lee et al., 2001 ). In physiological conditions, tau is in a dynamic equilibrium, on and off the MTs. Under pathological conditions, this equilibrium is perturbed, resulting in an abnormal increase in the aggregation-prone unbound tau fraction. The tau MT-binding ability is strongly dependent on tau phosphorylation status ( Ballatore et al., 2007 ). Several tau kinases have been identified ( Hanger et al., 2009 ) including 5\u2032AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) ( Thornton et al., 2011 ), a heterotrimeric Ser/Thr protein kinase complex composed of three highly conserved subunits: the catalytic \u03b1 subunit (\u03b11 or \u03b12) and two regulatory subunits (one each of \u03b21 or \u03b22 and \u03b31-3) ( Carling, 2004 ). First identified as a sensor of energy status able to maintain cellular energy homeostasis ( Hardie, 2011a ; Poels et al., 2009 ), AMPK is essential for cellular survival in most mammalian cells including neurons ( Metcalf et al., 2012 ). In the brain, AMPK activity is increased during energy stress ( Berger et al., 2006 ; Gadalla et al., 2004 ). However, activated AMPK (p-AMPK) is abnormally accumulated in tauopathies: neurodegenerative diseases associated with the pathological aggregation of tau ( Vingtdeux et al., 2011 ). Indeed, previously instances of AMPK activation have been reported to be detrimental to neuronal survival, suggesting that inhibition, rather than activation, of AMPK might be neuroprotective ( McCullough et al., 2005 ). For example, it has been shown that downregulation of AMPK activity is beneficial in both in vitro and in vivo models of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as in an in vivo mutant TDP-43 model of motor neuron disease ( Lim et al., 2012 ). In addition, recent studies implicate AMPK activity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a regulator of both tau phosphorylation and amyloidogenesis ( Thornton et al., 2011 ; Vingtdeux et al., 2011 ). More recently, Domise et al. (2016) assessed the contribution of AMPK\u03b12 activation in an in vivo model (mouse primary neurons) where they reported an increase of tau phosphorylation at multiple sites, whereas AMPK inhibition led to a rapid decrease of tau phosphorylation. Furthermore, in a mouse model of AD it has been demonstrated that AMPK mediates the synaptotoxic effects of A\u03b242 oligomers via phosphorylating tau at Ser-262 ( Guthrie et al., 2011 ), leading to spine loss in both hippocampal and cortical neurons. Interestingly, Ser-262 is a key residue required for tau-MT binding ( Tseng et al., 2008 ) and, when phosphorylated, a mediator of tau toxicity in a transgenic Drosophila model of AD ( Iijima et al., 2010 ). Several studies have suggested that AMPK is also required for macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy). Autophagy is a process in eukaryotic cells in which regions of cytoplasm, insoluble protein aggregates, damaged mitochondria, or invading pathogens are engulfed by a double membrane to form vesicles, fusing with lysosomes to degrade the contents ( Hardie, 2011b ). AMPK mediates autophagy activation directly by phosphorylation of the protein kinase that initiates autophagy, ULK1 ( Egan et al., 2011 ; Kim et al., 2011 ) and indirectly, through inactivation of the mTOR complex-1 by phosphorylating both TSC2 ( Inoki et al., 2003 ) and Raptor ( Hardie, 2008 ). A decrease in autophagic activity has been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders associated with the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, while increased autophagy has been shown to facilitate the clearance of aggregation-prone proteins and promote neuronal survival in mouse and fly models of tauopathies ( Berger et al., 2006 ; Caccamo et al., 2010 ; Majumder et al., 2011 ; Rodr\u00edguez-Navarro et al., 2010 ). The apparent separate roles of AMPK in both promoting tau phosphorylation and regulating autophagy are therefore important to analyse. They will inform how any future potential AMPK-directed pharmacological interventions might succeed. In the present study, we have attempted to identify the cascade of events mediated by AMPK that affect tau-induced toxicity using both a mammalian cell line and an in vivo Drosophila model of tauopathy. Drosophila has been widely used as an in vivo model for tauopathies, reiterating many features of the mechanisms underlying human tau-induced neurodegenerative disease, in particular the roles of tau solubility and phosphorylation ( Gistelinck et al., 2012 ). The Drosophila compound eye, allowing easy access, represents the most commonly used read-out to evaluate toxicity of neurodegenerative proteins, including tau. Indeed, targeted expression of either wild-type or mutant tau in the retina caused alterations in external eye structures, characterised by size reduction and rough appearance ( Pr\u00fc\u00dfing et al., 2013 ). The Drosophila eye tauopathy model thus constitutes a genetically sensitised system that allows the identification of modifier mechanisms by assessing its roughening as a quantitative readout of neurotoxicity ( Caudron et al., 2014 ). Additionally, Drosophila has proven to also be a powerful multicellular model for genetic and pharmacological manipulation of autophagy ( Nezis, 2012 ). Here we report an in vitro physical interaction of tau with AMPK and with active p-AMPK, and we demonstrate how AMPK modulation affects the phospho-status and stability of tau. Furthermore, in vivo , by overexpressing an AMPK constitutively active (AMPK\u03b11-CA) mutation, we exacerbate tau toxicity by increasing tau phosphorylation without corresponding autophagy activation. Interestingly, treatment with the autophagy activator rapamycin was able to rescue the additional toxicity. Our findings support the development of new therapies targeting tau clearance via AMPK-independent autophagic induction. RESULTS Tau and AMPK physically interact in vitro in intact mammalian cells It has been demonstrated that activated AMPK phosphorylated at Thr-172 (p-AMPK) is abnormally accumulated in all the major tauopathies, including AD ( Vingtdeux et al., 2011 ). To determine if AMPK and tau are able to physically interact, we chose a simple mammalian cell-line model (HEK293T cells). This cell line does not express tau ( Guthrie et al., 2011 ) and has been previously used to study AMPK-regulated events, including autophagy ( Kim et al., 2011 ). Additionally, it has recently been proposed as a non-neuronal cell model where tau pathology can be studied in a stable, viable and easily transfected human cell line ( Houck et al., 2016 ). N-terminal FLAG-tagged tau was transfected into HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitation of tau was performed with anti-FLAG antibody. Detection of co-immunoprecipitating species was performed by western blotting with an anti-AMPK\u03b1 antibody. Tau was found to co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous AMPK\u03b1 ( Fig. 1 A). Further validation for AMPK/tau interaction was provided by immunoprecipitating endogenous AMPK with an anti-AMPK\u03b1 antibody, whilst detecting the co-immunoprecipitating species with an anti-tau antibody ( Fig. 1 B). Similarly, by immunoprecipitating with an anti-phospho antibody against AMPK\u03b1 (p-AMPK\u03b1) we found that tau also physically interacts with active AMPK\u03b1 ( Fig. 1 C). Download powerpoint Fig. 1. Immunoprecipitation reveals a physical association between tau and AMPK\u03b1. (A) Lysates from HEK293T cells transfected with a pCMV\u2013Flag vector (negative control) and a pCMV\u2013Flag-tau were immunoprecipitated with ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel. Immunoprecipitates were analysed by western blotting, probing against AMPK\u03b1. Uncropped blots and input controls are shown in Fig. S1A,B . (B) Identical lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-AMPK\u03b1 antibody and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were analysed by western blotting, probing against total tau. Control blots are shown in Fig. S1C . (C) Interaction of tau with active AMPK (pAMPK\u03b1). Identical lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-AMPK\u03b1 (Thr172) antibody and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were analysed by western blotting, probing against total tau. Control blots are shown in Fig. S1D . AMPK\u03b11 affects exogenous tau stability in vitro It has previously been demonstrated that AMPK can phosphorylate tau at Ser 262 in a cell-free in vitro assay ( Vingtdeux et al., 2011 ), as well as by reintroducing the AMPK upstream activator LKB1 in to HeLa cells ( Guthrie et al., 2011 ). We now wished to determine the consequence of AMPK activity on tau phospho-status in our HEK293T intact cell model. To evaluate the effect of AMPK overactivation on tau, we used a constitutively active form of AMPK\u03b11 (myc-tagged AMPK\u03b11-CA). Alternatively, to evaluate the effect of reduced AMPK activity on tau, we used a kinase-dead (K45R) variant of the AMPK\u03b11 subunit (AMPK\u03b11-KD), previously demonstrated to act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of endogenous AMPK ( Crute et al., 1998 ). As reported in COS7 cell lines ( Crute et al., 1998 ), transfection of AMPK\u03b11-KD in to HEK293T cells led to a significant degradation of endogenous AMPK protein ( Fig. S2A , and quantification Fig. S2B ). Knockdown of endogenous AMPK via AMPK\u03b11-KD overexpression caused dramatic reductions in total tau soluble fraction levels (an 80% reduction, Fig. 2 A lanes 5-6, and quantification Fig. 2 B) compared to AMPK\u03b11-CA-transfected cells ( Fig. 2 A lanes 1-2), with a concomitant loss of some tau species. Download powerpoint Fig. 2. AMPK\u03b11 affects exogenous tau stability. (A) Extracts from HEK293T transfected as indicated were used for detection of flagged-tau and phospho-tau, probing with anti-Flag and anti-p262-tau antibodies respectively, and then normalised with respect to tubulin. (B) Tau stability quantification expressed as a ratio between tau/tubulin is shown in the graph. Data are shown as mean\u00b1s.d.; 8.25\u00b12.2 for tau wt+AMPK\u03b11-CA, 0.77\u00b10.24 for tau wt+AMPK\u03b11-KD. P values were calculated by one-way ANOVA. Asterisks indicate significant differences ( P <0.05). ** P <0.01, n \u22653 independent HEK293T transfections. (C) Quantification of phospho-tau species as a ratio between p262 tau/tubulin is shown in the graph. Data are shown as mean\u00b1s.d.; 0.37\u00b10.03 for tau wt+AMPK\u03b11-CA, 0.12\u00b10.005 for tau S262A+AMPK\u03b11-CA, 0.11\u00b10.01 for tau wt+AMPK\u03b11-KD. P values were calculated by one-way ANOVA. Asterisks indicate significant differences ( P <0.05). ** P <0.01, n \u22653 independent HEK293T transfections. In an attempt to identify the phosphorylation status of the different tau species detected, we co-transfected AMPK\u03b11-CA and FLAG-tagged tau S262A. Western blots of cells transfected with this mutant tau ( Fig. 2 A lanes 3-4) revealed that it migrated differently to the wild-type tau. Tau S262A protein displayed, as expected for a non-phosphorylatable mutant, a distinct migration pattern characterised by a faster mobility compared with the wild-type tau ( Fig. 2 A lanes 1-2). In particular, the tau S262A migration pattern allowed us, by comparison with the wild-type tau migration pattern, to identify and quantify ( Fig. 2 C) the tau species phosphorylated at Ser-262. Interestingly, the lost species in AMPK\u03b11-KD-transfected cells correspond to the Ser-262 phosphorylated species ( Fig. 2 A lanes 5-6). Thus, the genetic inactivation of endogenous AMPK, via AMPK\u03b11-KD, results in a lack of Ser-262 phosphorylated tau, as well as the loss of other species yet unidentified. This suggests that under normal conditions, the phosphorylation of tau by AMPK is an important determinant of tau stability and that Ser-262 is one of the sites involved in this process. AMPK interacts with tau in vivo In vivo interactions between human tau and Drosophila AMPK While HEK293T cells have been useful to determine the biochemical interactions of AMPK and tau within an intact cellular system, they are not representative of either neurons or an in vivo situation. Drosophila melanogaster models of tau toxicity have been widely used to investigate interactions. Using the binary system UAS-GAL4 ( Brand and Perrimon, 1993 ), it has been shown that misexpression of wild-type human tau in the fly, under the control of the retina-specific glass multiple repeat enhancer (GMR) ( Freeman, 1996 ), caused a moderate rough eye phenotype ( Wittmann et al., 2001 ). The tau-induced phenotype thus provides an excellent readout with which to assay tau toxicity ( Jackson et al., 2002 ). In order to investigate whether AMPK\u03b1 is a mediator of tau-dependent toxicity, we genetically downregulated endogenous Drosophila AMPK\u03b1 using RNA interference (RNAi dAMPK\u03b1) under the control of the retina-specific GMR driver. The presence of the hemizygous GMR driver ( Fig. 3 A) or the expression of RNAi dAMPK\u03b1 (data not shown) caused no appreciable visible external phenotype, indicating that expression of RNAi AMPK\u03b1 is not detrimental to the Drosophila eye. Co-expression of tau and RNAi dAMPK\u03b1 (GMR/+; tau/ RNAi dAMPK\u03b1) partially rescued the tau-induced eye phenotype as determined by scanning electron microscopy ( Fig. 3 A). Download powerpoint Fig. 3. Downregulation of Drosophila AMPK\u03b1 (dAMPK\u03b1) partially rescued the tau-induced degenerative eye phenotype. (A) Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the external eye of control flies (GMR/+), flies expressing tau (GMR/+; tau/+) and flies co-expressing tau and RNAi dAMPK\u03b1 (GMR/+; tau/ RNAi dAMPK\u03b1) under the control of the GMR-GAL4 driver. Scale bar: 100\u2005\u00b5m. (B) Quantitative analysis of tau-induced toxicity displayed as the cumulative distribution of ommatidial distortion coefficients (DC) obtained via QED analysis for control flies (GMR, green line), flies expressing tau (GMR tau, black line) and flies co-expressing tau and RNAi dAMPK\u03b1 (GMR tau RNAi dAMPK\u03b1, orange line) under the control of the GMR-GAL4 driver. Co-expression of RNAi dAMPK\u03b1 with tau reduced tau-induced ommatidial distortion, as indicated by the leftward shift of the DC distribution, compared to the distribution of ommatidial distortion coefficients for flies expressing tau alone. The SEM images are representative of the median DC values for each genotype. The phenotypes associated with the lower and upper DC values can be seen in Fig. S5 . GMR n =14, GMR tau n =14, GMR tau RNAi dAMPK\u03b1 n =25. Levels of significance for Mann\u2013Whitney directional tests are <0.01 for both the compared groups: GMR versus GMR tau and GMR tau versus GMR tau RNAi dAMPK\u03b1. Validation of dAMPK downregulation upon expression RNAi dAMPK\u03b1 under the control of the GMR-GAL4 driver can be seen in Fig. S3B . To provide a quantitative evaluation of the eye phenotype, we used a statistical procedure, Quantitative Edge Detection (QED), for the assessment of ommatidial distortion in terms of deviation from ommatidial roundness caused by transgenic manipulations of the eye ( Caudron et al., 2014 ). The distortion coefficient (DC) ranges from 0 for no distortion to 1 for maximal distortion. Comparison of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images from GMR/+ and GMR/tau-expressing eyes showed that the distribution of ommatidial distortion was significantly different between the two, as quantified by the mean DC values (\u00b1s.d.; 0.201\u00b10.015, n =15 and 0.409\u00b10.070, n =15, respectively; Fig. 3 B green and black line, respectively). QED analysis confirmed the reduced severity of the GMR/tau/RNAi dAMPK genotype compared with the GMR/tau alone, seen upon visual examination of the SEMs, via a leftward shift in the cumulative distribution of DC (mean DC=0.317\u00b10.037, n =25; respectively, Fig. 3 B orange line). AMPK enhances tau neurotoxicity in a Drosophila model In order to recapitulate the human AMPK/tau pathway in our in vivo Drosophila model, we co-expressed human tau with the relevant human AMPK\u03b11 mutants previously characterised in vitro and assayed the resultant toxicity. Several insertion lines for both transgenes were used for the initial experiments; the results for two lines of the human AMPK\u03b11-CA transgene (hereafter AMPK\u03b11-CA) and three lines of the human AMPK\u03b11-KD transgene (hereafter AMPK\u03b11-KD) were used for initial SEM analyses and similar results were obtained for each transgene (data not shown). The overexpression of the AMPK\u03b11 transgenes under the control of the GMR-GAL4 driver in the resulting AMPK\u03b11-CA and AMPK\u03b11-KD lines were validated by western blot ( Fig. S3A,B ). The overexpression of those transgenes caused no appreciable external eye phenotype ( Fig. S4A,B ). Co-expression of tau and AMPK\u03b11-CA (GMR/+; tau/AMPK\u03b11-CA) caused an exacerbation of the toxic tau eye phenotype ( Fig. 4 A). By using QED, we found a significant shift to the right of the DC distribution and an increase in the mean DC when compared to both control and tau alone (0.488\u00b10.073, n =10; Fig. 4 B, blue line).

The SEM images are representative of the median DC values for each genotype. The phenotypes associated with the lower and upper DC values, can be seen in Fig. S6 . GMR tau n =14, GMR tau+ AMPK\u03b11-CA n =9, GMR tau+ AMPK\u03b11-KD n =12. Levels of significance for Mann\u2013Whitney directional tests are <0.01 for both the compared groups: GMR tau versus GMR tau+ AMPK\u03b11-CA and GMR tau versus GMR tau+ AMPK\u03b11-KD. Validation of AMPK\u03b11 overexpression in transgenic lines AMPK\u03b11-CA and AMPK\u03b11-KD under the control of the GMR-GAL4 driver can be seen in Fig. S3A,B . In contrast, co-expression of tau and AMPK\u03b11-KD (GMR/+; tau/AMPK\u03b11-KD) ameliorated the basal tau phenotype. Quantitative analysis using QED validated the SEM analyses (mean DC=0.314\u00b10.018, n =12) and the rescue resulted in a shift to the left of the DC distribution compared with tau alone ( Fig. 4 B red line and black line, respectively). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that AMPK activation can promote tau toxicity in this model. AMPK\u03b11 overactivation promotes exogenous tau phosphorylation in vivo Phosphorylation of tau protein characterises human tauopathy disorders. To address whether AMPK overactivation-induced changes in tau toxicity coincide with changes in tau phosphorylation, we analysed tau phosphorylation in tau/AMPK\u03b11-CA flies. Western blots analyses of fly head extracts in tau/AMPK\u03b11-CA-expressing flies showed that AMPK plays an important role in the phosphorylation of tau: increased AMPK activity drives tau phosphorylation in the fly, as shown in Fig. 5 A, where samples were probed with antibody against total tau (upper panel), against p262 (middle panel) and against actin (lower panel) and quantified ( Fig. 5 B). This analysis revealed that tau in tau/AMPK\u03b11-CA flies is strongly phosphorylated in comparison to the flies expressing tau alone ( Fig. 5 B). Download powerpoint Fig. 5.

Probing our samples with antibodies against total or phospho tau, we observed that tau protein runs with a specific electrophoretic profile, characterised by a strong \u223c60\u2005kDa band and an additional lower band (\u223c55\u2005kDa). Previous work has shown that pathologically hyperphosphorylated (including pSer-262) human tau band runs at \u223c60\u2005kDa, whereas the normally phosphorylated tau runs in the range of 55\u201360\u2005kDa ( Ali et al., 2012 ; Le Corre et al., 2006 ). Consistent with this observation, AMPK overactivation caused an increase in the immunoreactivity for the pathologically hyperphosphorylated species, as showed in Fig. 5 C where we quantified the immunoreactivity for p262 of the upper mobility band. AMPK\u03b1 downregulation destabilises pathological tau species and changes tau phosphorylation pattern To address whether the reduced tau toxicity associated with AMPK downregulation ( Fig. 4 B) coincides with changes in tau protein phosphorylation, we analysed tau protein in both tau/dAMPK RNAi and tau/AMPK\u03b11-KD flies. Analysis of western blots showed that as in HEK293T, AMPK plays an important role in the stability of tau as downregulation of AMPK activity, both via RNAi and AMPK\u03b11-KD, and drives tau protein destabilisation ( Fig. 5 D). Interestingly, AMPK downregulation caused a shift to the higher mobility band and a reduction in the immunoreactivity for the pathologically hyperphosphorylated species, as showed in Fig. 5 E where we quantified the reduction of the slower mobility upper band. Probing our samples with an antibody against tau phosphorylated on Ser-262 (p262), we validated that the pathologically hyperphosphorylated band consists of tau hyperphosphorylated at Ser-262 and the immunoreactivity for that band is reduced by AMPK downregulation ( Fig. 5 F,G). This is again supportive of a link between AMPK downregulation and neuroprotection. The catalytic subunit of AMPK influences autophagy in the Drosophila eye. It has been demonstrated that Ref(2)P, the homologue of mammalian p62, is a major component of protein aggregates formed during normal aging in the adult fly brain. It also accumulates in protein aggregates in flies that are defective in autophagy and in models of human neurodegenerative diseases ( Nezis et al., 2008 ). Accordingly increases in Ref(2)P are interpreted as reflecting dysfunctional autophagy. Given AMPK's known roles in autophagy activation, we sought to test the autophagy status in our transgenic fly models. We therefore assayed Ref(2)P accumulation in tau, tau/AMPK\u03b11-CA and tau/AMPK\u03b11-KD flies head extracts. In our model, we detected no changes in Ref(2)P accumulation in tau/AMPK\u03b11-CA compared to tau alone ( Fig. 6 A, quantification Fig. 6 B), demonstrating that overexpression of AMPK\u03b11-CA, which caused an exacerbation of tau-dependent toxicity, did not affect autophagy activation. In contrast, Ref(2)P accumulated in tau/AMPK\u03b11-KD flies ( Fig. 6 A,B) compared to tau alone. This suggests that the downregulation of endogenous AMPK impairs autophagy.

Level of significance for a Mann\u2013Whitney directional test is <0.01. Pharmacological activation of autophagy by rapamycin decreases AMPK\u03b11-CA tau-mediated toxicity In order to test whether induction of autophagy downstream of AMPK\u03b11-CA was beneficial in AMPK\u03b11-CA-mediated tau-dependent toxicity, we fed rapamycin to flies co-expressing tau and human AMPK\u03b11-CA (tau/AMPK\u03b11-CA) and analysed the eye phenotypes. Whereas 0.1\u2005\u00b5M rapamycin had no effect (data not shown), 1\u2005\u00b5M treatment ameliorated the tau AMPK\u03b11-CA mediated exacerbation of the toxic tau eye phenotype, compared with the same genotype fed with DMSO ( Fig. 6 C). QED quantitative analysis validated the SEM analyses (DC=0.64\u00b10.10, n =9 for DMSO control flies versus 0.51\u00b10.11, n =7 for rapamycin-treated flies) and the rescue resulted in a clear shift to the left of the DC distribution compared with DMSO-treated flies ( Fig. 6 D black line and red line, respectively). Collectively, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that induction of autophagy downstream of AMPK-mediated tau phosphorylation is beneficial in reducing tau-dependent neurodegeneration. DISCUSSION The exact role of AMPK in neurodegeneration is still highly controversial. It has been reported that a beneficial outcome of AMPK activation is to promote neuronal maintenance under normal conditions and upon metabolic stress. Studies in Drosophila have strengthened this notion demonstrating that AMPK deficiency causes neurodegeneration ( Poels et al., 2009 ; Ronnett et al., 2009 ). However, AMPK activation has also been found to be detrimental to neuronal survival ( Li et al., 2006 ; McCullough et al., 2005 ). Downregulation of AMPK has been reported to be beneficial in models of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as in an in vivo model of motor neuron disease ( Lim et al., 2012 ). In addition, recent studies implicate AMPK activity in the pathogenesis of AD as a regulator of both tau phosphorylation and amyloidogenesis ( Thornton et al., 2011 ; Vingtdeux et al., 2011 ), and the contribution of AMPK\u03b1 activation has been assessed in mouse primary neurons where an increase of tau phosphorylation at multiple sites upon endogenous AMPK activation has been reported, whereas AMPK inhibition led to a rapid decrease of tau phosphorylation ( Domise et al., 2016 ). Among its different roles, AMPK activates autophagy ( Egan et al., 2011 ; Hardie, 2008 ; Inoki et al., 2003 ; Kim et al., 2011 ), the main pathway for eukaryotic cells to degrade organelles and long-lived proteins ( Jaeger and Wyss-Coray, 2009 ). Interestingly, defective autophagy has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several major neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD ( Nixon and Yang, 2011 ). Additionally, defects in autophagy lead to an increased accumulation of tau phosphorylated at the KXGS motifs ( Wang et al., 2009 ) such as Ser-262, a species also reported to be less susceptible to proteasomal degradation mediated by Hsp90 ( Dickey et al., 2006 , 2007 ). In the present study, we assessed in a Drosophila in vivo model the contribution of AMPK modulation to tau-mediated toxicity. We initially established whether AMPK physically interacts with tau in HEK293T cells. Using immunoprecipitation, we found that AMPK can interact with tau ( Fig. 1 A,B) as can the active form of AMPK ( Fig. 1 C). Attempting to define the simplest and most effective way to increase AMPK activity, we took advantage of the AMPK\u03b11-CA mutation. This mutation frees the catalytic \u03b1-subunit from its regulatory \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits ( Woods et al., 2000 ) rendering it constitutively active. Using a Drosophila model expressing human tau in the developing fly eye we examined in vivo the effect of AMPK\u03b11-CA on tau toxicity. In these flies we exacerbated tau toxicity as determined by analysis of ommatidial distortion ( Fig. 4 ). Comparative analysis of protein lysates from flies overexpressing tau\u00b1AMPK\u03b11-CA showed that co-expression of AMPK\u03b11-CA significantly elevated the immunoreactivity of pSer-262 ( Fig. 5 A). Previously, in a cell-free in vitro assay, AMPK has been demonstrated to phosphorylate tau at Ser-262 ( Vingtdeux et al., 2011 ). Phosphorylation at Ser-262 is significantly elevated in human AD pre- and intra-neuronal tangles ( Augustinack et al., 2002 ). Consequently, phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 by AMPK may represent an important event in the early stages of AD pathogenesis. It has been proposed that tau phosphorylated at such KXGS motifs is likely to be resistant to proteasomal degradation ( Dickey et al., 2006 , 2007 ) and to accumulate when autophagy is defective ( Wang et al., 2009 ). Indeed, in some of our lines, we found that AMPK\u03b11-CA overexpression resulted in increased exogenous tau stability (data not shown). We have also demonstrated that downregulating AMPK activity affects tau in both in vitro and in vivo models. In fact, we established that when endogenous AMPK activity is decreased using dominant-negative AMPK\u03b11-KD in HEK293T cells, soluble tau levels also decrease. This relationship was particularly evident in pathologically phosphorylated species ( Fig. 2 A lane 5-6, Fig. 2 B). In the fly, we downregulated dAMPK by using two independent means: dAMPK-RNAi-mediated silencing, and by overexpressing the human AMPK\u03b11-KD. In both cases, by reducing endogenous dAMPK, we reduced the tau-induced toxicity ( Figs 3 and 4 ). Particularly, the diminished tau toxicity is likely due to a reduction in both tau phosphorylation and stability: lowering AMPK in vitro via expression of AMPK\u03b11-KD altered the phosphorylation profile of tau and led to compromised soluble tau stability in cells ( Fig. 2 ). In vivo , analysis of protein lysates from flies expressing tau ( Fig. 5 ) revealed the presence of a distinct doublet, with one band having a higher electrophoretic mobility. This indicates the presence of a population of tau species at a different phosphorylation status, which results in different electrophoretic migration. It has been proposed ( Ali et al., 2012 ; Le Corre et al., 2006 ) that pathologically hyperphosphorylated (including pSer-262) human tau bands run at 64\u2005kDa, whereas the normally phosphorylated tau runs in the range of 55\u201360\u2005kDa. Interestingly, in tau\u00b1RNAi dAMPK or AMPK\u03b11-KD flies we observed how the reduction of AMPK activity affects the levels and distribution of tau proteins ( Fig. 5 D,F). Specifically, reduced AMPK levels decreased the overall levels of pathological tau high molecular species, resulting in a band shift in the migration of total ( Fig. 5 D) and pSer-262 ( Fig. 5 F) tau species. In addition, the marginal but still detectable immunoreactivity of pathological tau high molecular weight species phosphorylated at Ser-262 is a clear indication that Ser-262 is not the only site phosphorylated in the pathological tau and the remaining immunoreactivity could be responsible for the residual toxicity in tau\u00b1RNAi dAMPK or AMPK\u03b11-KD fly. Our data are consistent with a detrimental effect of AMPK overactivation on tau-mediated toxicity. In our AMPK overactivation model we detected more toxic hyperphosphorylated tau. On the other hand, AMPK downregulation, preventing tau phosphorylation, destabilised the pathological tau species and rescued the tau toxic eye phenotype in the fly. How might this be explained with the observations of the direct ( Egan et al., 2011 ; Kim et al., 2011 ) and indirect ( Hardie, 2008 , 2011b ) activation of autophagy by AMPK and the attenuated tauopathy reported in different models after autophagy induction ( Congdon et al., 2012 ; Schaeffer et al., 2012 )? To attempt to answer this question we measured the levels of accumulation of Ref(2)P, the Drosophila orthologue of p62, a component of protein aggregates in flies defective in autophagy and models of human neurodegenerative diseases, in which it strongly accumulates ( Nezis et al., 2008 ). This approach allowed us to assess in our different experimental conditions the level of AMPK-mediated autophagy activation and to correlate that with the tau toxicity. As schematised in Fig. 7 , our data demonstrates that downregulation of AMPK activity via AMPK\u03b11-KD showed an accumulation of Ref(2)P ( Fig. 6 ). This is indicative of a reduction in autophagic flux, consistent with defective autophagy, as expected from mammalian models, where the expression of a dominant-negative form of AMPK completely inhibited autophagic proteolysis in HT-29 and HeLa cells ( Meley et al., 2006 ). From the work presented here our model demonstrates that in AMPK\u03b11-KD-tau flies, tau does not accumulate. Such flies do not need the beneficial effect of autophagy induction since they are likely to be able to clear tau via other degradative pathways. Consequently the AMPK-mediated autophagy downregulation does not affect the tau phenotype. Download powerpoint Fig. 7. AMPK-mediated tau phosphorylation and autophagy activation: model of action. Downregulation of AMPK via AMPK\u03b11-KD, although causing a reduction in the activation of autophagy, resulted in less tau toxicity, likely due to the reduction of tau phosphorylation and hence less toxic tau species. In contrast, overexpression of AMPK\u03b11-CA results in increased tau toxicity due to AMPK\u03b11-CA's ability to phosphorylate tau, thereby promoting the appearance of toxic tau species, without affecting autophagy, which would otherwise degrade such toxic species. Finally, overexpression of AMPK\u03b11-CA concomitant with pharmacological induction of autophagy, via rapamycin, resulted in rescued AMPK\u03b11-CA-mediated tau toxicity. Conversely, the increase in tau toxicity provoked by AMPK\u03b11-CA is due to the increased phosphorylation and possible reduced degradation of tau, concomitant with the inability of AMPK\u03b11-CA to effectively induce autophagy. Indeed, the lack of increased autophagic induction by AMPK\u03b11-CA has been previously demonstrated in HT-29 and HeLa mammalian cells ( Meley et al., 2006 ). Eventually, the reduction in tau toxicity found in AMPK\u03b11-CA-tau flies treated with rapamycin ( Fig. 6 C,D), is consistent with the beneficial outcome in autophagy induction downstream of AMPK. The Drosophila model presented in this paper demonstrates an ability to affect tau toxicity via AMPK-modulation in vivo . In human tauopathies, stress conditions result in AMPK overactivation and increased kinase activity, responsible for tau phosphorylation. Additionally, AD patients are known to be defective in autophagy activation ( Salminen et al., 2011 ). Our AMPK\u03b11-CA-tau model recapitulates this disease process by increasing tau phosphorylation, in particular at Ser-262, without corresponding autophagy activation. This site is reported to promote resistance to degradation ( Dickey et al., 2006 , 2007 ), leading to tau accumulation that requires autophagy for clearance. While AMPK is potentially able to offer protective effects through regulation of autophagy ( Egan et al., 2011 ; Hardie, 2008 , 2011a ; Kim et al., 2011 ), given the resulting increased phospho-tau levels as observed from the detrimental effects seen here in vivo for AMPK-CA, we propose that this results on balance in toxic accumulation of phospho-tau. Accordingly, our results indicate that pharmacological induction of autophagy downstream of AMPK may be beneficial in tau-dependent neurodegeneration. Taken together our findings raise the possibility that new therapies targeted at AMPK-mediated tau phosphorylation might be effective at reducing tau toxicity. The potential for such treatments to compromise autophagy are likely to be outweighed by the benefits associated with reducing phospho-tau toxicity. This opens the possibility of combinatorial therapy with treatments targeted at AMPK-independent autophagic induction to promote tau clearance. The Drosophila model presented here offers an opportunity to test the development of such drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines and transfection HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM of high glucose, supplemented with 10% FBS and grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol with empty pCMV-FLAG, pCMV-FLAG-tau (kind gifts of Dr Calum Sutherland, University of Dundee, UK), pCMV-FLAG-S262A tau or pCMV-FLAG-T231A tau plasmids in combination with empty pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pcDNA3 N-terminal-Myc-AMPK\u03b11-CA (kind gift of Prof. David Carling, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College, London, UK). pCMV-FLAG-tau is an N-terminal Flag-tagged human microtubule-associated protein tau isoform 2 (Genbank NP_005901.2 ), cloned into the pCMV FLAG-vector. pCMV-Myc Tag3b AMPK\u03b11-KD and pCMV-FLAG-S262A tau were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis respectively on pCMV-Myc Tag3b AMPK\u03b11-wt and pCMV-FLAG-tau, via site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies LDA UK, Stockport, UK). Fly stocks The transgenic fly line carrying the human 0N4R tau, with the four tubulin-binding domains (R) at the C-terminal region and no N-terminal insert (N), was a kind gift from Dr Mel Feany (Harvard Medical School, MA, USA) ( Wittmann et al., 2001 ). UAS-AMPK\u03b11-CA and UAS- AMPK\u03b11-KD transgenic lines were obtained by directional cloning of cDNAs, into the Drosophila expression vector, pUAST. Transgenic flies were produced by BestGene Inc. using standard procedures. UAS-AMPK RNAi flies were obtained from the VDRC (Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center, Vienna, Austria; Transformant ID 106200). All other fly stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (Indiana University, IN, USA). Crosses were maintained on standard cornmeal-based Drosophila medium at 25\u00b0C. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting HEK293T cells were recovered by gentle pipetting in PBS1X, centrifuged at 5000\u2005 g for 5\u2005min in a microfuge and resuspended in 0.5\u2005ml lysis buffer [50\u2005mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2005mM NaCl, 1\u2005mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1\u2005mM Sodium Orthovanadate, 50\u2005mM Sodium Fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche)]. After sonication for 15\u2005min and incubation on ice for 10\u2005min, samples were centrifuged at 15700\u2005 g for 30\u2005min. The supernatant was recovered and the protein concentration determined. Proteins were either directly analysed after electrophoresis, by western blotting (see below), or immunoprecipitated. In the second case, extracts were incubated under rotation for 2\u2005h at 4\u00b0C with ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma, A2220) according to manufacturer's instructions, or with the relevant antibody. In the latter case, Protein A-Sepharose (Generon, Slough, UK) was then added and the mixture incubated for a further 2\u2005h at 4\u00b0C. Sepharose beads were quickly centrifuged in a microfuge (2\u2032 at 8000\u2005rpm) and washed three times with lysis buffer. After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in 30\u2005\u00b5l Laemmli sample buffer, boiled 10\u2005min at 90\u00b0C and electrophoresed through a 10% acrylamide gel. Adult flies were collected, heads dissected and homogenised in a lysis buffer containing 50\u2005mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1\u2005mM EGTA, 1\u2005mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1\u2005mM Sodium Orthovanadate, 50\u2005mM Sodium Fluoride, 5\u2005mM Sodium Pyrophosphate, 0.27\u2005M Sucrose, 0.1% \u03b2-Mercaptoethanol and complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche). Protein content was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Extracts were mixed with SDS sample buffer and heated at 90\u00b0C for 10\u2005min before being separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Lysates or immunocomplexes subjected to SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Nitrocellulose blots were incubated at room temperature for 30\u2005min in blocking buffer [Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in 5% BSA with the recommended concentrations of indicated antibodies]. After washing three times for 15\u2005min each with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotechnology, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA), followed by washing. Immunoreactive bands were visualised with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Developed films were scanned using a flat-bed scanner and densities of bands were measured using ImageJ software (NIH). Membranes were immunoblotted with the following antibodies at the indicated dilutions: tau T46 (Abcam AB22261, 1:1000), tau phospho S262 (Abcam AB4856, 1:1000), tau phospho T231 (Abcam AB30665, 1:1000), AMPK\u03b1 (Cell Signaling, #2532, 1:1000), Phospho-AMPK\u03b1 (Thr172) (40H9) (Cell Signaling, #2535, 1:1000), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma, F3165, 1:5000), Anti-beta Tubulin (Abcam AB6046, 1:5000), anti-actin (JLA20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma, Ames, IA, USA; 1:2000), anti-Ref(2)P ( Wyers et al., 1995 ) (kind gifts of Dr Ioannis P. Nezis, Life Sciences, University of Warwick, UK; 1:1000). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) To analyse external eye structure using SEM, female flies were fixed overnight in 4% PFA in PBS1X at 4\u00b0C. Flies were then dehydrated through an acetone series (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% in H 2 O), incubating on a rotator in 1\u2005ml of solution for 15\u2005min at room temperature (RT). Flies were transferred to 100% acetone, for at least 2\u2005days at 4\u00b0C, and then attached to stubs using double-sided tape, sputter coated in gold for 60\u2005s and imaged using a Zeiss Supra55 VP SEM at 150\u00d7 magnification. Quantitative edge detection (QED) Software for assessing the level of ommatidial disruption in adult fly eyes (QED) was developed in collaboration with the Statistics Department at Warwick University, UK ( Caudron et al., 2014 ). For the purpose of this study, only data for the roundness measure (termed ommatidial distortion) has been used as it is a more sensitive measure, sampling hundreds of times per image as opposed to once per image for the distance and angle measures. Raw data from QED was collected and transferred to OriginLab software, version 4 ( http://www.originlab.com ) in order to produce cumulative plots of ommatidial distortion versus fly count (in percent of total). Significance levels were calculated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U -test. Rapamycin treatment Rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA, USA) was dissolved in DMSO (500\u2005\u03bcM stock) and added to fly food at 0.1\u2005\u03bcM and 1\u2005\u03bcM. For control food DMSO alone (0.02% and 0.2%, respectively) was added.

The molecular dynamics that occur at the NSD boundary relative to adjacent OV cells is not well defined. The Tbx1 transcription factor gene expression pattern is complementary to the NSD, and inactivation results in expansion of the NSD and expression of the Notch ligand, Jag1 mapping, in part of the NSD. To shed light on the role of Jag1 in NSD development, as well as to test whether Tbx1 and Jag1 might genetically interact to regulate this process, we inactivated Jag1 within the Tbx1 expression domain using a knock-in Tbx1 Cre allele. We observed an enlarged neurogenic domain marked by a synergistic increase in expression of NeuroD and other proneural transcription factor genes in double Tbx1 and Jag1 conditional loss-of-function embryos. We noted that neuroblasts preferentially expanded across the medial-lateral axis and that an increase in cell proliferation could not account for this expansion, suggesting that there was a change in cell fate. We also found that inactivation of Jag1 with Tbx1 Cre resulted in failed development of the cristae and semicircular canals, as well as notably fewer hair cells in the ventral epithelium of the inner ear rudiment when inactivated on a Tbx1 null background, compared to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 mutant embryos. We propose that loss of expression of Tbx1 and Jag1 within the Tbx1 expression domain tips the balance of cell fates in the NSD, resulting in an overproduction of neuroblasts at the expense of non-neural cells within the OV. INTRODUCTION The inner ear forms from the otic vesicle (OV), which is a closed, continuous epithelium consisting of cells that will differentiate to form specialized cell types ( Bok et al., 2007 ). The T-box transcription factor gene, Tbx1 , plays a major role in the OV for inner ear morphogenesis. Tbx1 is expressed in the posterior-lateral OV, mostly complementary to the region that forms the cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG) ( Ma et al., 1998 ; Raft et al., 2004 ). When Tbx1 is inactivated in the mouse, the CVG is duplicated in size, marked by an expansion in expression of Atonal -related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proneural transcription factors Neurogenin1 ( Ngn1 ; also known as Neurog1 ) and NeuroD ( Neurod1 ), in the neurogenic domain ( Raft et al., 2004 ). In addition, the cochlea and vestibular system do not develop ( Vitelli et al., 2003 ; Raft et al., 2004 ). However, failure of otic epithelial cells to proliferate normally in Tbx1 null mice may render it difficult to identify the range of its specific requirements ( Xu et al., 2007 ). Overexpression ( Funke et al., 2001 ) or constitutive expression of Tbx1 ( Freyer et al., 2013 ), on the other hand, has the opposite effect for neurogenesis, meaning that the neurogenic domain is reduced in area ( Freyer et al., 2013 ). In addition to this defect, the utricle and the saccule, containing hair cells derived from prosensory patches during early development, do not form. This suggests that Tbx1 may restrict neurogenesis and sensorigenesis. We are interested in understanding the mechanism for this, so we considered other genes that are required for these processes. The Notch ligand, Jagged1 (Jag1), and group B Sox SRY-related HMG box transcription factor (Sox2) are broadly co-expressed in the ventral region of the OV. Within these expression domains, exists a subdomain known as the neurosensory domain (NSD), the cells of which have the potential to differentiate into neurons, hair cells or support cells ( Adam et al., 1998 ; Cole et al., 2000 ; Daudet et al., 2007 ; Fekete and Wu, 2002 ; Kiernan et al., 2006 , 2005 ; Morsli et al., 1998 ; Neves et al., 2011 ; Pan et al., 2010 ; Raft and Groves, 2014 ). Mouse genetic studies show that inactivation of Jag1 results in failed development of prosensory patches early in development, and a reduction in the size of the neurogenic zone of the CVG ( Kiernan et al., 2006 ; Pan et al., 2010 ), suggesting that it may be required for neurosensory competence or maintenance. Sox2 expression is maintained by Jag1 and is also required for neurosensory specification ( Kiernan et al., 2006 ; Neves et al., 2011 ; Pan et al., 2010 ). Tbx1 appears to function in a complementary manner to Jag1. Little is known about the cellular and molecular dynamic requirements of cells in the NSD for proper inner ear development. Notch pathway genes have been implicated in tissue boundary formation during development in various contexts. Since loss of Tbx1 results in an expansion of the CVG and inactivation of Jag1 results in a somewhat smaller CVG ( Kiernan et al., 2006 ; Pan et al., 2010 ), we wanted to test whether the two genes might act antagonistically in the NSD for inner ear development. In this study, we utilized Tbx1 ( Huynh et al., 2007 ) and Jag1 ( Kiernan et al., 2006 ) conditional loss-of-function mouse mutants to evaluate their functions in the NSD, and found a surprising novel function in neurogenesis. RESULTS Expression of Tbx1 and Jag1 around the NSD Both Jag1 and Sox2 are markers of the NSD-containing cells required for neurogenesis and sensorigenesis ( Raft and Groves, 2014 ). We performed immunofluorescence studies to determine where and when Tbx1, Jag1 and Sox2 are expressed with respect to each other and to the NSD ( Fig. 1 ). At embryonic day (E) 9.5, Tbx1 was broadly expressed in the posterolateral wall of the OV ( Fig. 1 A, b-c\u2032; Fig. S1 ). As expected, Jag1and Sox2 proteins were expressed in a similar pattern to one another. Expression of the two was complementary to Tbx1 in the anterior domain, while there was some overlap in expression with Tbx1 in the posterior lateral OV ( Fig. 1 A, a-c\u2032). By E10.5, expression of all three genes became more restricted within their respective complementary domains, such that Jag1 and Sox2 had less overlap in expression with Tbx1 ( Fig. 1 A, d-f; Fig. S1 ). The complementary expression patterns between Tbx1 and Sox2/Jag1 and known loss-of-function phenotypes ( Raft et al., 2004 ; Pan et al., 2010 ; Puligilla et al., 2010 ) suggest that there might be an antagonistic relationship between them. We decided to focus on evaluating the relationship between Tbx1 and Jag1 in more detail, since there appeared to be a sharper border between Jag1 and Tbx1, than Sox2 and Tbx1, expression ( Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the two may interact genetically to form an important boundary within the OV. Another reason to focus our study on Jag1 is that Jag1 has been shown to function upstream of Sox2 during inner ear development ( Pan et al., 2010 ; Neves et al., 2011 ). Finally, Notch1 has been shown to function downstream of Tbx1 during neurogenesis in the OV ( Xu et al., 2007 ), providing additional rationale to further study its ligand, Jag1 , which had never been linked to Tbx1 up until this point. Download powerpoint Fig. 1. NSD gene expression in wild-type and Tbx1 null embryos. (A) Immunofluorescence was performed using antibodies to Jag1, Tbx1 and Sox2 on tissue sections from mouse embryos at E9.5 (a-c\u2032) and E10.5 (d-f\u2032). Jag1 and Sox2 are expressed broadly in the otic epithelium at E9.5, overlapping with Tbx1 expression in the PVL OV, but are largely complementary. By E10.5, Jag1 and Sox2 expression is mainly restricted to the anterior ventral lateral and posterior medial OV, with less overlap with Tbx1 expression, which is restricted to the posterior dorsal lateral OV. (B) Immunofluorescence was performed using antibodies to Jag1, Tbx1, Isl1 and NeuroD, as indicated (g-i\u2032). Jag1 is expressed in the NSD, where neuroblasts expressing both Isl1 (g) and NeuroD (h) are derived. Tbx1 is expressed complementary to Jag1 (i,i\u2032), as well as NeuroD (h), at the same border. The diagram below depicts the planes of sections used. (C) Schematic summarizing the wild-type expression of the genes examined in B, with respect to domains. (D) Immunofluorescence for Jag1 (red) on transverse sections in embryos at E9.5 and E10.5 was performed. The sections progress from the anterior to posterior domains of the OV. At E9.5, Jag1 expression expands in both the medial and lateral domain (white brackets), while at E10.5, Jag1 expression expands in the lateral domain (white brackets). (E) Immunofluorescence for Jag1 in Tbx1 GOF and littermate control embryos showing a shift in the expression from lateral (white arrow) to medial (yellow arrow) in anterior sections (p\u2032,q\u2032). At this point, in order to evaluate Tbx1 and Jag1 expression with respect to regions of neurogenesis, the expression of Jag1, Tbx1, Isl1, and NeuroD were compared ( Fig. 1 B). Jag1 was expressed in the region where neuroblasts expressing both Isl1 ( Fig. 1 B, g) and NeuroD ( Fig. 1 B, h) are derived, while Tbx1 was expressed in a largely complementary manner to these genes ( Fig. 1 B, i,i\u2032). This indicates that Tbx1 is excluded from the neurogenic domain within the NSD, marked by overlapping expression of Jag1 and NeuroD. A schematic of expression patterns is shown in Fig. 1 C, showing the expression patterns of these genes, with respect to one another and the NSD border. We also wanted to determine what effect loss or gain of Tbx1 would have on Jag1 expression and, indirectly, the NSD. At E9.5, Jag1 expression expanded anteriorly and posteriorly on the medial and lateral walls of the OV when Tbx1 was globally inactivated ( Fig. 1 D, j\u2032,k\u2032,l\u2032). By E10.5, Jag1 expression in wild-type embryos became restricted mostly to the posteromedial OV, with small regions of expression in the anterolateral wall of the OV ( Fig. 1 D, m,n,o). When Tbx1 was inactivated, Jag1 expression again expanded across the medial-lateral axis of the posterior OV ( Fig. 1 D, m\u2032,n\u2032,o\u2032). The expansion in Jag1 expression into the posterior OV correlated with the region of ectopic neurogenesis in Tbx1 \u2212/\u2212 OVs that has been previously described ( Fig. 1 B) ( Raft et al., 2004 ; Xu et al., 2007 ). We also examined the expression of Jag1 in Tbx1 GOF ( Pax2-Cre/+; Tbx1-GFP/+ ) ( Freyer et al., 2013 ) embryos ( Fig. 1 E), and found that the expression domain shifted from the anteroventral lateral to anteroventral medial OV ( Fig. 1 E, p,p\u2032). In control embryos, Jag1 is expressed in the medial OV in more posterior sections ( Fig. 1 E, q,r), whereas in in anterior sections, Jag1 expression is exclusively lateral ( Fig. 1 E, p). In contrast, in Tbx1 GOF embryos, Jag1 expression is almost exclusively medial throughout the OV, with significantly more coverage of the medial wall of the OV compared to controls, particularly in anterior sections ( Fig. 1 E, p\u2032,q\u2032,r\u2032). These findings indicate a change in the position of the medial-lateral border and shift of the NSD. Of note, cells within the anteroventral lateral region of the OV contribute to the CVG and utricle ( Fekete and Wu, 2002 ), the cells of which are derived from a shared lineage within the NSD ( Raft et al., 2007 ) We further asked whether there was mutual antagonism between Tbx1 and Jag1 , by examining Tbx1 expression in Jag1 null mice in the OV. There was some decrease in the area of Tbx1 expression, although this loss is likely secondary to the reduction in size of the OV ( Fig. S2 ). The position of the expression domain with respect to the OV appeared unaltered. These findings suggest that there is a unidirectional pathway by which Tbx1 restricts the Jag1 expression and the size and location of the NSD. Next, we performed cell lineage tracing of Tbx1 using a Tbx1 Cre mouse line ( Huynh et al., 2007 ) crossed with a GFP reporter line (Batista-Brito et al., 2009) in order to map the overlap between the Tbx1 lineage and Jag1 expression to know where Jag1 might be getting inactivated. We found that Jag1 partially colocalized with the Tbx1 cell lineage, marked by GFP in mostly the posterior ventral lateral (PVL) OV at E10 ( Fig. 2 A), but broadened to include the posterior medial domain at E10.5 ( Fig. 2 B). There was less overlap in the anteroventral region, adjacent to the CVG ( Fig. 3 A-C). On a separate note, there is another distinct Tbx1 lineage within the mesoderm surrounding the OV as well ( Fig. 2 B). The OV from the E10.5 embryo shown in Fig. 2 B was used for serial section 3D reconstruction ( Fig. 2 C). The purpose was to better visualize the areas of overlap between Jag1 and the Tbx1 cell lineage. This clarified that Jag1 expression occurred mostly at the border of the Tbx1 lineage, with overlap occurring primarily in the PVL and posterior ventral medial (PVM) domains, which contribute to the lateral SCC and, in part, the saccule and cochlea, respectively ( Fig. 2 C) ( Fekete and Wu, 2002 ). A very clear border between the Tbx1 lineage and Jag1 expression can been seen at the dorsal-ventral (white arrow) and medial-lateral (black arrow) axis ( Fig. 2 C). We also performed Tbx1 lineage tracing when Tbx1 was homozygously inactivated, in conjunction with antibody staining for NeuroD. Interestingly, this revealed that while the ectopic CVG that forms in Tbx1 null embryos is composed largely of cells derived from the Tbx1 cell lineage, a number of neuroblasts positive for NeuroD are GFP-negative (GFP \u2212 ), suggesting they are not derived from the Tbx1 lineage and could indicate nonautonomous roles ( Fig. S3 ). Previous findings that Jag1-Notch1 signaling plays a role in CVG formation ( Pan et al., 2010 ) and loss of Tbx1 affects aNotch expression ( Xu et al., 2007 ), provide a reasonable basis for speculating that Tbx1 may regulate CVG formation nonautonomously by affecting this cell signaling pathway. Another point worth noting is that it has been previously shown (and confirmed in this report) that the CVG and distal ganglia fuse in Tbx1 null embryos ( Xu et al., 2007 ). Thus, one might speculate that GFP \u2212 cells from this experiment are derived from epibranchial ganglia; however, these authors also show contribution of the Tbx1 cell lineage to epibranchial ganglia, particularly the IXth ganglion, when one allele of Tbx1 is inactivated ( Xu et al., 2007 ). Thus, some GFP + cells in this experiment may also derive from epibranchial ganglia. Download powerpoint Fig. 2. Tbx1 lineage is largely complementary to the NSD. (A,B) Immunofluorescence for Jag1 (red) and GFP (green) on transverse sections of a Tbx1 Cre/+ ;CMV-GFP flox/+ embryo at E10 and E10.5, showing largely complementary expression between Jag1 and the Tbx1 cell lineage in more anterior sections of the OV, but some colocalization (white arrows) in more posterior ventral regions. (C) 3D reconstruction of serial sections of the E10.5, Tbx1 Cre/+ ;CMV-GFP flox/+ embryo shown in Fig. 3 C, showing the position of expression of the Tbx1 lineage and Jag1 as well as co-expression of both genes. The Tbx1 cell lineage is shown in pink, Jag1 protein expression is shown in yellow, and the overlap between the two is shown in orange. A dorsal-ventral (white arrow) and medial-lateral (black arrow) border between the Tbx1 lineage and Jag1 expression is shown. Download powerpoint Fig. 3. The CVG is significantly smaller in size in Jag1 \u2212/\u2212 embryos compared to wild-type controls at E10.5. (A) Immunofluorescence using a Tuj1 antibody was performed to mark the CVG (traced with a white dashed line). (B) Schematic depicting the phenotype in A. (C) The average volume of the CVG marked by Tuj1 expression was measured and averaged per ear per genotype. Average OV volume was also calculated. Both CVG and OV volume in Jag1 \u2212/\u2212 embryos were significantly lower than in Jag1 +/+ embryos. Average neural tube length was also calculated to serve as a control for overall embryo size; there was no significant difference between genotypes. ( Jag1 +/+ embryos, n =3; Jag1 \u2212/\u2212 embryos, n =4). *** P <0.001; * P <0.05. Data are mean\u00b1s.e.m. Values were normalized to those of wild-type levels. To further delineate Tbx1 and Jag1 domains with respect to the NSD border, we also performed lineage tracing using a Pax3 C re ( Paired Box Gene 3 ) mouse line crossed with GFP reporter mice to mark the neural crest cell lineage. This lineage is present in the neurosensory regions of the inner ear, except for the cristae ( Freyer et al., 2011 ). Immunofluorescence on alternating serial sections at E9.5 demonstrated that Jag1 was expressed throughout much of the Pax3 lineage ( Fig. S4 , top; white brackets), while Tbx1 was complementary to this ( Fig. S4 , bottom; white arrowheads). When taken together, these data show that Tbx1 expression borders and restricts Jag1 expression, primarily in regions within the NSD that give rise to the utricle and CVG. Inactivation of Jag1 results in a significant reduction in the CVG size We evaluated E10.5 Jag1 \u2212/\u2212 versus Jag1 +/+ embryos using an anti-Tuj1 antibody, which marks differentiated neurons. We measured the area around the Tuj1 staining marking the CVG and found that there was a significant decrease in the average area of the CVG in Jag1 null embryos compared to wild-type controls, to \u223c50% of wild-type levels ( P <0.001) ( Fig. 3 ). This is a more drastic reduction than previously reported in Jag1 conditional loss-of-function embryos ( Pan et al., 2010 ). We also measured the area of the OV in these embryos and found that it was reduced in size to a similar degree in Jag1 null embryos ( P <0.05) ( Fig. 3 ). To ensure that differences were not due to changes in the overall embryo size, we also measured the length of the neural tube in these embryos and found that there was no significant difference on average ( Fig. 3 ). Dual inactivation of Tbx1 and Jag1 causes a synergistic expansion of neuroblasts in the absence of increased cell proliferation The above data indicate that Tbx1 and Jag1 are expressed in a largely complementary manner in the OV, but there is some overlap in expression in NSD border cells as well as in the posterior OV. Further, loss of Jag1 results in a 60% reduction in the size of the CVG, opposite to the phenotype resulting from a loss of Tbx1 . To shed light on the requirement of Jag1 at the NSD border, as well as to test whether Tbx1 and Jag1 might genetically interact, we inactivated Jag1 within the Tbx1 expression domain using a knock-in Tbx1 Cre allele. We first performed in situ hybridization using a Jag1 RNA probe showing that Jag1 expression was reduced in posterior and, to a lesser extent, anterior domains of the OV at E10.5 in Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/\u2212 as well as Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 floxflox mutant embryos, when compared to Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/+ and Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 littermate control embryos, respectively ( Fig. S5 ). These findings confirmed that Jag1 was inactivated within the Tbx1 lineage as expected. Note that Jag1 expression was also reduced in the pharyngeal apparatus, where the two genes also overlap in expression, but not in regions where they are not co-expressed, such as the forelimb ( Fig. S4 ). It is also important to note that resulting Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/+ conditional double heterozygous embryos also have reduced dosage of Tbx1 since the Cre is knocked into the endogenous Tbx1 locus, producing a functionally null allele ( Huynh et al., 2007 ). To test whether CVG development would be affected in resulting double mutants, RNA in situ hybridization was performed for NeuroD at E10 and E10.5. At E10, Tbx1 Cre/+ embryos exhibited a small, but visible, increase in NeuroD expression along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the ventral OV, compared to wild-type controls ( Fig. 4 A). Double heterozygous Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/+ embryos at E10, compared to Tbx1 Cre/+ embryos, exhibited a greater expansion in NeuroD expression. This expansion was along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the anterior OV, with the CVG rudiment appearing larger ( Fig. 4 A). We then inactivated both alleles of Jag1 by generating Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/\u2212 embryos. These embryos exhibited an even greater expansion in NeuroD expression along the D-V axis and posterior ventral domain of the OV. A large increase of NeuroD expression occurred in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 embryos. In these embryos, an ectopic ganglion formed in the posterior domain of the OV, at the same stages ( Fig. 4 A,B). Further, the anterior and posterior ectopic CVG became fused, along with cranial ganglia VII and IX ( Fig. 4 A,B). This phenotype has previously been described ( Raft et al., 2004 ; Xu et al., 2007 ) and is shown for the sake of comparison. When one or both copies of Jag1 were inactivated on a Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 background, NeuroD expression expanded to an even greater degree than in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 embryos at both E10 and E10.5 ( Fig. 4 A,B). Histological analysis was performed of whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments on both E10 and E10.5 embryos, though only sections at E10.5 are shown ( Fig. 4 B). The histological sections further illustrated the expansion of the NeuroD domain, as well as expansion of distal IXth and Xth ganglia, and fusion of these three ganglia with the Vth ganglion, in the case of the double homozygous mutant embryos ( Fig. 4 B, yellow arrow). Further, the area of NeuroD expression was quantified in tissue sections for both E10 and E10.5 mutant embryos ( Fig. S6A ). Indeed, we found that the area of expression was significantly greater in double mutant embryos in than in Tbx1 single mutant embryos at both stages. This expansion appeared to be dose-dependent, as decreasing dosage of Tbx1 and Jag1 correlated with increasing expression levels of NeuroD . Download powerpoint Fig. 4. Inactivation of Tbx1 and Jag1 with Tbx1 Cre results in expanded proneural gene expression. (A,B) Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed on genotypes shown, using an antisense probe for NeuroD at E10 (A) and E10.5 (B). There is a synergistic increase in expression in the CVG (cranial ganglion VIII) as Tbx1 and Jag1 dosage decreases. There is a similar increase in expression in the other cranial ganglia as well (VII, IX, X), shown in both whole mounts and sections. Fusion of all the ganglia with the Vth ganglion occurs in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/flox mutants, indicated by the yellow arrow. Adjacent is a schematic depicting the phenotype observed in Tbx1 single and Tbx1;Jag1 double mutants. (C) Immunofluorescence on transverse sections with a NeuroD antibody. Both the CVG and OV epithelium are outlined with a white dashed line. The mean total numbers of NeuroD + cells in the OV epithelium alone (D) and the OV epithelium in combination with the CVG (E) were significantly greater in double mutant OVs as compared to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 OVs. Note: three embryos and six OVs per genotype were used for each group. Embryos were stage-matched at 27ss. Data are mean\u00b1s.e.m. ** P <0.005; *** P <0.001. Because whole-mount in situ hybridization is somewhat limited in the resolution of expression it provides, we also performed immunofluorescence studies on tissue sections using an antibody to NeuroD on double conditional null mutant embryos ( Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ and Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/flox ) and Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 embryos ( Fig. 4 C). We used this to quantify the number of NeuroD positive (NeuroD + ) cells within the OV epithelium alone, as well as the total number of NeuroD + cells within the epithelium, plus cells that have delaminated to form the CVG ( Fig. 4 D,E) at E9.5. Because the epibranchial ganglia appear to fuse with the CVG in these mutants, it is important that we quantify cells within the OV epithelium alone, in order to isolate the otic epithelial-specific function of Jag1 and Tbx1 from potential function in other cranial placodes or ganglia. More distal ganglia can be easily distinguished as discrete patches of cells in many of the transverse sections; therefore, we are confident that a majority of the cells present in the VIIIth ganglion/CVG region are composed of otic epithelial cells. However, a fraction of those ventral-most cells may likely originate from the epibranchial ganglia, and so, two distinct quantifications are needed. The mean total number of NeuroD + cells from both analyses were significantly greater in double mutant OVs as compared to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 OVs ( Fig. 4 D). We additionally quantified neuroblast numbers in the CVG in double conditional null mutant embryos ( Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/flox ) and Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 embryos using an antibody to Isl1 on serial sections at E10.5 ( Fig. S6B ). Similarly, we found that the mean total number of Isl1 + cells from both analyses were significantly greater in double mutants as compared to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 mutants ( Fig. S6B ). Interestingly, we noticed from both NeuroD and Isl1 immunofluorescence experiments that neuroblasts preferentially expanded into the lateral domain of the CVG in double mutants ( Fig. 4 C; Fig. S6B ). One explanation for the expansion of the NSD region in Tbx1;Jag1 double conditional null mutant embryos, is that there is an increase in cell proliferation of neural progenitor cells. To address this, we performed immunofluorescence on tissue sections at E9.5 using antibodies to phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3) to mark proliferating cells, and NeuroD to mark the neuroblasts ( Fig. 5 D). We calculated the mitotic index of proliferating neuroblasts from the OV by dividing the total number of proliferating cells (pHH3 + ) that colocalized with NeuroD by the total number of NeuroD + cells, and these numbers were averaged per OV. We found that the mitotic indices were not higher, but in fact they were lower in both Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ and Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 floxflox embryos compared to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 embryos ( Fig. 5 A,B). These differences were statistically significant: P <0.05 for both. We also compared the average number of pHH3 + cells that colocalized with NeuroD per ear and found consistent results ( Fig. 5 B). Thus, proliferation alone cannot account for the changes in neural precursor expression observed. We also noted that the OV was noticeably smaller in Tbx1;Jag1 double conditional null mutant embryos compared to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 embryos, and wondered if this could be due to a reduction in the number of non-neural proliferating cells. Indeed, we found that there was a significant reduction ( P <0.05 for both double mutants) in the average number of proliferating cells that were negative for NeuroD expression within the OV at E9.5 ( Fig. 5 C). One possibility is that the smaller OV arises due to a change in cell fate from non-neural to neural and, subsequently, cells delaminated from the OV to form the CVG. These findings were somewhat surprising since inactivation of Jag1 is associated with a decrease in CVG size ( Fig. 3 ) ( Pan et al., 2010 ). Nonetheless, our findings show that the expansion of the neurogenic region observed in Tbx1 ; Jag1 double mutant embryos is not merely additive, nor synthetic, but rather it is due to a synergistic expansion of neuroblasts when both genes are lost at the NSD border. Taken together, these findings suggest that Tbx1 and Jag1 genetically interact at the NSD border to regulate neurosensory patterning across the medial-lateral axis of the OV, and that loss of both genes brings about an overproduction of neuroblasts contributing to the CVG that is not caused by increased cell proliferation. Download powerpoint Fig. 5. An increased number of NeuroD + cells is unaccompanied by changes in neuroblast proliferation in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ and Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/flox mutants at E9.5. (A) Bar graphs plotting the mean mitotic index per ear within the neuroblast population as defined by NeuroD expression. Mitotic index was calculated by dividing the total number of proliferating cells (pHH3 + ) that colocalized with NeuroD by the total number of NeuroD + cells. Values were markedly lower in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ and Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/flox OVs and the differences reached statistical significance. (B) Bar graphs plotting the mean total number of pHH3 + cells in the OV within NeuroD + domain per OV. Values were statistically significantly lower in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ and Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/flox OVs compared to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 OVs. (C) Bar graphs plotting the mean total number of pHH3 + cells in the OV outside the NeuroD + domain per OV. Values were statistically significantly lower in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ and Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/flox OVs compared to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 OVs. (D) Examples of the dual immunofluorescence experiment using antibodies to NeuroD and pHH3, used to calculate the above data. There are visibly fewer proliferating cells throughout the OV of Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ embryos compared to Tbx1 Cre/ embryos. The VIIIth ganglion/CVG is markedly larger in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ mutants compared to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 mutants. A distinct portion of the fused distal epibranchial ganglia (IX/X) is also outlined below. Note: three embryos and six OVs per genotype were used for each group. Embryos were stage-matched at 27ss. Data are mean\u00b1s.e.m. * P <0.05; ** P <0.005. Later embryonic defects in the inner ear in Tbx1 and/or Jag1 mutant embryos Paintfilling and histological analysis of embryos was performed to examine the morphology of the inner ear during later embryonic stages ( Fig. 6 ; Fig. S7 ). We first compared Tbx1 Cre ;Jag1 flox/flox and Tbx1 Cre ;Jag1 flox/\u2212 embryos at E15.5 to littermate controls. We found that Tbx1 Cre ;Jag1 flox/flox mutant embryos had similar inner malformations as observed when Jag1 was conditionally inactivated using the Foxg1 Cre allele ( Kiernan et al., 2006 ). The Foxg1 Cre allele is frequently used to inactivate genes throughout the otic epithelium ( H\u00e9bert and McConnell, 2000 ), presumably resulting in a broader inactivation of Jag1 than would a Tbx1 Cre -mediated inactivation. The major phenotype observed was incomplete formation of the SCCs and ampullae, as well as a slightly smaller saccule ( Fig. 6 ). Closer observation with histological analysis on E15.5 and adult inner ears ( Fig. 6 B, a-d\u2032; Fig. S7 ), revealed that in Tbx1 Cre ;Jag1 flox/flox or Tbx1 Cre ;Jag1 flox/\u2212 mutants, all three cristae were missing and the saccule was shortened. The rest of the sensory structures developed normally. Hair cells in the sensory structures that formed appeared histologically normal ( Fig. 6 B, a-d\u2032; Fig. S7 ). Previously published Foxg1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/flox mutant embryos ( Kiernan et al., 2006 ) shared the cristae and SCC phenotype; however, they also had abnormal cochleae, utricles and associated hair and support cells. The saccules were slightly smaller as in the Tbx1 Cre -mediated mutant embryos, and hair cells were present. Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/\u2212 mutants did not exhibit obvious abnormalities in the cochlea or utricles; however, we did not quantify hair or support cell numbers, which may be required in order to reveal subtle differences. We also examined the spiral/cochlear ganglia and vestibular ganglia, and noticed that while there was no significant difference in size in the spiral ganglia between mutants, the vestibular ganglia were much smaller in Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/\u2212 mutants compared to Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/+ mutants. Since all three cristae are not present in Tbx1 Cre ;Jag1 flox/\u2212 mutants, it is likely that lack of hair cell innervation caused the vestibular ganglion to be either underdeveloped or partially degenerate ( Fig. 6 B, c,c\u2032).

(A) Paintfilling of E15.5, Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/+ , Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/flox , Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 , Tbx1 Cre/ \u2212 ; Jag1 flox/+ and wild-type control inner ears. Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag flox/+ ears are relatively normal but present with narrowing of the canals, particularly the anterior canal (white asterisk). Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag flox/flox ears display incomplete development of the anterior semicircular canal (ac), posterior semicircular canal (pc) and lateral semicircular canal (lc), as well as their associated ampullae, respectively (aa, pa, la) (white asterisks). Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 mutant ears have an enlarged endolymphatic duct (ed) (white tracing), while the rest of the inner ear does not fully develop and remains a vesicle with a posterior protrusion. Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag flox/+ mutant ears are similar to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ears but the vesicle is smaller and the protrusion is extended ventrally. (B) Transverse histological sections stained by H&E. All three cristae develop normally in Tbx1 Cre/+ ; Jag1 flox/+ embryos (a,b). The anterior crista (ac) and lateral crista (lc) attached to the utricle (u) are shown. An image of b at a higher magnification in the inset shows rows of hair cells (hc) and support cells (sc) that develop normally. All three cristae are missing from Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/flox ears (a\u2032,b\u2032). Vestibular (vg) and spiral ganglia (sg) appear to form normally in Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/+ embryos (c,d). The vg is noticeably smaller in Tbx1 Cre/+ ; Jag1 flox/flox embryos while the sg appears to develop normally (c\u2032,d\u2032). The inner ear rudiment (the vesicle ventral of the endolymphatic duct) in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 mutants overall are mostly lacking in hair cells, particularly in lateral regions (red arrowhead); however, the medial ventral wall of the vesicle is fairly densely populated with hair cells (black arrowhead) (e). An image of e at a higher magnification is shown in f. Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ ears are similar to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ears in that they are mostly lacking hair cells, particularly in lateral regions (red arrowhead) (e\u2032). Medial regions are populated by some hair cells, but much more sparsely. An image of e\u2032 at a higher magnification is shown in f\u2032. Next, we examined Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ embryos compared with Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 embryos at E15.5 in the same manner. Paintfilling of Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 mutant embryos revealed the endolymphatic duct is greatly enlarged while the rest of the inner ear has been reduced to a vesicle with a small posterior protrusion on the medial side of the ear ( Fig. 6 A). This is a very similar, though slightly less severe phenotype, to that which has been published ( Freyer et al., 2013 ). Paintfilling of Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ inner ears revealed a similar phenotype to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 mutants, with an enlarged endolymphatic duct while none of the other structures form ( Fig. 6 A). The remaining cystic OV in compound mutants was smaller and different in shape compared to Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 inner ears. There is also a protrusion from the OV, but it extended ventrally as opposed to posteriorly ( n =6). Histological analysis of these ears was more telling. Interestingly, although Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ears were severely malformed, the ventral medial portion of the vesicle contained a row of hair cells ( Fig. 6 B, e,f, black arrowheads). Most of the OV was unpopulated with hair cells outside of this domain ( Fig. 6 B, e,f, red arrowheads). The Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ OV contained much fewer hair cells in the same domain ( Fig. 6 B, e\u2032,f\u2032). Serial sections of mutant embryos confirmed this throughout most of the abnormal OV. In addition, the cochlear and vestibular ganglia were absent in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 and Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 flox/+ mutant embryos. Because there are so few hair cells in both mutant embryos, this is again, likely to be due to lack of innervation and, consequently, underdevelopment and/or degeneration of the ganglia and neurons within. DISCUSSION Tbx1 modulates neurosensory cell fate in a domain-specific manner In this study, we found that loss of one allele of Jag1 in the Tbx1 expression domain exacerbated the expanded neurogenesis phenotype of Tbx1 loss-of-function embryos. This co-occurred with increased proneural gene expression in the OV, unaccompanied by changes in cell proliferation. Based upon all this, we created a model that summarizes our findings, shown in Fig. 7 . Despite the fact that loss of Jag1 alone resulted in a smaller CVG than in wild-type embryos, when one or both alleles of Jag1 was inactivated with Tbx1 , more neuroblasts were present than in global Tbx1 null mutant embryos ( Fig. 7 ). This revealed that Jag1 plays a complex role in neural development that is unmasked when inactivated within the Tbx1 expression domain together with Tbx1 , and that Tbx1 and Jag1 may genetically interact in this process. Download powerpoint Fig. 7. Model summary. A schematic of the OV summarizing the expression of the key genes of this study in the OV that is oriented as shown (dorsal-ventral, D-V; medial-lateral, M-L; anterior-posterior, A-P). In wild-type embryos at E10-10.5, Tbx1 is expressed at the NSD border marked by overlapping expression of neurogenic genes (grey stripes) and Jag1/Sox2 (red) in the anteroventral OV. This NSD is positioned adjacent to the developing CVG, marked by NeuroD and Isl1 expression (grey), and contributes to it some of its progenitor cells fated to become neurons. When Tbx1 is homozygously inactivated (Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ), Jag1 expression is expanded throughout the OV, disrupting the NSD border. The CVG also expands into the posterior and lateral domain in Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 (or Tbx1 \u2212/\u2212 ) OVs. When Jag1 is inactivated ( Jag1 \u2212/\u2212 ), the Tbx1 expression domain is unchanged, and the CVG is significantly smaller in size. When Jag1 is inactivated together with Tbx1 in the Tbx1 expression domain ( Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 f/+ or Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 f/f \u2013 termed Tbx1 Cre/\u2212 ;Jag1 CKO ), the NSD border is disrupted and the CVG is further enlarged. In this work, we found that inactivation of Tbx1 and Jag1 within the Tbx1 expression domain particularly affected the M-L boundary, in addition to the already disrupted A-P boundary seen in Tbx1 \u2212/\u2212 OVs ( Fig. 4 ) ( Raft et al., 2004 ). Relevant to these findings, Sapede et al. (2012) performed cell lineage analysis in zebrafish that identified a population of common progenitors that can give rise to neurons and hair cells that reside in the posteromedial part of the OV. In this study, we found Jag1 and Sox2 , required for sensorigenesis and neurogenesis, to be expressed in the posteromedial region of the OV, forming a border with lateral-expressed Tbx1 at the NSD border. One interpretation of these data is that regulation of the M-L boundary is important for the maintenance of this domain and Jag1 , along with Sox2 , serves as marker of this common pool of cells, the fate of which is restricted by Tbx1 . Tbx1 fate mapping in Tbx1 null mutant embryos also provided evidence suggesting that Tbx1 may regulate CVG formation in a cell-nonautonomous (as well as cell-autonomous) manner. Based upon these findings, we further speculate that there might be an intermediate gene or genes between Tbx1 and master proneural transcription factors NeuroD and Ngn1 , one of which may be Jag1 . The role of Jag1 in NSD development Our data suggest that Tbx1 restricts neurosensory cell formation by acting at the NSD border of the OV either directly or indirectly, restricting Jag1 and Sox2 expression. Previous findings in chick show that overexpression of human JAG1 in the OV induces expression of Sox2 in a Notch-dependent manner ( Neves et al., 2011 ), but that this only occurs for specification of the sensory patches. This study concluded that Sox2 establishes early neurosensory competence , which is independent of Jag1 ( Neves et al., 2011 ). While this is the situation in chick, we speculate that in mouse, Jag1 plays a role in the specification or maintenance of the fate of cell subtypes within the NSD and not just the sensory patches. Mouse studies showed that Jag1 is required for the specification of sensory precursors and a subset of neural precursors ( Pan et al., 2010 ). This supports the hypothesis that Jag1 plays a role in NSD ( Pan et al., 2010 ). Our findings with respect to Tbx1 also support a new possible role of Jag1 in the NSD. Furthermore, our studies show that Jag1 expression may be broader in the mouse OV than in chick and more closely resemble Sox2 expression ( Neves et al., 2011 ). If the expression of Jag1 in mouse more closely follows that of Sox2 , this could indicate that, like Sox2 , it plays a role in the development of the NSD. Finally, studies in mouse also suggest that the clonal population of progenitors that can give rise to neurons and hair cells may consist of a larger pool of cells than in chick ( Fritzsch et al., 2006 ). If this is the case, regulation of this cell population may necessitate a larger network of genes, such as Tbx1 . While these are all plausible hypotheses, it is also possible that the differences we see in mouse and chick are due to differences in experimental strategy. Since Jag1 was overexpressed in chick studies and inactivated in mouse studies, it is possible that Jag1 is required, but not sufficient, for the development of the NSD. Tbx1 and Jag1 may be required to maintain a balance of cell types within the NSD Loss of Tbx1 may affect neurosensory precursor cell fate via Jag1 , as evidenced by the further expansion of proneural gene expression when Jag1 is concomitantly inactivated. Since sensory structures do not develop in Tbx1 \u2212/\u2212 embryos, but the CVG is duplicated ( Arnold et al., 2006 ; Raft et al., 2004 ; Vitelli et al., 2003 ), we surmise that the expansion of the area of expression of NSD genes indicates a switch in cell fate from sensory to neural. Additional inactivation of Jag1 may enhance this switch, based on our findings of a synergistic expansion in proneural gene expression in the OV, as well as failure of cristae and some hair cells to form properly at later stages, in Tbx1;Jag1 compound mutants. We cannot exclude the possibility that nonsensory cells may also change their fate to form neuroblasts, as the semicircular canals and ampullae also do not fully form in Tbx1 Cre/+ ;Jag1 flox/flox mutant inner ears. Expansion in the neuroblast population observed in the compound mutant embryos appears contradictory to the perceived role of Jag1 in neurosensory development; however, Notch1 is known to have contrasting roles during neurogenesis and sensorigenesis ( Adam et al., 1998 ; Daudet et al., 2007 ; Pan et al., 2010 ; Petrovic et al., 2014 ), making the interpretation of such experiments complex. One potential explanation for our findings is that Jag1 may define which cells within the NSD become sensory or neural by repressing neural fate within the boundary cells where it is co-expressed with Tbx1 . Outside this domain and perhaps earlier in development, Jag1 may play a role in neurosensory competence together with Sox2. This may explain why both the CVG and sensory organs are hypoplastic when Jag1 is globally inactivated ( Pan et al., 2010 ). Thus, we suggest that Tbx1 and Jag1 function in opposing pathways during NSD development, but we speculate that they can also repress neural differentiation within the otic epithelium by acting similarly on common downstream factors. One of the main strengths of this study is that we had optimal Cre alleles to inactivate Tbx1 and Jag1 in the same expression domains. This allowed us to discover an interaction between the two genes in neurosensory patterning in which loss of Jag1 enhances the effect of loss of Tbx1 in restricting neurogenesis. We performed in situ hybridization of many molecular markers but could not observe a difference in the pattern of expression between the Tbx1 loss-of-function mutant and the double Tbx1;Jag1 loss-of-function mutant embryos. This is one of the limitations in the study, and we believe this is due to the choice of genes evaluated or lack of resolution of in situ hybridization methods we used. To determine the mechanism for the Tbx1;Jag1 interaction and to gain further insights into cell fate changes in the NSD, we suggest that unbiased genome wide expression profiling approaches are required. This could be coupled with single cell RNA-sequencing of NSD cells in wild-type and mutant OVs in order to fully elucidate the molecular mechanism. Conclusions In conclusion, Tbx1 and Jag1 act in discrete regions of the OV to limit the size of the CVG in mouse embryos. Inactivating Jag1 with Tbx1 Cre reveals a novel role for Jag1 , whereby in this context Jag1 acts to repress neural fate, in contrast to its known function. We suggest that normal Tbx1 and Jag1 dosage may be required to maintain a proper balance of cell types within the NSD of the OV to form the inner ear. This knowledge could have important implications for future stem cell therapies designed to treat sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice Mice used in this study comply with the regulatory standards of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, #20160507) of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. All mouse models have been previously described. The CMV-GFP reporter mice were obtained from Dr. Gordon Fishell at New York University Langone Medical Center (Batista-Brito et al., 2009). Pax2-Cre mice were provided by Dr. Andrew K. Groves ( Ohyama and Groves, 2004 ). Tbx1 Cre/+ mice were provided by Dr. Antonio Baldini ( Huynh et al., 2007 ). Tbx1 - GFP mice, termed \u2018 Tbx1 GOF \u2019, were engineered in our laboratory, in which a Tbx1-GFP fusion protein was added downstream of a loxP-STOP-loxP site in the Rosa26 locus and used as previously described ( Freyer et al., 2013 ). Tbx1 +/\u2212 and Tbx1 flox mice ( Arnold et al., 2006 ) were engineered in our laboratory and used as previously described. Jag1 null (stock number 010616), Jag1 flox ( stock number 010618) and Pax3 Cre/+ (stock number 005549) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Embryos were dissected according to date of vaginal plug (E0.5). Embryonic stages <E11.5 were confirmed by counting pairs of somites. Animals were maintained in a 12\u2005h dark/12\u2005h light cycle in compliance with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and IACUC. Mice were genotyped for Cre alleles using the following primers: (5\u2032-CAATGCTGTTTCACTGGTTATG-3\u2032) and (5\u2032-CATTGCCCCTGTTTCACTATC-3\u2032). The Tbx1 flox allele was detected using primers that have been previously described ( Braunstein et al., 2009 ). CMV-GFP reporter and Tbx1-GFP mice were genotyped for the GFP allele using the following primers: GFP-Fwd (5\u2032-TAAACGGCCACAAGTTCAGC-3\u2032) and GFP-Rev (5\u2032-GAACTCCAGCAGGACCATG-3\u2032), while the wild-type allele was detected using the following primers: RO1F (5\u2032-GCAATACCTTTCTGGGAGTT-3\u2032) and GFP-wt-R (5\u2032-CAATGCTCTGTCTAGGGGTT-3\u2032). The interval within the Jag1 flox allele was amplified as described by Jackson Laboratories using the following primers: 10092 Jag1 Forward (5\u2032-TCAGGCATGATAAACCCTAGC-3\u2032) and 10093 Jag1 Reverse (5\u2032-CTACATACAGCATCTACATGC-3\u2032). Jag1 null mice were also genotyped as described by Jackson Laboratories using the following primers: 10089 Forward (5\u2032-TCTCACTCAGGCATGATAAACC-3\u2032), 10090 Wild-type Reverse (5\u2032 TAACGGGGACTCCGGACAGGG-3\u2032), and oIMR8162 Mutant Reverse (5\u2032- TGGATGTGGAATGTGTGCGAG-3\u2032). Immunofluorescence on tissue sections Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C. Fixation times varied according to embedding method: 2\u2005h for frozen embryos and overnight for paraffin-embedded embryos. Frozen embryos were washed in 0.1\u2005M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and embedded in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight. Embryos were embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek) on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Transverse cryosections were generated at 10\u2005\u03bcm in thickness. Tissue sections were washed in PBS and permeabilized in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 for 5\u2005min. They were then washed in PBS followed by PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked in 5% goat or donkey serum (G9023 and D9663, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 1\u2005h at room temperature (RT) followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in block for 1\u2005h at RT. Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit polyclonal \u03b1-Tbx1 (1:500; Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA), goat polyclonal \u03b1-Jag1 (1:100; C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal \u03b1-Sox2 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal \u03b1-NeuroD (1:500; sc-1084, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal \u03b1-GFP (1:500; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal \u03b1-GFP (1:500; ab290, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal \u03b1-phospho-histone H3 (1:500; Ser 10, 06-570, Emd Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and mouse monoclonal \u03b1-Tuj1 (1:1000; MMS-435P, Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA). Tissue sections were then washed three times in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in block together with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidine-2-phenylidole-dihydrochloride; 1:500) for 1\u2005h at RT. Secondary antibodies were as follows: Alexa Fluor 568 goat \u03b1-rabbit IgG (A-11011, Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 568 goat \u03b1-mouse IgG (A-11004, Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 488 goat \u03b1-rabbit IgG (A-11008, Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey \u03b1-goat (A-11055, Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 568 donkey \u03b1-goat IgG (A-11057, Invitrogen). All secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:500. Sections were washed three times in PBS/0.1% TritonX-100 followed by brief washes in PBS and then water. For dual color immunofluorescence, primary antibodies were incubated on tissue sections at the same time, and secondary antibodies were subsequently incubated on sections at the same time. Slides were mounted in Vectashield hard-set mounting medium (H-1400, Vector Laboratories) and stored at 4\u00b0C. Images were captured using an Axio Observer (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C overnight. They were then dehydrated in a series of methanol/PBS/0.1% Tween-20 dilutions to 100% methanol and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Upon rehydration to 0.1%PBS/0.1% Tween-20, in situ hybridization was carried out as previously described ( Franco et al., 2001 ). Antisense digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes to Tbx1 ( Funke et al., 2001 ), NeuroD ( Lee et al., 1995 ), and Jag1 ( Jayasena et al., 2008 ) were used as described. The Hes6 RNA probe template was generated from amplified E9.5 mouse cDNA using the following primers: 5\u2032-GGGGAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAACGAGAGT CTTCAGGAGCT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGGGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTACAAACGA GGAGCAGCTTC-3\u2032. Quantitative analyses Cell counting and area measurements were performed using ImageJ software. Mitotic index was calculated by dividing the total number of pHH3 + cells that colocalized with NeuroD, divided by the total number of NeuroD + cells (within the OV and CVG). OV area was calculated by subtracting the area of the inner OV by the area of the outer OV. Investigators were blinded to group allocation during all analyses. For all analyses, n \u22656 ears (from at least three different animals) per group. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. Groups were compared using a two-tailed, Independent Samples (unequal variance) t- test. Data met the assumption of the test (i.e. data within groups fell under a normal distribution). 3D reconstruction Serial sections of the otic vesicle were aligned using AutoAligner software (Bitplane AG) and regions of interest were traced and reconstructed using BioVis3D software. Histology Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C. They were then dehydrated to 70% ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sectioning was performed at 10-12\u2005\u03bcm thicknesses. Tissues were cleared in xylene, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and then mounted in Permount. Paintfilling Embryos were cut below the forelimbs and fixed in 5% glacial acetic acid, 2% formaldehyde and 75% ethanol overnight. This was followed by dehydration to ethanol and clearing in methyl salicylate. Embryos were bisected dorsally and the brain was removed. A micropipette was used to microinject 0.2% correction fluid diluted in methyl salicylate into the utricle. Paintfilled inner ears were imaged and stored in methyl salicylate.

The BA m. Semitendinosus has a faster muscle fibre isoform phenotype comprising a higher proportion of fast type IIX fibres compared to age-matched Charolais (CH). To better understand the molecular network of modifications in BA compared to CH muscle, we assayed the transcriptomes of the m. Semitendinosus at 110, 180, 210 and 260\u2005days postconception (dpc). We used a combination of differential expression (DE) and regulatory impact factors (RIF) to compare and contrast muscle gene expression between the breeds. Prominently developmentally regulated genes in both breeds reflected the replacement of embryonic myosin isoforms ( MYL4 , MYH3 ) with adult isoforms ( MYH1 ) and the upregulation of mitochondrial metabolism ( CKMT2 , AGXT2L1 ) in preparation for birth. However, the transition to a fast, glycolytic muscle phenotype in the MSTN mutant BA is detectable through downregulation of various slow twitch subunits ( TNNC1 , MYH7 , TPM3 , CSRP3 ) beyond 210 dpc, and a small but consistent genome-wide reduction in mRNA encoding the mitoproteome. Across the breeds, NRIP2 is the regulatory gene possessing a network change most similar to that of MSTN . BACKGROUND Feed is the single largest cost in many intensive livestock farming enterprises including beef feedlotting ( Robinson and Oddy, 2004 ). Consequently, the food production industry is interested in enhancing the feed conversion efficiency of its major production species. Accelerating improvements in these areas beyond what can be achieved by traditional artificial selection on phenotype first requires a base level of understanding. What physiological and developmental processes are taking place, and what are their functional limits? Fortunately, domesticated species provide opportunity to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning phenotypes of interest ( Andersson and Georges, 2004 ). Agricultural scientists have numerous breeds at their disposal that, through generations of selective breeding, possess strong phenotypes expressed against a relatively stable background genome. The mechanistic basis of feed efficiency is not known, but variation in feed intake, digestion, metabolism, activity and thermogenesis have all been implicated ( Herd and Arthur, 2009 ). Focussing on skeletal muscle tissue, mammals possess a range of fibre types with different functional properties. Interestingly, we already know that highly feed-efficient breeds of all the major production species, such as Piedmontese cattle ( Lehnert et al., 2007 ), Belgian Blue cattle ( Bouley et al., 2005 ; Deveaux et al., 2001 ; Hanset et al., 1987 ), Large White pigs ( Lefaucheur and Ecolan, 2005 ; Lefaucheur et al., 2004 , 2011 ), German Landrace pigs ( Rehfeldt et al., 2008 ) and Callipyge sheep ( Jackson et al., 1997a , b , c ), collectively possess exactly the same shift towards a whiter type IIB/IIX phenotype compared to their wild counterparts and less efficient breeds. Broiler chicken muscle can be seen as the most extreme example of this phenotype ( Kiessling, 1977 ). A bioenergetic feature of type IIB/X fibres is a lower mitochondrial content than type I and IIA. This implies that the glycolytic fibre shift documented above will result in muscle tissue mitochondrial content decreasing. Direct measures of mitochondrial content have not been routinely taken. However, Vincent et al. (2015) recently discovered that when divergently selecting on residual feed intake, the more efficient pigs possessed a lower muscle oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial content. Similarly, in Yorkshire boars, low muscle mitochondrial content has recently been associated with higher feed efficiency ( Fu et al., 2017 ). In addition, double-muscled cattle or cattle selected for high growth potential and feed efficiency also possess less oxidative muscles ( Sudre et al., 2005 ; Picard et al., 2006 ), as do Charolais (CH) divergent for muscle mass ( Sudre et al., 2005 ). A reduction in oxidative capacity has previously been argued to improve metabolic efficiency on the grounds that it is inefficient to possess too much fuel burning capacity ( Hudson, 2009 ). The engineering argument runs as follows: it is not economical to pay for the construction (biogenesis), maintenance (trans-membrane proton gradient) and load (space that could be occupied by other cellular structures) of energetically expensive mitochondrial capacity that is not needed. Further, Bottje and Carstens (2009) have reviewed the impact of isolated mitochondrial performance and its impact on poultry and livestock feed, efficiency documenting associations in several species and circumstances. These lines of evidence support a role for mitochondrial function in contributing to variation in feed efficiency. However, the genetic bases of the \u2018whitening\u2019 of livestock muscle and other biological aspects of efficiency remain a mystery. Other than some progress in identifying causal mutations such as the various myostatin ( MSTN) mutants, the detailed rewiring of gene regulatory networks that manifest these anatomical and physiological changes through muscle development are largely unknown. Here, we attempt to shed more light on this question by contrasting the genome-wide muscle transcriptomes of two breeds of cattle. A MSTN mutation has been identified in the Blonde d'Aquitaine (BA) breed ( Bouyer et al., 2014 ) that culminates in greater muscle mass and feed efficiency than the comparison CH, but not all individuals carry the mutation. In line with the other examples given above, BA also has a more glycolytic, less oxidative muscle metabolism and a higher proportion of fast glycolytic IIX fibres ( Listrat et al., 2001 ; Picard and Cassar-Malek, 2009 ). We analysed m. Semitendinosus samples at three prenatal time points coincident with secondary myogenesis (110\u2005days postconception (dpc), onset of functional differentiation (180\u2005dpc), completion of functional differentiation (210\u2005dpc), in addition to a later time point prior to birth when mature muscle has been established (260\u2005dpc). Through the application of several methods including a differential network algorithm we have identified molecules behaving differently between the two breeds during pre-natal development, when adult muscle potential is defined. RESULTS Histology Representative histology sections of the m. Semitendinosus for the two breeds of cattle were analysed at each time point (data not shown). By 260\u2005dpc, comparison of fibre frequencies in the muscle of BA versus CH at 260\u2005dpc ( Fig. S1 ) showed that BA muscle contained a lower proportion of slow (I) fibres than CH (8.2% versus 15.8%), of which 77% still expressed the foetal myosin heavy chain (MyHC). Moreover, BA muscle contained a higher proportion of fast (II) fibres than CH (92.8% versus 76.4%), of which 47% still expressed the foetal MyHC. Lastly, the proportion of IICF fibres (transition fibres containing I, IIa and F MyHC) was lower in the muscle of BA versus CH. This clearly indicated a predominant fast glycolytic phenotype in the BA. Accordingly, at 260\u2005dpc, the activity of oxidative enzymes was lower in the BA than in the CH. The higher content of foetal MyHC also suggested that the differentiation of BA fibres originating from both the first and secondary generation was delayed compared to that of CH fibres. Developmental patterns of differential expression (DE) in both breeds We determined normalized mean expression values for 45,220 probes mapped to 17,646 bovine protein coding genes. After quality checking for a minimal level of expression in seven of the eight treatments, we were left with a refined list containing 19,100 probes mapping to 10,138 genes. When comparing the breeds for patterns of high developmental regulation (including but not limited to stepwise increases and decreases across development), a number of genes were identified. This was achieved by computing the standard deviation of expression values across the four time points on a breed-specific basis. High standard deviations reflect high developmental regulation. The replacement of embryonic myosin heavy chain isoforms ( MYL4 , MYH3 ) with adult isoforms ( MYH1 ) was observed. Further, we detected an upregulation of creatine kinase ( CKMT2 ), a marker of mitochondrial metabolism, in preparation for birth ( Table 1 ). We also detected strong developmental regulation of an unannotated Open Reading Frame (ORF), C13H20ORF194 . AGXT2L1 also has high developmental regulation, but missing values at some developmental stages in both breeds meant it could not be reported in Table 1 . It can be seen that the gene expression pattern change in these genes is dominated by upregulation as development progresses. However, we wish to emphasize that this is not a result forced by the analysis. Further exploration of the data finds that SNAP91 ranked in 11th position has a pattern of decline in gene expression over development. This gene encodes a protein enriched in nervous tissue so its expression pattern in muscle samples presumably reflects some aspect of the neuromuscular junction and associated motor innervation. View this table: Table 1. Top 10 highly developmentally regulated genes in both breeds A subset of these genes has also been highlighted in the MA plots represented in Fig. 1 . In these plots, in line with all our analysis, the DE is computed by BA minus CH. Patterns of developmental expression change (as opposed to breed DE) can be monitored by following the change in position on the x axis (average abundance) of the plots as one proceeds through development, 110\u2005days to 260\u2005days. Download powerpoint Fig. 1. MA plots at all four time points, highlighting a subset of developmentally regulated and breed-affected genes. These include muscle structural isoforms, mitochondrial metabolism and the causal mutation MSTN . The slow myosin isoforms being downregulated in the BA is consistent with a shift to a faster muscle phenotype in the mutant BA by 260\u2005days. The strong developmental regulation in both breeds of C13H20ORF194 and MYH1 is also apparent. MSTN is consistently upregulated in the more muscular BA. We only included data from those genes >0.5 log DE in an effort to simplify the plots. The 0.5 threshold is an entirely arbitrary decision and is not meant to represent significance. Breed contrast using DE As part of our strategy to detect patterns of DE between the breeds at each time point individually we plotted the MA plots as four separate panels ( Fig. 1 ). We only plotted those data minimally differentially expressed (>0.5 log2 DE) to simplify presentation. This 0.5 log2 DE is an arbitrary decision and is not meant to reflect a judgment of statistical significance. In all the plots we have highlighted functional groups of genes we have previously found to be tightly co-expressed in bovine muscle and where the encoded proteins have fundamental roles in embryonic muscle development ( MYL4 and MYH3 ), adult muscle fibre composition ( TNNC1 , MYH7 and MYL2 ), mitochondrial metabolism ( CKMT2 and AGXT2L1 ) and triacylglyceride synthesis ( FABP4 , PLIN1 and DGAT2 ). The coordination in expression of these independently measured genes lends more credibility to the biological implications. Further, we also annotated on each plot an adult muscle myosin ( MYH1 ) and an ORF ( C13H20ORF194 ) with strong developmental regulation. The latter was previously identified in an independent bovine muscle data set. Finally, we further annotated genes with extreme DE values in at least one of the plots. This includes XIST , a non-coding RNA involved in X chromosome silencing. In order to get a broader perspective on DE between the breeds, we established which genes showed cumulatively the most DE between breeds across all time points combined. We summed the absolute mean log2 DE at each of the four developmental stages and ranked the output (see Table S1 for the full data; Table 2 contains the extreme 20). The entire ranked list (10,138 unique genes) was imported into GOrilla ( Eden et al., 2009 ) for functional enrichment analysis assessed by hypergeometric statistics. Gorilla used 49% of the genes in the analysis based on those gene names it recognized and for which it had accompanying functional information. GOrilla found \u2018type I interferon signalling pathway\u2019 to be highly enriched based on genes present near the top of the list (FDR Q value<1.25 e \u221211 ) in the \u2018Process\u2019 ontology . This enrichment was derived from the following high ranking genes: XAF1 , IFITM1 , RSAD2 , ISG15 , USP18 , MX1 , IFI27 , PSMB8 , OAS2 and IFI6 . View this table: Download powerpoint Table 2. Top 20 most differentially expressed genes summed across all four developmental time points when contrasting the two breeds Overall, MSTN was the third most differentially expressed gene using this approach. MSTN was expressed at relatively higher levels in the BA animals at all time points. The breed difference in expression level of the MSTN downstream canonical signalling pathway could not be determined because the MSTN receptor ACTVIIB and major downstream signalling molecule SMAD7 did not pass the quality checking criteria in at least one of the time points . The interferon signalling molecules are prominent among the differentially expressed genes. It is possible that the patterns of DE across development are quite different in these extreme performers identified by this metric. For example, using this approach, one very divergent time point could give the same ranking as more modest differences at each time point. Consequently, all extreme values need assessment on a case by case basis to better infer the biological implications. The highlighting of the extreme 20 in Table 2 is an arbitrary decision but falls well within a nominal P -value of 0.01, which could be calculated by prioritising the extreme 1% from the full data set. The downregulation of mRNA encoding slow twitch subunits TNNC1 and MYH7 is apparent in the mutant BA at 210\u2005days ( Table S2 ) and 260\u2005days ( Table 3 ). While the DE of these mRNA may appear modest in absolute terms, it should be emphasized that (1) they do rank as extreme by a modified DE that accounts for data distribution [see Phenotypic Impact Factor (PIF) below]; (2) they are coordinately expressed so the collective observation is arguably more convincing than a single mRNA taken in isolation; (3) the same gene expression change is observed in other MSTN mutant models; (4) we have phenotyped these animals at the protein level, and the mRNA and protein data are mutually reinforcing. Finally, the highly divergent expression of the female X chromosome silencing non-coding RNA XIST at many time points reflects a gender imbalance in the experimental design. View this table: Top 20 abundant up- and downregulated genes in BA minus CH at 260\u2005dpc Breed contrast using PIF We have previously found that multiplying the differentially expressed genes by their average abundance in the two treatments (PIF) is a robust preliminary step for functional enrichment analysis, as well as being an analytical step in the regulatory impact factor (RIF) analysis differential connectivity (DC) analysis ( Hudson et al., 2009a , 2012 ) described later. PIF emphasizes those genes that are substantially differentially expressed as well as abundant and de-emphasizes those molecules that may be highly differentially expressed but so lowly expressed that they approach the detection limit of the technology where the data are noisier. First of all, we computed PIF on a time-point specific basis for all genes ( Table S3 ). The functional enrichments by GOrilla for the extreme 1% from the entire gene lists ranked on PIF are listed in Table S2 . We next focussed more specifically on 260\u2005dpc, when mature muscle has been developed and the postnatal growth potential for the animal has been set up. MSTN receives the fifth highest score for genes upregulated in BA ( Table 3 ). Of the four genes awarded higher scores than MSTN , XIST generates a non-coding RNA expressed in female tissue to silence expression from one of the two X chromosomes. JSP.1 encodes an MHC class I protein. UPK2 encodes a membrane protein that is present in endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. CTDSP2 encodes a protein that co-regulates androgen receptor activity. The fibre shift to a faster glycolytic phenotype in the MSTN mutant BA is apparent through relative downregulation of TNNC1 and MYH7 ( Table 3 ). Comparison of muscle physiology to MSTN mutant Piedmontese We attempted to find commonalities between the observed muscle structural DE (driven by the TNNC1 , MYH7 , TPM3 and CSRP3 observations described above) with that made in a different MSTN mutant system from an entirely independent animal trial. Exploration of the birth time point in an equivalent comparison ( Hudson et al., 2009a ) between MSTN mutant Piedmontese cross bred animals versus MSTN wild-type Wagyu cross bred animals found the same slow twitch subunits downregulated in the mutant breed ( TPM3 , CSRP3 , MYH7B , TNNC1 ). The exception is MYL2 , which is not differentially expressed in the BA versus CH ( Table S4 ). Mitochondrial physiology Citrate synthase (CS) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene, indicative of aerobic capacity and mitochondrial content. The presence of CS mRNA as upregulated in BA at 260\u2005dpc ( Table 3 ) is contrary to our expectation by fibre composition (>fast glycolytic) and also contrary to previously documented biochemical assay data for the oxidative enzymes citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase. This conflicting observation prompted a deeper exploration of the mitochondrial proteome to determine whether this was a general trend or specific to this particular gene. In order to determine whether there are substantial differences in muscle mitochondrial physiology between BA and CH animals by birth, we quantified the changes in the mitochondrial proteome at the mRNA level. A mitoproteome list including both mitochondrial and nuclear encoded transcripts contained 1289 proteins. We identified 514 matches including duplicates in our data (20,354 probes). The underestimate reflects mismatches due to gene aliases and/or gene names versus protein names. We attempted to get a global perspective on mitochondrial expression between the two breeds ( Fig. 2 ). Comparing all the data with respect to the 0 baseline, 169 mRNA were higher in BA but more than double that were higher in CH (345), a highly significant deviation from the null expectation of 50:50 equilibrium ( P =3.21 e \u221215 ; binomial test statistic). Download powerpoint Fig. 2. mRNA encoding the mitoproteome. Overlaying the mRNA encoding the mitoproteome onto the 260\u2005days MA plot illustrates a significant skew towards the CH, consistent with the expectation of lower oxidative capacity in the fast, glycolytic musculature of the BA. The transcript abundance of the mRNA encoding the mitoproteome was therefore skewed towards the slow, oxidative CH. While it is not clear exactly how patterns of mitochondrial gene expression reflects mitochondrial content (as opposed to mitochondrial activity), this finding is certainly consistent with a reduction in mitochondrial content in the MSTN mutant fast glycolytic BA muscle tissue. This result meets our expectation given the CS biochemical data (an established proxy of mitochondrial content), and as indicated by the fibre histology data being skewed away from the oxidative mitochondrial rich fibres. Nevertheless, a substantial number of mRNA-encoding mitochondrial proteins are more highly expressed in the BA despite the lower mitochondrial content. These include GMPPB , ACYP2 , TFAM , ACSF2 , UXS1 and MRS2 . They imply some changes to isolated mitochondrial performance/metabolism in the BA versus CH animals that cannot be simply explained by reduced mitochondrial content. Most prominently upregulated in the CH include GSTK1 , ACACB , PXMP2 and ADCK3 . DC The two complementary DC scores (RIF scores) were computed in a manner taking into account correlations computed across the four developmental time points for 870 regulatory molecules identified in the data ( Table S5 ). They were plotted and manually explored to identify regulatory molecules at the extremes. The RIF data become more sparse at the very extremes, indicating that most regulatory molecules are not behaving differently between the BA and CH but a smaller subset are substantially rewired. We focussed on those molecules that were deemed extreme by both versions of RIF. MSTN , which harbours a causal double-muscling mutation in BA ( Bouyer et al., 2014 ), possessed strong negative RIF1 and RIF2 values, so when graphed was positioned at one of the extremes in the bottom left quadrant in Fig. 3 . Given that there is a MSTN mutation in BA, this observation can be used to ground-truth the utility of our approach. The regulatory molecule for which behaviour was most like MSTN was NRIP2 ( Fig. 3 ). Other molecules prominently displayed by the RIF plot include TAF12 , MBD1 , NMI , PROX1 and OVGP1. The muscle regulatory factors ( MYOD1 , MYOG , MYF5 and MEF2C ) showed only modest evidence for rewiring, implying the MSTN mutation's impact acts relatively independent of them. Finally, we overlaid known master regulators (including both drivers and suppressors) of mitochondrial content harvested from a number of literature searches. Of the 29 for which we have RIF data, the most prominently rewired were TFB1M ( Falkenberg et al., 2002 ) and DGUOK ( Mousson de Camaret et al., 2007 ). Interestingly, 23 of the 29 mitochondrial content regulators were awarded positive (rather than negative) RIF2 scores, a significant enrichment (binomial P =0.0013) for which we have no explanation. Download powerpoint Fig. 3. RIF1 and RIF2 plotted for all transcriptional regulators. Molecules at the extremes of the distribution are highly differentially connected in developing skeletal muscle when comparing the two breeds. They may or may not be differentially expressed. Regulators of mitochondrial content and MSTN have been highlighted, along with a variety of extreme performers. Hierarchical clustering Finally, we represented a number of outlier genes, both highly developmentally regulated, highly differentially expressed and highly differential connected as a heat map hierarchically clustered on rows ( Fig. 4 ). The clusters highlight patterns of tight co-expression across the eight treatments. Notable highly co-expressed genes include TNNC1, TPM3 and MYH7 . These three genes encode contractile proteins all of which are highly expressed in slow twitch fibres. The clustering of mRNA that encode clearly functionally related proteins is an indication of data robustness. Download powerpoint Fig. 4. A hierarchically clustered heat map of normalized mean expression values with treatments as columns and genes as rows. The genes selected for hierarchical clustering have been emphasized in this manuscript because of high developmental regulation ( MYL4, MYH3, C13H20ORF194, CKMT2 and MYH1 ), high DE between the breeds ( TPM3, MYH7, TNNC1, CSRP3, MSTN ) or high DC between the breeds ( MSTN, NRIP2 and TFB1M ). Red represents high expression and green represents low expression. A number of tight co-expression relationships are apparent, including that of TNNC1, TPM3 and MYH7 , all of which encode contractile subunits predominantly expressed in slow twitch fibres. We also wished to explore whether the individual normalized biological replicates are representative of the group means we have been using. Reassuringly, a small panel of five genes, the expression of which was identified as highly developmentally regulated in both breeds ( MYL4, MYH3, MYH1, CKMT2 and C13H20ORF194 ) were collectively able to cluster the samples into the developmental treatment group of origin i.e. the individual samples for d110 clustering with other samples from d110 and so on through each developmental group ( Fig. S2 ). Moreover, the top 20 most upregulated and top 20 most downregulated genes in BA versus CH animals at d260 were able to cluster the animals by breed ( Fig. 5 ). Both matrices were also clustered on rows to identify genes co-expressed across treatments of interest. In addition to the clustering of mRNA encoding slow twitch proteins as described above, we also determined the very tight co-expression of mRNA ( AARS, SARS and IARS with GARS only slightly removed) encoding different tRNA synthetases. The biologically meaningful nature of the clusters on both columns and rows is an indication that the individual samples perform in a similar manner to the treatment means and therefore can be considered reliable in terms of signal to noise. Download powerpoint Fig. 5. The hierarchically-clustered heatmap for the individual normalized mean expression values for the 40 most differentially expressed genes between BA and CH at d260. This panel of 40 DE genes is able to correctly cluster the individual samples into the appropriate breed treatment group at this time point. This suggests that the treatment means we used as the basis for much of the analysis are reasonable representations of the full data set. DISCUSSION The BA is a feed efficient, hypermuscular breed whose muscularity is not present at birth but rather appears during early postnatal development. However, like most mammals the muscle potential is set by birth because of fibre number determination ( Bonnet et al., 2010 ). This means hypermuscularity is achieved by hypertrophy of a set of existing fibres, not by the addition of new fibres (B.P., unpublished data). Compared to the CH, it is possible that the BA is still undergoing hyperplasia at 180\u2005dpc. If true, this extension of hyperplasia in BA may increase the total number of fibres available for postnatal hypertrophy, with implications for enhancing muscle mass. We have characterized the molecular differences between the two breeds during prenatal development \u2013 when the muscle program is being set up \u2013 using a set of genome-wide transcriptome analyses. Strictly speaking, our approach on ranked genome-wide lists only allowed us to interpret biological processes on the 16 foetuses we studied. Whether these data can be extrapolated to a larger population of BA and CH foetuses remains to be evaluated, although many of our molecular findings do fit with our biological expectations of the two breeds. Before describing the contrasts between the breeds, we will briefly comment on developmental programs they have in common, and which have previously been observed in other species of cattle. Developmental profiles common to both breeds In both breeds the most developmentally regulated genes include embryonic muscle subunit isoforms (e.g. MYL4, MYH3 ), the expression of which drops dramatically prior to birth when they are replaced by adult isoforms ( MYH1 ); metabolic enzymes (e.g. the mitochondrially localized CKMT2 and AGXT2L1 ) that prepare the foetus for functional independence postpartum, as seen at the protein level ( Chaze et al., 2008 ); and a gene of unknown function ( C13H20ORF194 ). Overall, these muscle subunit and metabolic changes are consistent with previous results on MyHC abundances ( Picard et al., 2002 ) and also on m. Semitendinosus proteomic analyses ( Chaze et al., 2008 ; Chaze et al., 2009 ) observed during the foetal stages in CH. Similarly, these basic changes were also observed in an independent mRNA developmental analysis of Wagyu by Hereford breed cross Longissimus muscle ( Hudson et al., 2013 ).The dramatic increase in C13H20ORF194 has also been described in the prenatal developing muscle of Wagyu by Hereford animals ( Hudson et al., 2013 ). To better understand the significance of C13H20ORF194 , we performed some basic bioinformatic analysis using The Human Protein Atlas ( http://www.proteinatlas.org ) and the TIGER tissue-specific expression database ( Liu et al., 2008 ). It appears that C13H20ORF194 encodes a large protein that is highly conserved across the vertebrates. There is some evidence for cytoplasmic localization and it possesses a strong coiled-coil domain at the C-terminus. According to the Mammalian Phenotype Browser, the encoded protein plays a role in metabolism ( http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:1923029 ) and there is evidence for expression in skeletal muscle based on both NGS and SAGE ( http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=C20orf194 ). In light of these prior findings and our own expression data, we hypothesize that there would be value in functionally characterising this protein as it looks to play a role in developing production animal muscle. BA versus CH The two major structural and functional changes associated postnatally with the MSTN mutation in addition to an increase in muscle mass are (1) a shift to a faster muscle isoforms and (2) a decrease in mitochondrial content. The latter is because the faster muscle fibres are predominantly geared towards glycolytic rather than oxidative metabolism. In relaxed or gently exercising muscle the \u2018glycolytic\u2019 fibres would still be expected to convert energy aerobically, given aerobic metabolism is the only sustainable source of ATP, and can provide an adequate ATP supply under conditions of low demand. We fibre typed the animals using immunohistochemistry, finding substantially less oxidative type I fibres and substantially more type II fibres in the BA. These basic physiology results are similar to data obtained in double-muscled cattle compared to non-double-muscled cattle and to cattle selected on their muscle growth potential ( Bouley et al., 2005 ; Deveaux et al., 2001 ; Gagni\u00e8re et al., 1997 ; Picard et al., 2006 ). Both these functional changes are evident at the mRNA level. First, we find a decrease in expression of a number of slow twitch subunits in BA cattle in one or both of the later developmental time points ( TPM3 , CSRP3 , MYH7 and TNNC1 ), some of which (e.g. TNNC1 and MYH7 ) are highly positively co-expressed. This suggests not only that the BA possesses a shift towards fast, glycolytic muscle but that this is already apparent at the 210\u2005dpc time point prior to birth. Interestingly, all of these subunits are also relatively reduced at similar time points in another MSTN mutant, the Piedmontese ( Hudson et al., 2009a ). One subtle difference is the expression of MYL2 which surprisingly is not relatively downregulated in BA. This may reflect the different genetic backgrounds against which the MSTN mutation is expressed. Second, we observe that the majority of mRNA encoding the mitoproteome for which we have data (345 of 514 proteins or 68% of the total) are downregulated in BA. This is consistent with a reduction in mitochondrial content in BA muscle and aligns with our expectation based on both CS biochemical activity and fibre histology. The consistent upregulation of interferon signalling apparatus in the BA compared to the CH at multiple time points is an unresolved mystery at this stage. However, one possible explanation relates to the known ability of interferon to promote muscle healing through formation of new muscle fibres ( Cheng et al., 2008 ). Alternatively, the result may reflect the immune systems utility in a monitoring and signalling capacity as previously been observed for toll receptors and hematopoietic homeostasis ( Cannova et al., 2015 ). A third more prosaic possibility is that these data simply reflect breed-specific MHC haplotypes being manifested in a muscle context. Interestingly, at d260, we found coordinate downregulation of four transcripts (AARS, SARS, IARS and GARS) encoding different tRNA synthetases, perhaps indicating reduced protein synthesis in the BA. At 260\u2005dpc MSTN is the fifth most upregulated gene in BA. Of the four genes more upregulated than MSTN ( XIST, JSP.1, UPK2 and CTDSP2 ), XIST (X chromosome inactivation) and CTDSP2 (androgen receptor regulation) may be a reflection of gender imbalance in the experimental design. A subset of the extreme DE genes show high individual variability, and their potential role in the process under investigation can be considered less likely. Next, we were interested in the regulatory machinery that may be driving the changes in fibre composition and mitochondrial content. We made use of our DC analysis (RIF), which was developed on a cattle muscle developmental system similar to this one ( Hudson et al., 2009a ), but subsequently applied in a diverse range of circumstances to unravel the molecular basis of cancer ( Reverter et al., 2010 ), cell determination pathways ( Reverter et al., 2010 ), the impact of hormone growth promotants ( De Jager et al., 2011 ) and several human neurodegenerative diseases ( Rhinn et al., 2013 ; Rhinn et al., 2012 ). The basis of the analysis is to ask the question \u2018which transcriptional regulator changes its network topology the most between the two breeds?\u2019 Regulators with markedly different network topologies may or may not be differentially expressed themselves, so the approach can be considered complementary to conventional DE-based analyses. We find MSTN to be extremely differentially connected between the breeds as expected. Further, we find that another regulator ( NRIP2 ) has a very similar change in behaviour to MSTN , implying a hitherto unrecognized role in driving the muscle mass, fibre composition and mitochondrial content phenotype change in MSTN mutant animals. NRIP2 is a poorly characterized molecule, the protein of which is thought to interact with regulators of metabolism such as NR1F2, RARA and THRB. We hypothesize that NRIP2 deserves more scrutiny in a production muscle context. In this experiment, the anticipated change in MSTN activity is also detectable by DE as the mRNA is prominently differentially expressed between the breeds at all time points. However, the direction of change (higher expression in the more muscular breed) is opposite to that predicted by its functional outcome (as it is a repressor of muscle mass). MSTN higher expression in the BA may represent an attempt to restore tissue mass homeostasis, while its DC likely reflects the loss of growth repression by the dysfunctional protein. We wish to point out that these BA foetuses have not been genotyped for the mutation. Typically, 80% of BA carry the mutated transcript, and it works in correspondence with the wild-type transcript to drive muscle mass (I.C.-M., unpublished data). In a similar experiment comparing MSTN mutant Piedmontese and Wagyu ( Hudson et al., 2009a ), we made slightly different observations: while we were able to identify the differential activity/behaviour of MSTN through DC, this was in the absence of any DE. Finally, in the specific context of reduced mitochondrial content in BA versus CH we found evidence for substantial rewiring of the master regulator of mitochondrial transcription and biogenesis, TFB1M . CONCLUSIONS We have used global gene expression analyses to better understand the molecular basis of high muscling in the MSTN mutant BA. A number of regulatory genes have been identified as behaving differently between the two breeds, some through conventional DE and some through DC. Interestingly, the influence of the causal MSTN mutation was highlighted through both DE and DC. A number of molecular observations made here in mutant BA are concordant with a previously published comparison between the Longissimus muscle of MSTN mutant Piedmontese by Hereford crosses versus Wagyu by Hereford crosses ( Hudson et al., 2009a ). This includes the gene expression evidence for a fibre composition shift towards the low mitochondrial content glycolytic fibres. Overall, these comparisons imply some common muscle biology across these different hyper-muscular breeds that transcend the particular muscle selected for analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animal resources CH and BA fetuses were generated by artificial insemination of CH and BA primiparous cows with CH and BA bull sperm, respectively, at the INRA experimental farm, located at Theix near Clermont Ferrand, France. Fetuses were collected from cows slaughtered at the INRA experimental abattoir at 110 ( n =3/breed), 180 ( n =3/breed), 210 ( n =3/breed) and 260 ( n =3/breed) dpc. The collection of fetuses at these stages was completed to target the proliferation of foetal myoblasts (110\u2005dpc), the end of proliferation (180\u2005dpc), the contractile and metabolic differentiation of fibres, and the perinatal period, respectively. The m. Semitendinosus muscle was sampled for histochemistry, biochemistry and transcriptomics according to ( Cassar-Malek et al., 2010 ). All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee in accordance with the Use of Vertebrates for Scientific Purposes Act 1985. The foetuses were collected respecting broadly recognized ethical standards, although a formal ethical evaluation was not mandatory at the time of this experiment. Histology Serial sections (10\u2005\u00b5m) were cut perpendicular to the m. Semitendinosus muscle fibres on a cryostat at \u221225\u00b0C. Contractile type was determined using anti-MyHC antibodies. Briefly, serial transverse sections were incubated with specific monoclonal antibodies ( Picard et al., 1998 ) raised either against the slow (5B9) or the fast (F113 15F4) or a combination of slow and fast IIx (F5 8H2) or of the foetal F (4C10) MyHC categories. Immune complexes were revealed using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (Interchim, Montilu\u00e7on, France). Immunofluorescent staining was analysed in two zones under a microscope (Labophot-2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a fluorescent light (excitation filter 450 to 490\u2005nm and stop filter 520\u2005nm). The determination of fibre types and their frequencies expressed as a percentage was based on 200 fibres per cross section. Muscle areas from exactly the same position were analysed. RNA extraction and microarray hybridization Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen m. Semitendinosus tissue stored at -80\u00b0C using Trizol following the manufacturer's instructions. A Purelink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) was used followed by a Dnase treatment (Qiagen). Then, 50\u2005ng total RNA was amplified and fluorescently labelled to produce Cy3 cRNA using the Low Input Quick Amp Labeling One Color Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). After purification (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen), 1650\u2005ng labelled cRNA was hybridized onto G2519F 023647 Bovine v2 GE 4\u00d744\u2005K microarray (Agilent) with hybridization buffer (Gene Expression Hybridization Kit, Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 17\u2005h of hybridization, slides were washed with the Gene Expression Wash Pack (Agilent). Microarrays were scanned with an Agilent G2505 scanner. Based on considerations of quality control we generated microarray data for the following subset of samples: 110d (BA n =3, CH n =2), 180\u2005days (BA n =2, CH=3), 210\u2005days (BA n =3, CH n =3), 260\u2005days (BA n =2, CH n =3). Data normalization Within and between array normalization was performed as previously described ( Hocquette et al., 2012 ) Data were extracted and normalized with Feature Extraction 10.7 software (Agilent) using background and multiplicative detrend (no background subtraction). The mean intensity between the technical replicates was then calculated for each probe. Normalized log2 mean intensity (Cy3) were used. Data were submitted to GEO and published under accession number GSE60844 . Calculation of DE DE was calculated using the LIMMA method ( Smyth et al., 2005 ) with a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. Very few significant DE genes were identified using this method. Consequently, we proceeded with a less stringent approach, relying on ranked genome-wide lists to biologically interpret the data. These approaches are less dependent on the significance of any one gene, but rather explore patterns of functional enrichment detected in large lists. All the downstream analyses can then focus on either the extremes of ranked lists using nominal P -values (top 1% or 5% of the genes in the list) or exploiting the entire ranked list for functional enrichment analysis using GOrilla ( Eden et al., 2009 ) in which case no nominal threshold needs to be set. We focussed on the \u2018Process\u2019 level ontology for reporting in this manuscript. To compute the MA plots between the breeds the average abundance and the DE (BA \u2013 CH) was computed for each gene at each time point. To ensure a more manageable data set for plotting we filtered to include all those genes minimally DE (a log2 difference of 0.5 equating to a fold change of 1.41). This yielded 2911, 1599, 966 and 1031 genes for 110, 180, 210 and 260\u2005days, respectively, reflecting a reduction in breed difference as the muscle developmental program unfolds. We also computed a cumulative \u2018overall\u2019 DE by summing the absolute DE at each time point and then ranking on the sum. We generated a ranked list of developmentally regulated genes by ranking on standard deviation across the four time points for the BA. Comparison to MSTN mutant Piedmontese versus wild-type Wagyu We attempted to find commonalities between the BA versus CH muscle structural DE with that made in an independent MSTN mutant system. We made use of the published data comparing MSTN mutant Piedmontese by Hereford crosses versus MSTN wild-type Wagyu by Hereford crosses ( Hudson et al., 2009a ), examining DE (Piedmontese minus Wagyu) of the slow muscle subunits at the 280\u2005days peri-natal period. Quantifying the mitoproteome in BA versus CH We filtered the 260\u2005days data with a comprehensive mitoproteome list derived from http://mitominer.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/release-3.1/begin.do . This list includes mitochondrially encoded proteins as well as the much more numerous nuclear-encoded proteins. We generated a gene list with no duplicates and based our gene list on the human data (as opposed to the mouse data) in the mitominer database. Calculation of PIF Next we computed PIFs for each gene at each time point by multiplying average abundance by breed DE as previously described ( Hudson et al., 2009a ). We ranked the lists and explored for functional enrichment by hypergeometric statistics using GOrilla analysis. We used the two list import option, with a background list of 19,100 genes and target lists derived from the extreme 191 (nominal 1%) up- and downregulated. Calculation of DC We calculated RIF1 and RIF2 DC scores using the methods outlined in Hudson et al. (2009a) and Reverter et al. (2010) . In brief, to identify transcription factors and other regulatory molecules that have been rewired in the BA we applied our recently developed RIF analysis. We identified the regulatory molecules using Genomatix software as detailed in Hudson et al. (2009b) . As we previously described ( Hudson et al., 2015 ), the RIF procedure exploits global patterns of differential co-expression (or \u2018differential wiring\u2019) to infer those regulatory molecules for which behaviour is systematically different in a contrast of interest, in this case BA versus CH m. Semitendinosus muscle. RIF metrics for the r -th regulator were computed using the following formulae: and where n DE represented the number of DE genes; was the average expression of the j -th DE gene across all time points; was the DE of the j -th gene in the BA versus CH contrast; was the differential co-expression between the r -th regulator and the j -th DE gene, and computed from the difference between and , the correlation co-expression between the r -th regulator and the j -th DE gene in the BA and CH samples, respectively; and represented the average expression of the j-th DE or TS gene in the BA and CH samples, respectively. Hierarchical clustering of both developmentally and breed regulated genes We created a matrix of normalized mean expression values with as many columns as treatments (8) and as many rows as genes (12). The 12 genes were selected for deeper analysis on the basis of extreme developmental regulation ( MYH1, MYL4, MYH3, CKMT2, C13H20ORF194 ) or extreme breed DE ( MSTN, CSRP3, TNNC1, MYH7 and TPM3 ) or extreme DC ( MSTN, NRIP2, TFB1M ). The matrix was imported into Permut Matrix software ( Caraux and Pinloche, 2005 ), normalized on rows, and then hierarchically clustered on rows to highlight genes co-expressed across the eight treatments. Clustered genes were explored for functional relatedness of the encoded proteins. In a complementary analysis, we also explored the numerical behaviour of the individual biological replicates to see if they were representative of the treatment means. Two matrices of individual normalized mean expression were generated to be imported into Permut Matrix for hierarchical cluster analysis. The first matrix was to test the performance of those genes previously highlighted as developmentally regulated. Are those individual normalized expression values correctly able to discriminate the samples into developmental group of origin? This matrix had 21 columns (all individual values across the eight treatments) and five rows (representing the developmentally regulated genes MYL4, MYH3, MYH1, CKMT2 and C13H20ORF194 ). The second was to test the performance of those genes previously highlighted as having substantial DE between the breeds at d260 when the muscle has reached its mature form. Are those individual normalized expression values correctly able to discriminate the samples into the breed of origin? This matrix had five columns (individual values across d260 samples only) and 40 rows (the 20 most up- and downregulated genes at d260 in BA versus CH as determined by PIF). In both cases the matrices were imported into Permut Matrix software, normalized on rows, then hierarchically clustered on both rows and columns.

Pant Cytoskeletal Protein Regulation Section , National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health , Bethesda, MD 20892 , USA PDF ABSTRACT Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of the heavy neurofilament subunit (NF-H) impacts neurofilament (NF) axonal transport and residence within axons by fostering NF-NF associations that compete with transport. We tested the role of phosphorylation of a GSK-3\u03b2 consensus site (S493) located in the proximal portion of the NF-H tail in NF dynamics by transfection of NB2a/d1 cells with NF-H, where S493 was mutated to aspartic acid (S493D) or to alanine (S493A) to mimic constitutive phosphorylation and non-phosphorylation. S493D underwent increased transport into axonal neurites, while S493A displayed increased perikaryal NF aggregates that were decorated by anti-kinesin. Increased levels of S493A co-precipitated with anti-kinesin indicating that reduced transport of S493A was not due to reduced kinesin association but due to premature NF-NF interactions within perikarya. S493D displayed increased phospho-immunoreactivity within axonal neurites at downstream C-terminal sites attributable to mitogen-activated protein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase 5. However, S493D was more prone to proteolysis following kinase inhibition, suggesting that S493 phosphorylation is an early event that alters sidearm configuration in a manner that promotes appropriate NF distribution. We propose a novel model for sidearm configuration. INTRODUCTION The cytoskeleton provides structural support to axons allowing for axonal outgrowth and for maintenance of synaptic connections formed by outgrowing axons ( Luo, 2002 ; Barnes and Polleux, 2009 ; Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2011 ). Mammalian neurofilaments (NFs), a major constituent of the axonal cytoskeleton, are composed of three subunits termed NF-light, -medium, and -heavy (NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H, respectively) in reference to their relative molecular mass ( Julien and Mushynski, 1998 ), as well as \u03b1-internexin and peripherin ( Yuan et al., 2006 , 2012 ). The C-terminal tail domains of NF-H and NF-M undergo extensive post-translational modification by phosphorylation ( Julien and Mushynski, 1982 ; Carden et al., 1985 ; Jones and Williams, 1982 ; Lee et al., 2014 ). Phosphorylation of the NF-H tail domain induces divalent cation-mediated NF-NF associations. These associations both regulate the formation of the axonal NF cytoskeletal array and foster at least transient withdrawal of NFs from the transporting pool ( Leterrier and Eyer, 1987 ; Gou et al., 1998 ; Chen et al., 2000 ; Yabe et al., 1999 , 2001 ; Uchida et al., 2009 ; Ackerley et al., 2003 ; Jung and Shea, 1999 ; Shea and Lee, 2013 ; Lee et al., 2014 ). C-terminal phosphorylation also precludes NF proteolysis and increases NF residence time within axons ( Lee et al., 2014 ; Pant and Veeranna, 1995 ; Greenwood et al., 1993 ; Nixon, 1993 ; Goldstein et al., 1987 ; Fiumelli et al., 2008 ; Grant et al., 2001 ). These collective phosphorylation events are mediated by an interactive network of kinases and phosphatases that regulate NF transport and incorporation into the axonal cytoskeleton including: cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk5), mitogen activated kinases (MAPKs), casein kinase 1 and 2 (CK1 and CK2), glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b1 and 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2), p38 MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNKs) and protein phosphatases 1, 2A and 2B (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, respectively) ( Lee et al., 2014 ; Pant and Veeranna, 1995 , and references therein). A GSK3\u03b2 consensus sequence is located at the beginning of the NF-H tail domain; however, the consequences of phosphorylation of this site remain unclear ( Sasaki et al., 2002 , 2009 ). To probe the impact of S493 phosphorylation on NF dynamics, we generated phosphomimetic (S493D) and phosphorylation-deficient (S493A) mutations of this site. As demonstrated herein, pseudo-phosphorylation of S493 increased downstream NF-H C-terminal phosphorylation events and increased NF-H accumulation within axonal NFs, while prevention of S493 phosphorylation instead fostered perikaryal NF aggregates. However, pseudo-phosphorylation of S493 also rendered NF-H more susceptible to proteolysis. Our findings suggest that S493 phosphorylation occurs relatively early during the phosphorylation cascade of the NF-H tail domain, and that S493 phosphorylation induces one or more conformational changes in the NF-H C-terminal tail domain that regulate NF dynamics. RESULTS Following knockdown of endogenous NF-H and expression of NF constructs, a significant increase in S493D was observed within axonal neurites versus that of wtH or S493A, while reduced levels of S493A were observed within axonal neurites verus wtH ( Fig. 1 A). Cells expressing S493A displayed a significant increase in cells exhibiting GFP-tagged perikaryal aggregates versus those of cells expressing wtH or S493D ( Fig. 1 A). These findings suggest that phosphorylation of S493 promotes transport of NF-H into and along axons, and/or accumulation within axons, while the prevention of S493 phosphorylation disrupts normal transport and results in aberrant accumulation of NF-H within soma.

The accompanying graphs present the ratio of the neurite/somal phospho-H immunoreactivity (left) and the mean percentage of cells displaying phospho-H-immunoreactive perikaryal aggregates from \u22653 independent experiments. Note the increased percentage of S493A-cells displaying perikaryal phospho-H aggregates. Error bars in A and B represent \u00b1s.e.; ** P <0.05 (ANOVA). To examine the potential effect of S493 phosphorylation on downstream NF-H tail domain phosphorylation, immunoblots were probed with monoclonal antibody RT97, which reacts with a conformationally dependent phospho-epitope located within the NF-H tail downstream of S493 ( Veeranna et al., 2008 ). Cytoskeleton-associated RT97 was significantly increased in cells expressing S493D versus S493A and wtH ( Fig. 1 B), suggesting that phosphorylation of the S493 site potentiates incorporation of NFs into the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescent analysis displayed more phospho-H in axons of cells expressing S493D versus those expressing wtH or S493A. Conversely, cells expressing S493A displayed an increase in RT97-reactive perikaryal aggregates versus cells expressing wtH or S493D. Moreover, cells expressing S493D displayed a decrease in perikaryal aggregates versus wtH cells ( Fig. 1 B). Association of NF-H, S493A, and S493D with kinesin (which transports NF-H into and along axons; Yabe et al., 1999 , 2000 ) was assessed via immunoprecipitation of motor proteins followed by immunoblot analyses to detect any co-precipitated NF-H ( Fig. 2 A). Unexpectedly, anti-kinesin co-precipitated significantly more S493A than wtH or S493D, suggesting that reduction in axonal S493A was not derived from restriction in the ability of S493A to associate with kinesin. The increased association of S493 with kinesin was unlikely to be due to an undetermined artifact, since similar levels of all three constructs were precipitated by anti-GFP ( Fig. 2 A).

(B) Representative images of transfected cells following reaction with anti-kinesin along with corresponding images of the distribution of GFP. The first image presents a representative cell from a transfected culture displaying no detectable GFP but with the minor \u2018leak\u2019 of fluorescent signal (arrows; compare with the intensity of the cell present in the upper right). The accompanying graph presents quantification of somal/neurite kinesin or GFP immunoreactivity in arbitrary densitometric units. Values represent the mean\u00b1s.e. Considerable variation was displayed among cells but note the increase in somal/neurite ratio of both kinesin and GFP for cells expressing S493A. ** P <0.05, * P <0.1; ANOVA. Immunofluorescent analyses of the distribution of kinesin within soma and neurites were conducted to address further the relative increase in association of S493A with kinesin. Considerable variation was displayed among cells expressing all constructs, but we noted an increase in kinesin within soma versus neurites for cells expressing S493A ( Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest that the increased co-precipitation of S493A by anti-kinesin may have resulted at least in part by sequestering of kinesin by S493A aggregated within soma, since NF aggregates have previously been shown to bind motor proteins including kinesin ( Shea and Beaty, 2007 ; Toyoshima et al., 1998 ). To examine directly whether or not phosphorylation of S493 increased NF-H steady-state levels, and, if so, the responsible mechanism(s), we manipulated the activity of a number of known NF kinases (MAPK, cdk5, CK1\u03b1, and GSK3\u03b2) in cells expressing wtH, S493A and S493D ( Fig. 3 A). Upregulation of cdk5 activity (by expression of its activator p35; e.g. Lee et al., 2014 ) and Ck1\u03b1 each increased Triton-soluble S493D. Upregulation of CDK5, Ck1\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2 each increased Triton-soluble S493A, but not significantly. Consistent with the increased levels of S493D observed within axonal neurites, increased levels of S493D were observed within the Triton-insoluble fraction versus wtH or S493A prior to kinase manipulation, and were significantly increased following upregulation of cdk5 and GSK3\u03b2 ( Fig. 3 ). Triton-insoluble wtH was also increased following upregulation of cdk5, while levels of Triton-insoluble S493A were increased (but not significantly) following upregulation of cdk5, Ck1\u03b1 and GSK3\u03b2. The relatively larger effects of kinase upregulation on S493D levels suggests that phosphorylation of S493 increases the ability of the NF-H tail domain to undergo additional phosphorylation events.

Nitrocellulose replicas probed with anti-GFP of Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions from cells of cells expressing wtH, S493A or S493D (H, A, D, respectively) and co-transfected with the indicated kinases. Note that upregulation of cdk5 (by expression of its activator, p35), and GSK3\u03b2 increased insoluble S493D, while upregulation of CDK5 and CK1\u03b1 increased soluble S493D. Breakdown products (not included in quantification) were increased in all samples following calpain inhibition. Error bars indicate mean\u00b1s.e. ** P <0.05, * P <0.1; ANOVA. Since NF steady-state levels are regulated by proteolysis, and proteolysis is suppressed by MAPk and cdk5 phosphorylation events ( Lee et al., 2014 and references therein), we examined the consequences of manipulation of calpain activity. Calpain inhibition did not alter levels of Triton-insoluble wtH, S493A or S493D (not shown), but significantly increased Triton-soluble levels of all three constructs, confirming that steady-state levels of all three constructs were regulated by calpain ( Figs 4 and 5 ). GFP-immunoreactive NF-H proteolytic fragments migrating at approximately 130-140\u2005kDa, 110-120\u2005kDa, and 100\u2005kDa were observed ( Figs 4 and 5 ). Retention of GFP-immunoreactivity in all breakdown products indicates proteolytic cleavage from the C-terminal end of the protein, as the GFP-tag is N-terminally located. Upregulation of all NF kinases increased the number of proteolytic fragments following expression of all constructs ( Fig. 3 ). Only the largest of these fragments retained the RT97 epitope (located within the C-terminal tail and generated by MAPk and cdk5) ( Veeranna et al., 2008 ) ( Fig. 4 ). Calpain inhibition further preserved these proteolytic fragments, suggesting that these fragments otherwise underwent continued degradation by calpain-mediated proteolysis ( Figs 4 and 5 ). The 110-120\u2005kDa fragment was only present in cells expressing S493D ( Fig. 4 ), suggesting that phosphorylation of S493D altered sidearm proteolysis and/or placed the sidearm at increased risk for proteolysis; this particular fragment could be generated by cleavage within the MAPK and/or CDK5 consensus sites, since inhibition of these kinases promotes NF-H proteolysis ( Pant, 1988 ; Lee et al., 2014 ).

Nitrocellulose replicas probed with anti-GFP or RT97 of Triton-soluble fractions from cells of cells expressing wtH, S493A or S493D (H, A, D, respectively) \u00b1inhibitors active against MAPK (PD98059), CDK5 (Roscovitine), CK1\u03b1 (D4476), GSK3\u03b2 (Lithium), and calpain (calpain inhibitor III) as indicated. The accompanying graphs present quantification of GFP, and phospho-H immunoreactivity corresponding to full-length NF-H (mean\u00b1s.e. from three independent experiments). Note that GFP-S493D exhibits the largest reduction following inhibition of all NF kinases individually: calpain inhibitor prevented the decline observed following inhibition of MAPK or CDK5. RT97 immunoreactivity was not reduced by kinase inhibition, but was increased by inhibition of cdk5, calpain, and simultaneous inhibition of all four kinases+calpain. Inhibition of calpain increased soluble levels of all three constructs. Breakdown products (not included in quantification) were increased in all samples following calpain inhibition. ** P <0.05, * P <0.1; ANOVA. Download powerpoint Fig. 5. Phosphorylation of S493 increases the susceptibility of NF-H to proteolysis. Panels present nitrocellulose replicas probed with anti-GFP or anti-phospho-H (RT97) of Triton-insoluble fractions from cells of cells expressing wtH, S493A or S493D (H, A, D, respectively) \u00b1inhibitors active against MAPK (PD98059), CDK5 (Roscovitine), CK1\u03b1 (D4476) and GSK3\u03b2 (Lithium). The accompanying graphs present quantification of wtH, S493A, and S493D, and phospho-H (RT97) (mean\u00b1s.e. from three independent experiments). Phospho-H was depleted in S493D-cells to a greater extent than in wtH- or S493A-cells following inhibition of CDK5, CDK5+MAPK, CK1\u03b1, GSK3\u03b2+CK1\u03b1, or all four kinases. By contrast, CK1\u03b1 inhibition increased phospho-H in wtH- and S493A-cells. Inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 or GSK3\u03b2+CK1\u03b1 depleted phospho-H in wtH-cells. ** P <0.05, * P <0.1; ANOVA. We next examined the consequence of inhibition of the above NF kinases by treatment of cells with pharmacological agents active against each kinase ( Lee et al., 2014 ) on total (GFP-immunoreactive) and phosphorylated (RT97-immunoreactive) levels of each construct ( Fig. 4 ). This yielded results more complex than those observed following kinase upregulation, since previously-phosphorylated NF-H may not be affected by the relatively short-term (4\u2005h) inhibition of kinases as utilized herein. Inhibition of MAPK reduced levels of GFP-wtH and GFP-S493D; S493D was reduced to a greater extent than wtH. Inhibition of cdk5 reduced levels of GFP-S493D but not those of GFP-wtH or GFP-S493A. Inhibition of calpain prevented these reductions, suggesting that they were mediated by calpain. Unexpectedly, simultaneous inhibition of both MAPK and cdk5 prevented reductions observed for GFP-wtH and GFP-S493D following inhibition of either kinase alone, and statistically increased levels of GFP-S493A; the potential role of phospho-mediated changes in tail conformation underlying these findings will be discussed below. Inhibition of CK1\u03b1 reduced levels of GFP-S493D. Inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 reduced levels of GFP-wtH and GFP-S493D. Combined inhibition of GSK3\u03b2+CK1\u03b1 further reduced levels of GFP-wtH. Consistent with prior studies ( Lee et al., 2014 ), inhibition of calpain did not prevent decreases in NF-H following inhibition of GSK3\u03b2\u00b1CK1\u03b1. Simultaneous inhibition of all four kinases reduced GFP-wtH and GFP-S493D, and this reduction was not prevented by inhibition of calpain. Since reduction of constructs following inhibition of MAPK or cdk5 was prevented by inhibition of calpain, these findings suggest that proteolysis induced by separate or simultaneous inhibition of GSK3\u03b2\u00b1CK1\u03b1 may be derived from one or more proteases other than calpain. Levels of RT97-immunoreactivity were also examined ( Fig. 4 ). Inhibition of MAPk decreased levels of RT97-immunoreactive S493D. Unexpectedly, inhibition of cdk5 increased levels of RT97-immunoreactive wtH, S493A and S493D. This increase was attenuated by simultaneous inhibition of MAPk and by inhibition of calpain. In this regard, the kinases involved in NF-H phosphorylation form a complex hierarchy in which inhibition or increase in one NF kinase affects the activity of other kinases and phosphatases ( Lee et al., 2014 ). Levels of all three constructs were unchanged following inhibition of GSK3\u03b2\u00b1Ck1\u03b1 or following simultaneous inhibition of all four constructs. Consistent with increased levels of all three constructs following inhibition of calpain as monitored by GFP, levels of RT97-immunoreactive wtH, S493A and S493D were increased following inhibition of calpain. However, unlike the decreases in GFP levels observed following simultaneous inhibition of calpain and all four kinases, the increases in RT97-immunoreactive wtH, S493A and S493D following inhibition of calpain persisted despite inhibition of all four NF kinases. This is likely due to selective preservation of subunits that had already been phosphorylated and retained their respective phosphates during our short-term inhibition regimen. We next examined the impact of kinase inhibition on subunits already incorporated into the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton ( Fig. 5 ). GFP-S493D levels were significantly reduced following inhibition of MAPk and/or cdk5 and slightly reduced following inhibition of CK1\u03b1. RT97-immunoreactive S493D was reduced following inhibition of all four kinases individually and in combination. Combined inhibition of GSK3\u03b2+CK1\u03b1 decreased RT97-immunoreactive wtH. Consistent with prior studies on NF phosphorylation ( Lee et al., 2014 ), inhibition of calpain did not reduce RT97-immunoreactive levels of any NF-H construct within the Triton-insoluble fraction (not shown). Inhibition of CK1\u03b1 selectively depleted Triton-soluble and -insoluble levels of S493D, but not those of wtH or S493A ( Figs 4 and 5 ). Four CK1\u03b1 consensus sites are located in the proximal portion of the tail, while many more are located within the terminal 187 amino acid residues ( Chen et al., 2000 ). In initial efforts to localize the impact of inhibition of CK1\u03b1 on depletion of S493D, we expressed constructs of wt-H, S493A and S493D in which the terminal 187 amino acids were deleted (wtH\u0394187, S493A\u0394187, and S493D\u0394187), which therefore retained only the proximal CK1\u03b1 consensus sites. Inhibition of CK1\u03b1 reduced Triton-soluble levels of wtH\u0394187 and S493D\u0394187 ( Fig. 6 ); while simultaneous inhibition of CK1\u03b1+calpain prevented the reduction in levels of wtH\u0394187, but did not prevent the reduction in S493D\u0394187. These findings suggest that the increased susceptibility of S493D to proteolysis following CK1\u03b1 inhibition is derived from inhibition of phosphorylation of one or more of the proximal CK1\u03b1 consensus sites. Inhibition of CK1\u03b1 did not statistically alter Triton-insoluble levels of any construct, consistent with the likelihood that NF-H incorporated into the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton had already undergone phosphorylation by this and other NF kinases ( Lee et al., 2014 ).

Panels present nitrocellulose replicas probed with anti-GFP of Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions from cells expressing wt-H\u0394187, S493A\u0394187-cells, and S493D\u0394187 (H, A, D, respectively). The accompanying graphs present quantification of GFP immunoreactivity associated with full-length \u0394187 (mean\u00b1s.e. from three experiments). Levels of soluble wtH\u0394187 and S493D\u0394187 were reduced by addition of D4476; addition of calpain inhibitor prevented depletion of wtH\u0394187 but not S493D\u0394187. Levels of insoluble S493D\u0394187 was reduced following addition of D4476+calpain inhibitor. ** P <0.05, * P <0.1; ANOVA. DISCUSSION Our findings suggest that phosphorylation of S493 induced one or more C-terminal conformational changes since (1) S493D underwent significantly larger increases than did S493A or wt-NF-H following co-expression of NF kinases, and (2) S493D underwent significantly more calpain-mediated proteolysis than S493A or wt-H. Breakdown products for all three constructs were observed at 130-140\u2005kDa and at 100\u2005kDa. S493D displayed an additional fragment migrating at 110-120\u2005kDa. However, only the largest (130-140\u2005kDa) species retained the RT97 epitope. GFP-tagged NF-H in which the terminal 187 amino acids have been deleted migrates at approximately 150\u2005kDa and is reactive with RT97, while the GFP-tagged NF-H rod lacking the entire sidearm migrates at 115-120\u2005kDa and does not react with RT97 ( Lee et al., 2014 ; Lee and Shea, 2014 ). Retention of N-terminally located GFP in all S493D proteolytic fragments, coupled with loss of the C-terminal RT97 epitope in all but the largest (130-140\u2005kDa) fragment, confirmed proteolytic cleavage of C-terminal but not N-terminal regions. Moreover, migration on SDS-gels demonstrates that some of the S493D proteolytic fragments were larger than (130-140\u2005kDa) or as large as (110-120\u2005kDa) the NF-H rod, confirming that multiple cleavage events occurred within the C-terminal tail. The S493D-specific 110-120\u2005kDA fragment was not observed following calpain inhibition. Phosphorylation of S493 therefore likely induces one or more conformational changes that increase accessibility of the NF-H C-terminal tail to NF proteases as well as NF kinases. In this regard, the region surrounding S493 is a so-called \u2018PEST\u2019 motif (a region rich in proline, glutamate, serine and threonine residues). PEST motifs are associated with proteasome and calpain-mediated degradation ( Shumway et al., 1999 ). This may underlie why phosphorylation of S493 and/or the regional CK1\u03b1 consensus sites may be critical in regulation of NF-H levels. Phosphorylation of S493 likely represents an early event in overall NF tail phosphorylation, since (1) S493 is phosphorylated prior to the appearance of immunoreactivity towards monoclonal antibody SMI-31 (which recognizes an early C-terminal phospho-epitope; Sasaki et al., 2002 , 2009 ; S\u00e1nchez et al., 2000 ), and (2) expression of S493D increased NF-H accumulation of phospho-NFs within axonal NFs, corresponding to the normal distribution of extensively phosphorylated NFs. Conversely, expression of S493A fostered perikaryal phospho-NF aggregates, reminiscent of the perikaryal phospho-NF accumulations within perikarya following increased cdk5-mediated NF-H phosphorylation or inhibition of phosphatase activity without upregulation of S493 phosphorylation ( Shea et al., 2004 ; Lee et al., 2014 ; Sasaki et al., 2006 ; Kushkuley et al., 2010 ; Holmgren et al., 2012 ). Perikaryal aggregates sequester motor proteins including kinesin ( Shea and Beaty, 2007 ; Toyoshima et al., 1998 ), which likely underlies the increased levels of kinesin within perikarya of cells expressing S493A as well as increased recovery of S493A by anti-kinesin co-precipitation. The full influence of prevention of phosphorylation of S493 is unclear, since S493A did display downstream phosphorylation as evidenced by the presence of RT97, albeit at reduced levels compared to S493D. Failure to phosphorylate S493 prior to downstream phosphorylation may result in an inappropriate conformation of the tail that favors precocious NF-NF associations. This represents an instance where mutagenesis to prevent phosphorylation at a particular site does not provide the physiological opposite to pseudo-phosphorylation. These results also indicate that increased levels of S493D within the axonal cytoskeleton were not due to an increased propensity to associate with kinesin, but rather due to an increased ability to form NF-NF associations within axonal neurites ( Lee et al., 2014 ; Pant, 1988 ; Goldstein et al., 1987 ; Greenwood et al., 1993 ). Proline-peptidyl isomerase 1 (PIN1) alters the configuration of the NF-H tail to allow extensive phosphorylation. Proline residues can exist as cis or trans isomers, with cis isomerization fostering a regional fold or curve in the peptide and trans isomerization fostering a more extended conformation ( Weiwad et al., 2004 ). PIN1 disrupts the bond that can form between phosphorylated serine or threonine residues and an immediately adjacent proline in a cis form, and fosters a switch of that proline to the more stable trans isomer ( Lu and Zhou, 2007 ). Notably, proline-directed kinases, including MAPk and cdk5, cannot phosphorylate serines or threonines that are cis -bonded to adjacent proline residues ( Weiwad et al., 2004 ). However, as NF-H C-terminal phosphorylation proceeds, trans isomerization by PIN-1 fosters progressive sidearm extension and renders additional phosphorylation sites accessible to kinases ( Kesavapany et al., 2007 ; Rudrabhatla et al., 2008 , 2009 ). In efforts to understand how phosphorylation of S493 might participate in conformational changes, we scrutinized the amino acid sequence of the rat NF-H C-terminal tail (since our construct contained the rat sequence). We noted that S493 was immediately followed by a proline residue ( Fig. 7 A). While it is clear that PIN1 can expose MAPk and cdk5 sites for phosphorylation, initial phosphorylation of a serine adjacent to a proline must occur to generate the phosphoserine-proline bond recognized by PIN1 ( Kesavapany et al., 2007 ; Rudrabhatla et al., 2008 , 2009 ; Weiwad et al., 2004 ). Phosphorylation of S493, which is part of a GSK3B consensus sequence rather than a proline-directed consensus site, could represent this initiating phosphorylation event. Notably, S501, which is also immediately followed by a proline residue, is part of an additional GSK3b consensus site in the proximal portion of the NF-H tail ( Fig. 7 A). Phosphorylation of S501, perhaps along with that of S493, may also serve as an initiating event for the action of PIN1 on the NF-H tail and promotion of downstream MAPk/cdk5 phosphorylation events. Download powerpoint Fig. 7. Proposed model for role of S493 and subsequent phosphorylation events in NF tail configuration. (A) Amino acid sequence of the rat NF-H C-terminal tail. Consensus sequences for GSK3b are red, those for MAPk are gray, those for cdk5 are blue, and those for CK1a are underscored; note that some GSK3b and CK1a consensus sequences overlap. Found double proline (PP) motifs (indicated in green) are nested within domains consisting of multiple consensus sequences for each of these kinase: the first PP is nested within in the proximal GSK-3b/CK1a domain, the second is within the MAPk domain, the third is within the cdk5 domain, and fourth is within the distal GSK-3b/CK1a domain. S493 is the serine immediately before the first PP motif. (B) Schematic of \u2018closed\u2019 and \u2018open\u2019 configuration of a peptide resulting from cis-cis and trans-trans configurations of a double proline motif. (C) Hypothetical closed and open configurations of NF-H. The regions containing consensus sequences for GSK3b/CK1a, MAPk, cdk5 and the proximal GSK3b/CK1a domain S493 (since it is part of a GSK3b consensus sequence) are indicated in red, gray, blue and red, respectively, in all images. With all double-prolines (PP) in cis-cis configuration, the non-phosphorylated tail could fold or curve back upon itself. Ionic attractions and/or salt bridges could form between opposing regions of the tail. Repulsive forces resulting from regional phosphorylation (indicated by yellow stars) could convert double-prolines to trans-trans configurations and foster tail extension into an open configuration. (D) Phosphorylation of S493 is hypothesized to convert the adjacent double-proline to a trans-trans configuration and initiate phospho-dependent tail extension. Extension would increase susceptibility to calpain-mediated proteolysis (indicated by scissors) under conditions where only MAPK or cdk5 were active. Conversely, if neither MAPK of cdk5 were active, their nested double-prolines would remain in cis-cis configuration and proteolysis would not occur. (E) Phospho-dependent conversion of the tail to an open configuration and formation of phospho-dependent NF-NF associations. Double arrows depict the hypothesized reversible opening and closing of portions of the tail, resulting from phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of MAPk and cdk5 consensus sequences, coupled with conversion of their nested double-proline motifs between trans-trans and cis-cis configurations. This regional closure may allow for continued NF-NF association despite closer apposition within the reduced caliber in the nodes of Ranvier. S493 is immediately followed by not one but two proline residues ( Fig. 7 A). So-called \u2018double-proline motifs\u2019 provide a hinge-like structure that dictates regional conformation, encompassing fully \u2018closed/folded\u2019 cis-cis conformations, fully \u2018open/extended\u2019 trans-trans conformations, and \u2018medial\u2019 cis-trans and trans-cis conformations. All of these, like the conformation of individual prolines, are strongly influenced by the adjacent amino acid residues ( Fig. 7 B) ( MacArthur and Thornton, 1991 ). We also noted three additional double-proline motifs within the rat tail domain: the first of which was located within the region containing the consensus sequences for MAPk, the second of which was located within the region containing the consensus sequences for cdk5, and the last of which was located within the region containing the consensus sequences for CK1 and GSK3b ( Fig. 7 C). Prior to C-terminal phosphorylation, these double-proline motifs could rotate to assume a cis-cis conformation, perhaps strengthened by attractive forces among positively and negatively charged regions in overlapping segments of the tail, resulting in a series of \u2018accordion-like\u2019 folds or curvatures around the double-proline motifs. C-terminal extension could then be mediated by rotation of the respective double-proline to a trans-trans configuration following regional phosphorylation by each respective kinase ( Fig. 7 C). Notably, this model provides a possible explanation for the unanticipated observation that, while inhibition of either MAPk or cdk5 resulted in proteolysis of the NF-H C-terminal region of S493D, simultaneous inhibition of both MAPk and cdk5 does not result in calpain-mediated proteolysis. Phosphorylation by MAPk would foster a trans-trans configuration of the double-proline motif nested within its consensus sequences, and this would expose a portion of the domain rich in cdk5 sequences ( Fig. 7 D). Prevention of cdk5-mediated phosphorylation under these conditions would therefore result in calpain-mediated proteolysis, as observed. A similar situation would result following phosphorylation by cdk5 coupled with prevention of phosphorylation by MAPk. The double-proline motif nested within the cdk5 sequences would assume a trans-trans configuration, exposing the domain rich in MAPk sequences to calpain-mediated proteolysis. Conversely, inhibition of both MAPk and cdk5 would allow their respective nested double-proline motifs to remain in cis-cis configurations, which could potentially shield this region from proteolysis, as observed herein. This \u2018closed\u2019 conformation could underlie how NFs lacking KSP phosphorylation can undergo transport into and along axons without proteolytic degradation. This line of reasoning also accommodates the absence of KSP phosphorylation within the nodes of Ranvier ( Hsieh et al., 1994 ) without proteolytic depletion of NFs. In the absence of MAPk and cdk5-mediated KSP phosphorylation, the second and third double-proline motifs could assume (or retain) cis-cis conformations. This is not to suggest that phosphorylation of NFs regulate axonal caliber, but rather that such an \u2018intermediary\u2019 sidearm conformation could allow the closer NF-NF spacing observed within the nodes of Ranvier, while protecting NFs from proteolysis. Moreover, any phospho-mediated NF-NF interactions within the nodes could be maintained despite closer apposition of NFs via continued trans-trans configuration of the first and fourth double-proline motifs, which are flanked by GSK3\u03b2 and CK1\u03b1 consensus sites ( Fig. 7 E). Notably, Sasaki and colleagues reported persistence of S493 phosphorylation within the nodes of Ranvier despite lack of KSP phosphorylation ( Sasaki et al., 2009 ). In support of the model suggested herein, a GSK3\u03b2 consensus sequence analogous to S493 is present in the proximal region of the murine and human NF-H C-terminus ( Fig. S1 ) ( Chin and Liem, 1990 ; Julien et al., 1986 ; Lees et al., 1988 ; Robinson et al., 1986 ). The first double-proline in the murine and human NF-H is also located at the start of the sidearm, prior to the first KSP sequence, while the additional double-proline motifs are nested within tail regions rich in KSP sequences and the terminal region rich in GSK3\u03b2/Ck1\u03b1 consensus sequences ( Fig. S1 ). We did not scrutinize the entire tail sequence of all mammals, but of the 92 mammals for which the NF-H sequence is available, 74% displayed a double-proline motif between the proximal E segment (containing GSK3b and/or CK1a consensus sequences) and before the initial KSP-consensus sequence, and all but three of these were immediately preceded by an S or T as part of a CK1a consensus sequence ( Table S1 ). The model proposed herein is also consistent with the proposed behavior of the NF-H tail domain prior to and following phosphorylation as determined by atomic force microscopy and computer analyses ( Brown and Hoh, 1997 ; Malka-Gibor et al., 2017 ; Zhulina and Leermakers, 2007 , 2009 ), with the exception that our model encompasses the possibility of a more ordered conformation of the tail prior to phosphorylation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and transfection Mouse neuroblastoma cells (NB2a/d1) were utilized due to their ease of culture and ability to replicate rapidly while still modeling the dynamics of an axon. NB2a/d1 cells express and phosphorylate all three NF subunits ( Shea et al., 1988 ), and exhibit establishment of Triton-insoluble NFs resembling that observed in axons in situ ( Shaw and Hou, 1990 ). Culture reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Natick, MA) unless otherwise indicated. Cells were propagated on either plastic tissue culture dishes or glass coverslips coated with laminin and poly-D-lysine and were maintained in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals: Flowery Branch, GA, USA) with antibiotics. Axonal neurite outgrowth was induced by addition of 1\u2005mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) for 3\u2005days ( Shea et al., 1988 ; Yabe et al., 1999 ). Cells were transiently transfected 24\u2005h after plating using Polyjet (PJ) transfection reagent (SignaGen: Rockville, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 4\u2005\u00b5g total of plasmids (listed below). Cells were incubated with the transfection complex for 4\u2005h after which culture medium was replaced with fresh medium lacking the transfection complex but containing dbcAMP. Cells were transfected with one of three forms of a construct containing the DNA sequence for Rattus norvegicus NF-H tagged on the N-terminus with GFP ( Lee et al., 2014 ): a plasmid containing wild-type NF-H (wtH), a plasmid expressing this sequence in which serine 493 was replaced with alanine (S493A) in order to mimic constitutive non-phosphorylation, and a plasmid in which S493 was replaced with aspartic acid (S493D) in order to mimic constitutive phosphorylation. S493A and S493D constructs were prepared from the GFP-tagged NF-H construct using the QuickChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies: Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification was used to introduce the S493A and S493D mutations using the following primers: 5\u2032GAAGCAGCAACTACGGCT TG-CAGAAG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CTTCTGCA AGCCGTAGTTGCTGCTT C-3\u2032 (reverse) for generation of the S493A mutation and 5\u2032-GAGAAGAAGCAGCAACTACGTGA TGCAGA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TCTGCA TCACGTAGTTGCTGCTTCT TCT C-3\u2032 (reverse) for generation of the S493D mutation. Additional cells were transfected with truncated versions of each full-length NF-H construct described above, in which the last 187 amino acids of the protein were removed by insertion of an artificial stop codon as described ( Lee et al., 2014 ). This removed the majority of the GSK3\u03b2 and CK1\u03b1 consensus sequences (which are located within the terminal 187 amino acids), and retained only two GSK3\u03b2 consensus sequences (including the GSK3\u03b2 consensus site at S493 and at S501) and four proximally located CK1\u03b1 consensus sites. These constructs are termed wtH\u0394187, S493A\u0394187 and S493D\u0394187, respectively. For cells intended for use in immunocytochemical and immunoprecipitation experiments (described below), each construct was co-transfected with a plasmid that expressed a shRNA targeting an untranslated region (UTR) at the 5\u2032 end of the endogenous Mus musculus NF-H RNA transcript. Only NF-H RNA transcripts expressed by the Nb2a/d1 cells contain UTR sequences, allowing for selective transient knockdown of endogenous NF-H ( Lee and Shea, 2014 ). Prior studies demonstrated that exogenous GFP-tagged NF-H was expressed at levels equivalent to that of endogenous NF-H ( Lee and Shea, 2014 ; co-transfection with this shRNA therefore allowed replacement of endogenous NF-H with appropriate levels of exogenous WT NF-H, S493A, or S493D). shRNA co-transfections were performed with more than three times shRNA construct than that of NF-H construct (3\u2005\u00b5g shRNA construct/1\u2005\u00b5g NF-H construct) to increase the likelihood that cells displaying GFP had also internalized shRNA. Manipulation of NF kinases Kinase inhibition and overexpression were utilized to elucidate the effects of S493 phosphorylation on downstream NF-H C-terminal tail domain phosphorylation. wtH-cells, S493A-cells, and S493D-cells were treated with the following pharmacological kinase inhibitors singularly or in combination for 4\u2005h prior to harvest on day 3 of differentiation: 10\u2005\u00b5M PD98059, 20\u2005\u00b5M Roscovitine, 100\u2005\u00b5M D4476, and/or 10\u2005mM Li + which are active against mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MKK1), cdk5, CK1, and GSK3\u03b2 respectively ( Dudley et al., 1995 ; Meijer et al., 1997 ; Cheng and Louis, 1999 ; Rena et al., 2004 ). These pharmacological agents will be referred to as inhibitors of their target kinases as listed above for simplicity of writing only, with the recognition that they may exert off-target effects, although prior studies from this laboratory have confirmed their relative specificity ( Lee et al., 2014 ; Chan et al., 2004 ; Shea et al., 2004 ). Additional cultures were subjected to co-transfection with the above NF-H constructs and constructs expressing constitutively-active MAPKK (functional as an upstream MAPK pathway activator) ( Li et al., 1999 ), murine p35 (activator of cdk5; Patrick et al., 1999 ; generous gift of Harish Pant, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) murine CK1\u03b1 (Origene: Rockville, MD, USA), or constitutively-active murine GSK3\u03b2 (\u2018GSK3\u03b2 ALA\u2019; generous gift from Chris Miller, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, UK; Lee et al., 2014 ). Co-transfected cultures were incubated with 2\u2005\u00b5g of each plasmid (to maintain a total of 4\u2005\u00b5g and avoid toxicity). The kinases and activators used within these cells, the plasmids used for expression, and activity following expression using independent activity assays have been well-documented and were therefore not included herein (see Lee et al., 2014 and references therein). Additional cultures also received 10\u2005\u00b5M calpain inhibitor III (active against calpain I and II; Jourdi et al., 2009 ). Calpain inhibitor was added to the culture medium on day 3 of differentiation and any kinase inhibitor was added following 1\u2005h incubation with calpain inhibitor alone. Cells were incubated for an additional 4\u2005h before harvesting. Cell harvesting Cells were harvested after 3\u2005days of differentiation for SDS-PAGE analysis using established methods with minor modifications ( Yabe et al., 2001 ). Cultures were scraped on ice in 50\u2005mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 1% Triton X-100, 5\u2005mM EDTA, 1\u2005mM PMSF, a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA), and PhosStop (Roche Diagnostics). After scraping, 250 units Dnase1 (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:2 in DNase Activating Buffer [10\u2005mM Tris (pH 7.5), containing 0.25\u2005mM MgCl 2 and 0.5\u2005mM CaCl 2 ] was added, lysates were incubated (30\u2005min on ice), homogenized on ice with a loose-fitting Teflon pestle in a borosilicate glass homogenizer (Thomas Scientific: Swedesboro, NJ, USA) and centrifuged (15,000\u2005\u00d7 g for 15\u2005min at 4\u00b0C). The resultant (Triton-soluble) supernatants were decanted and (Triton-insoluble) sedimented material was resuspended in the same buffer containing 8\u2005M Urea. Samples were normalized according to protein concentration as determined by Pierce BCA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and diluted in 187.5\u2005mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 6% (w/v) SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) bromophenol blue, and 2% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol for SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis Triton-soluble fractions were made 1% SDS and diluted 1:5 (vol/vol) in 60\u2005mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 190\u2005mM NaCl, 6\u2005mM EDTA, 1.25% Triton X-100, 1\u2005mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail and PhosStop ( Shea et al., 1990 ). Fractions were normalized with respect to protein concentration by Pierce BCA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and aliquoted into micro-centrifuge tubes, such that each tube contained an equal volume of lysate and 400\u2005\u00b5g of total protein. Protein G-conjugated magnetic beads (25\u2005\u00b5l; New England Biolabs: Ipswich, MA, USA) were added to each lysate followed by incubation with orbital agitation for 1\u2005h at 4\u00b0C. A magnet was used to precipitate the beads (defined as the pre-precipitate) and the supernatants were transferred to a new tube. Each supernatant received 1:100 dilutions of one of the following antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against ubiquitous kinesin heavy chain (UKHC) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), an antibody directed against dynein (clone 70.1; Sigma-Aldrich), a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against GFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following incubation with orbital agitation at 4\u00b0C overnight, protein G-conjugated beads (25\u2005\u00b5l) were added to each tube, followed by subsequent incubation with orbital agitation for 1\u2005h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were precipitated as above, and the supernatant (defined at the post-precipitate) was transferred to a new tube. Each pellet (defined as the precipitate) was washed three times by resuspension in 50\u2005mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150\u2005mM NaCl, 5\u2005mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% SDS with sedimentation between each wash. Samples of each fraction (total lysate, pre-precipitate, precipitate, and post-precipitate) were diluted 1:5 in 187.5\u2005mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) bromophenol blue, and 2% BME for SDS-PAGE. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE with 4-15% polyacrylamide Tris-Glycine gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), and transferred for 1\u2005h to nitrocellulose membranes ( Lee and Shea, 2014 ). The resulting nitrocellulose replicas were blocked in 5% goat serum-1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-Buffered Saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) with reciprocal shaking for 1\u2005h at room temperature, followed by incubation overnight with one of the following antibodies: a 1:1000 dilution of a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Applied Biological Materials, New York City, NY, USA), a 1:500 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against all NF subunits regardless of phosphorylation state (R39; Jung and Shea, 1999 ), or a 1:100 dilution of a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against a developmentally-delayed NF-H phospho-epitope (RT97, generous gift of Dr B. Anderton, Institute on Psychiatry, King's College, London, UK; Veeranna et al., 2008 ). Immunoreactive species were detected with a 1:10,000 dilution of the appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma Aldrich) and BCIP/NBT substrate (BioRad). All samples intended for analytical comparison were either run on the same gel, or, in the case of large sample sets, on multiple gels that were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized simultaneously, under identical conditions. Quantification of immunoreactive species was carried out using ImageJ (NIH) software of scanned images of processed nitrocellulose replicas. An average background signal of equivalent area was quantified in two adjacent regions within the same lane and subtracted from quantification of each immunoreactive species ( Yabe et al., 2001 ). GFP-tagged NF-H migrates as multiple phospho-isoforms from 200-260\u2005kDa on SDS gels (e.g. Lee et al., 2014 ); breakdown products were not included in quantification. R39-immunoreactive species corresponding to the molecular weight of endogenous NF-H (160-200\u2005kDa), but not NF-M (145-160\u2005kDa) or NF-L (70\u2005kDa), were included in analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with Fisher's post hoc analyses (StatPlus Software). Comparisons with ** P <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant; comparison with * P <0.1 but >0.05 were considered to represent a trend towards significance. For presentation, lines within a single treatment condition indicate which columns are being compared; in instances where no connecting lines are present, asterisk(s) indicate comparison of that condition versus the corresponding untreated control condition. Immunocytochemistry Cells were cultured on laminin and poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips and co-transfected with shRNA directed against NF-H and constructs expressing wt-H, S493A, or S493D as described above ( Lee et al., 2014 ). Cultures were washed briefly with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and fixed for 15\u2005min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cultures were then washed three times with PBS (5\u2005min/wash) and blocked in 10% goat serum in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1\u2005h at room temperature. Cultures were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a 1:100 dilution of RT97 in 2% goat serum in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cultures were washed three times with PBS (5\u2005min/wash) and then incubated for 1\u2005h at room temperature in rhodamine red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500) in 2% goat serum-PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cultures were washed three times with PBS (5\u2005min/wash). Water was removed from the cultures by sequential rinses in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations (70, 80, 95, 100%). Coverslips were then rinsed twice in xylene and mounted on glass slides using the non-aqueous mounting medium DePeX, and allowed to dry overnight. Fluorescent intensity was quantified within axonal neurites and soma. RT97 immunoreactivity within perikarya versus axonal neurites were compared as an index of NF phosphorylation level and relative distribution of phospho-H. The percentage of cells containing perikaryal GFP and phospho-H aggregates was also quantified. Cells containing non-diffuse tanged/aggregated immunoreactivity within \u226550% of their perikarya were scored as \u2018possessing aggregates\u2019 or \u2018aggregated\u2019. Kinesin immunoreactivity was compared as an index of distribution of this motor protein within perikarya and neurites by calculating a ratio of somal/neurite densitometric levels in cells displaying GFP (as confirmation of expression of respective constructs). In efforts to approximate the consequence of expression of NF construct on differential distribution of kinesin immunoreactivity, we also quantified this ratio for cells within cultures transfected with S493D but expressing no detectable GFP signal. These cells were considered to represent the distribution of kinesin in the absence of detectable expression of NF constructs, and in additional analyses this ratio was subtracted from the ratio of all values of transfected cells. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with Fisher's post hoc analysis (StatPlus Software). Footnotes The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

Reduced elastic modulus as a function of displacement during nanoindentation. (A) Slow strain rate only, comparing the two regions. (B) Fast strain rate only, comparing the two regions. (C) Tarsal subsegment 3 (ts3) only, comparing the two strain rates. (D) Membrane with microtrichia only, comparing the two strain rates. Each marker indicates the mean\u00b12\u2005s.e.m. for both y and x . Sample sizes: for slow strain rates, n =8 for indents in tarsal subsegments, n =7 for indents in membrane with microtrichia; for fast strain rates, n =7 for indents in tarsal subsegments, n =6 for indents in membrane with microtrichia. Red indicates the membrane with microtrichia, blue indicates the tarsal subsegments. The elastic modulus, E cuticle , can be calculated from the reduced elastic modulus, E r (Eqn 10), if the Poisson's ratio for cuticle is known, in addition to the material properties of the nanoindenter probe tip. The probe tip is made of diamond. The relevant properties for diamond are v diamond =0.07 (dimensionless) and E diamond =1143\u2005GPa ( Klein, 1992 ). The Poisson's ratio for insect cuticle has been reported as varying between 0.02 and 0.1 [in the plane of the cuticle, locust intersegmental membrane cuticle on the ovipositor of adult female locusts ( Vincent, 1990 ); different numbers graphed in fig. 4.12 of the same reference are assumed to be in error]. Substituting in these values for diamond and cuticle into Eqn 10, it is clear that the term for the indenter is negligible, leaving the simplified relationship: (1) If the Poisson's ratio for the bed bug cuticle is \u22640.1, this would mean that E cuticle would be within 1% of E r (Eqn 1), and therefore is a close approximation. The reduced elastic modulus is often reported because of the lack of information on the Poisson's ratio for insect cuticle ( Muller et al., 2008 ). DISCUSSION As an insect or other arthropod walks, its tarsi and pretarsi, which are in contact with the surface, are potentially vulnerable to damage or entrapment. For example, aphids and leafhoppers moving on the surface of a bean plant are entrapped by hook-like trichomes which pierce the tarsi or pretarsi and hinder their mobility ( Johnson, 1953 ). We have identified the magnitude of the force required to indent the cuticle in various regions of bed bug tarsi and pretarsi at various depths by a sharp probe. The magnitude of the force to indent one micron into the cuticle was approximately 0.5\u2005mN (averaging over all regions and strain rates). A larger force is required to indent farther into the cuticle for all regions. The region of the pretarsus that is typically pierced, the membrane with microtrichia, differed in several respects from the other areas of cuticle on the tarsus, but only for the first micron of indentation. The membrane with microtrichia was easier to indent (about 20-30% less force for a depth of 1 micron, Fig. 2 ), displayed more creep ( Fig. 4 ), and had a lower reduced elastic modulus (slow strain rates only, Fig. 8 ) than the tarsal subsegments ( Fig. 8 ). For deeper indentations (>1 micron), these differences between regions either disappeared or reversed ( Figs 3 , 4 and 8 ). The significance of these differences for shallow indents may lie in facilitating the start of a puncture by a sharp trichome. In addition, the membrane with microtrichia behaves differently from the other regions tested. When visualized in low vacuum SEM while probing with the sharp nanomanipulator, the membrane with microtrichia did not form the characteristic indentation shape (dent) as seen in other areas of the cuticle, but simply rebounded without visible damage to a depth of up to 5 microns when the nanomanipulator probe was retracted. All of these mechanical attributes, in addition to the presence of the natural infoldings in the cuticle of this area, may make the membrane with microtrichia area of the pretarsus particularly vulnerable to piercing. A larger force is needed to indent farther into the cuticle ( Fig. 3 ). Therefore, it might be expected that a larger force would be required to puncture thicker cuticle. The cuticle thickness was highly variable for all areas examined, although the variability showed a different pattern for the different regions. For the pretarsal region (pretarsal claws and membrane with microtrichia), when the cut surface of the cuticle was examined after milling, the cuticle thickness varied on a single specimen over a distance of a few microns because of the channels that infiltrated the pretarsus in a complex manner (measuring cuticle thickness from the outside to a channel, Fig. 7 B). The piercing by trichomes was usually close to the boundary between the membrane with microtrichia and a pretarsal claw, and the cuticle was often observed to be particularly thin at this boundary area; although the abrupt changes of cuticle thickness in any direction made it challenging to measure consistently. In addition, the infolding of the cuticle at that boundary could help to secure the tip of a sharp trichome, analogous to a \u2018starter hole\u2019 guiding a hammered nail. A more thorough three-dimensional analysis of the cuticle of the pretarsal region would be needed to provide a systematic and comprehensive description of its complex geometry. Cuticle thickness was less variable on a single specimen for an individual tarsal subsegment. For the tarsal subsegments most of the varability in cuticle thickness was seen between individuals, not within a single tarsal segment, in which the cuticle thickness did not vary appreciably over tens of microns ( Fig. 7 A). Although force data were recorded to a probe movement of 9 microns, whether or not a sharp object will penetrate and possibly ultimately pierce the cuticle may be largely determined by the mechanical interaction that occurs in the first few microns. The thickness of the cuticle might have a complex relationship with the force needed to pierce it. For example, an area with thin cuticle might be more likely to simply bend macroscopically and deform without being pierced, while an area with thicker cuticle might be less likely to bend and therefore be more likely to be pierced. That is, stiff structures are easier to break than deformable ones ( Vogel, 1986 ). The boundary between the membrane with microtrichia and the pretarsal claw has a complex geometry that might explain why this area is particularly vulnerable to piercing: the boundary is composed of a particularly thin area of cuticle surrounded by thicker areas of cuticle. Thus, in addition to the infolding that might help to secure a sharp point, the thinner area of cuticle might be \u2018held in place\u2019 by the surrounding thicker cuticle and therefore unable to simply deform out of the way, and being thinner, is easier to pierce. We did not observe an abrupt discontinuity, or sudden change in the force recording, as the sharp indenter probe completely penetrated the cuticle. Therefore, we are unable to identify the exact displacement at which the cuticle was pierced completely by the probe, even though the cuticle would eventually become punctured with sufficient depth. We know that the cuticle was usually pierced after a 10 micron displacement for both the tarsal subsegments and the membrane with microtrichia, because we were able to visualize the holes during later examination of the same bugs in LV-SEM. The deformations that we generated with our sharp probe were localized to the immediate area of the sharp probe. The nanoindenter probe tip that we used has a shape of a cube corner with a sharp tip, and shares that important similarity with real trichomes which have a sharp but conical tip (round in cross-section). The nanomanipulator probe tip was not as sharp as the nanoindenter tip, and had a slightly different shape of a rectangular cross-section, but also made a triangular indent into the cuticle surface. The time-dependent properties of cuticle suggest that more force would be required to pierce the tarsi if the tarsi were moved more quickly during locomotion. Insects (including bed bugs) tend to cycle their legs through tripodal movements at a high frequency (bed bugs cycle through all six legs at \u223c8 times/sec; Szyndler et al., 2013 ), which means that their tarsi are being impaled within a fraction of second. This is even faster than our fastest experimental strain rate, but we were constrained by machine capabilities. Evidently bed bugs are generating sufficient force when moving their feet to self-impale, but this force has not yet been measured. We know of no documented cases in which insects move particularly slowly when around trichomes, although careful placement of tarsi to avoid trichomes has been documented in other insects walking on plant surfaces ( Voigt et al., 2007 ; Voigt and Gorb, 2010 ). In other piercing contexts, it suggests that piercing of cuticle by ovipositors of parasitoid wasps or piercing of cuticle by the aedeagus during traumatic insemination in bed bugs could require less force if the piercing structure is moved more slowly. Mechanical creep reduces the force necessary to pierce an object because a sharp object pressed into the cuticle will continue to sink into the cuticle. The time course of mechanical creep of insect cuticle can be very long: the cuticle of fifth instar Rhodnius bugs was still exhibiting creep 8\u2005h after a constant load was applied ( Reynolds, 1975 ). The original application for nanoindentation was to test homogenous, flat materials such as thin films and crystalline structures ( Oliver and Pharr, 1992 ). Bed bug cuticle on live, restrained whole bed bugs is neither homogenous nor flat. Therefore, the estimates of material properties of the cuticle, such as the elastic modulus, would be expected to show variability, which was observed. However, even with this variability (also documented by Sample et al., 2015 , for insect wing cuticle), clear differences in mechanical properties of the different parts of the tarsus and pretarsus were documented for the small indents of 1 micron. In addition, the forces measured using the sharp nanoindenter tip (\u2018cube corner\u2019 geometry) may be used to estimate the forces that would be required for a plant trichome to pierce the cuticle. The identification of the forces required to pierce bed bug cuticle and the mechanical properties of the cuticle should help to inform development of synthetic materials intended to functionally mimic the bed bug entrapping capabilities of leaves from bean plants. In addition, this mechanical characterization will help us understand the coevolutionary arms race between trichome-armed plants and insects. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental insects and plants All bed bugs used in experiments were adult males ( Cimex lectularius ). Bugs were of the \u2018Fort Dixon\u2019 strain and were supplied by Dr K. Haynes of the University of Kentucky, USA. Bugs were not fed after eclosion to adults. Measurements were made on bugs 6\u2013154\u2005days after adult eclosion (mode was 18\u2005days, mean was 53\u2005days). Kidney bean plants ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) were grown in the University of California, Irvine, USA greenhouse from seed (Johnny's Seeds, Winslow, ME, USA; Product 2554). Individual leaves used for bed bug entrapment were trifoliate and node \u22651 because these are the leaves that are most effective in capturing bed bugs ( Szyndler et al., 2013 ). All leaves used were <90\u2005mm in length (from tip of leaf to petiole attachment). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging Low-vacuum scanning electron microscope (LV-SEM) imaging was performed on a Quanta 3D FEG Dual Beam SEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 0.6\u2005mbar and 5\u2005kV. Bed bugs examined in LV-SEM were glued onto SEM stubs with an acrylic mounting system (VariDur high performance mounting system; Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) to restrict their movement. Bugs were alive during and after imaging and exposure to the vacuum. Determining specific locations of piercing Leaves were removed from the plants, and placed with their abaxial side (undersurface) facing upward. Bed bugs ( n =10) were placed individually on the leaves and were allowed to walk until they became entrapped by the hook-like trichomes on the leaves. These pierced bed bugs were removed from these leaves and placed dorsal surface down on carbon tape on SEM stubs. The bug tarsi were viewed in LV-SEM and examined for evidence of piercing by bean plant trichomes. Anatomy of tarsal subsegments In order to evaluate gross differences in morphology in the different legs, lengths and widths (diameters) of tarsal subsegments were measured from scanning electron micrographs using Canvas 15 (ACD Systems, Seattle, WA, USA) (see Fig. 1 B,C,D) for 23 bugs. LV-SEM images were used to determine the length and width of the tarsal subsegments for the six different legs ( n =120 legs from 23 different bugs; 1-6 legs were used per bug; 3 bugs had all 6 legs measured). Nanoindentation For nanoindentation, live bed bugs were mounted on SEM stubs with an acrylic mounting system as described above. Live bugs were mounted on their backs, with their dorsal surface in contact with the SEM stub so that the ventral side of the bug was accessible. The tarsi, abdomen, thorax, and head were all firmly fixed in place to minimize movement during experimentation, leaving parts of the tarsi and pretarsi exposed for nanoindentation. Bugs were still alive after nanoindentation. If there was any evidence of tarsal movement, those data were not used. A total of 123 indents on 67 different legs of 47 different bugs were analyzed. After nanoindentation, bugs were moved to the scanning electron microscope to visualize the indents using LV-SEM as described above ( Fig. 5 ). Mechanical testing was performed with an Agilent G200 nanoindenter (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with a diamond cube-corner tip with testing performed in DCM mode at room temperature. The cube-corner probe exhibits the geometry of the corner of a cube, allowing for a relatively sharp tip that when pressed into the surface makes a characteristic three-sided indent ( Fig. 5 ). For a cube corner (\u2018trirectangular tetrahedron\u2019), the relationship between the area of the triangular base ( A b ) (the projected equilateral triangle viewed in Fig. 5 A) and the altitude of the tetrahedron (the depth of indentation, D ) is: (2) and the relationship between the projected length of any of the three \u2018legs\u2019 (\u03b1, seen in Fig. 5 B) and the depth of indentation is: (3) Four different indentation strain rates were used: 0.003, 0.005, 0.02, and 0.5\u2005s \u22121 . These are \u2018true\u2019 strain rates (instantaneous rates of increase in length), not \u2018engineering\u2019 strain rates (rates of increase in length compared to starting length) ( Lucas and Oliver, 1999 ; Vogel, 2013 ). Strain rates, \u025b\u02d9 i , were evaluated directly from the raw displacement and time data by dividing the instantaneous rate of displacement by the average displacement during that same time period: (4) where h i is the displacement corresponding to time t i (therefore, \u025b\u02d9 i is a forward estimate). The instrument was used in strain rate controlled mode, with force and displacement recorded continuously. In order to uncover any inhomogeneous material properties as a function of tip displacement, some of the indentation experiments were performed with cycling. For each cycling test the probe penetrated in micron increments, pausing with a constant force at each depth for a set hold time (60\u2005s for a 0.005\u2005s \u22121 strain rate and 5\u2005s for a 0.5\u2005s \u22121 strain rate) in order to observe any time-dependent material response. Creep was measured as the continued displacement into the cuticle during the force hold for the set time period. Creep during the hold time is clearly taking place, as can be seen in Fig. 5 . Mechanical properties were calculated from unloading segments performed after each holding segment before continuing to the next depth. Unloading consisted of retracting the probe to 10% of its peak load value while still maintaining contact with the surface. Reduced elastic modulus was calculated from the nanoindenter output using the Oliver-Pharr method ( Oliver and Pharr, 1992 ) with the recommended adjustments for viscoelastic materials such as polymers ( Kinney et al., 2003 ; Ngan et al., 2005 ) due to the creep strain that was observed. The average displacement rate during hold time, , is: (5) where the \u2018total creep\u2019 during the hold time is \u0394 x between points 1 and 2 in Fig. 5 B, and the time of creep is 5\u2005s for the fast strain rate (0.5\u2005s \u22121 ) and 60\u2005s for the slow strain rate (0.005\u2005s \u22121 ). A longer time for creep was provided for the slower strain rates to make the total creep more similar between the different strain rates (the rate of creep during the hold time was slower for the slower strain rates). The average unloading rate during the first 90% of unloading, , was calculated by: (6) where P u is the force at the beginning of unloading (the y value of point 2 on Fig. 5 B) and t 0.9, unloading is the time difference from the beginning of unloading until the load has reached 10% of its initial unloading value (the time difference between points 2 and 3). This approach is comparable to Kinney et al. (2003) , who estimated from the midpoint of the unloading curve (force versus time). The rate of change of force during unloading is fairly linear ( Fig. 5 C), and therefore Eqn 6 should provide similar results to the approach in Kinney et al. (2003) . The apparent stiffness, S , is output by the nanoindenter software, and is the slope of the linear fit to the initial 50% of the unloading region of the curve. The creep-corrected contact stiffness, S e , is calculated as ( Ngan et al., 2005 ): (7) The reduced elastic modulus, E r , is calculated as: (8) where A c is the \u2018contact area\u2019 (projected area, as viewed in Fig. 5 ). A c is calculated from the basic geometry of a tetrahedron (Eqn 2) substituting h c in for the altitude, D , where the contact depth, h c , is calculated as: (9) where h max is the maximal displacement during the cycle ( x value of point 2 in Fig. 5 B) and \u03b5 is a number dependent on probe tip geometry, which is 0.75 for \u2018conical\u2019 indenter tip shapes (i.e. both cube corner and Berkovich tip shapes; Oliver and Pharr, 1992 ; Pharr, 1998 ). Calculation of the elastic modulus, E cuticle , from the reduced elastic modulus, E r , requires knowing the Poisson's ratio, \u03bd , for the cuticle and the indenter, as well as the elastic modulus of the indenter tip E indenter ( Oliver and Pharr, 1992 ): (10) Visualization of cuticle deformation with a nanomanipulator A nanomanipulator (Omniprobe 200, Oxford Instruments, Oxford, UK) was used while bugs were in being viewed in LV-SEM (FEI Quanta 3D FEG Dual Beam SEM) to visualize the events that occur when deforming bed bug cuticle with a sharp probe (such as during nanoindentation, which cannot be observed directly). To facilitate comparison with the nanoindenter data, the nanomanipulator deformations were also made on the third tarsal subsegment and two regions of the pretarsus (the pretarsal claws and the membrane with microtrichia). The shape of the nanomanipulator probe tip was similar to the nanoindentation probe, with a sharp corner, and is solid tungsten ( E for tungsten is 340-380\u2005GPa; Gere and Timoshenko, 1997 ). The nanomanipulator probe was moved to a position where it lightly made contact with the surface of the bed bug cuticle without deforming the cuticle. The nanomanipulator probe was then moved into the cuticle at a speed of 0.5\u2005microns\u2005s \u22121 for depth in the range 1\u22128\u2005microns. Displacement into the surface of the cuticle was verified by removing the probe in one-micron increments until the nanomanipulator probe had clearly lost contact with the surface. Images were taken before insertion of the nanomanipulator probe, during the maximum translation of the nanomanipulator probe, and after removal of the nanomanipulator probe in order to categorize the type of deformation (e.g. plastic versus elastic) ( Fig. 6 ). A total of five legs from five bugs (one leg from each bug, right or left, midleg or hindleg) were each probed at least one time on each of the hree regions per leg: pretarsal claws, membrane with microtrichia on the pretarsus, and tarsal subsegments. A total of 30 insertions ranging from 1\u221210\u2005microns in depth were made. Focused ion beam (FIB) milling to determine cuticle thickness FIB was performed using the FEI Quanta 3D FEG Dual Beam SEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 1.94\u00d710 \u22125 mbar, 16-30\u2005kV and 15\u2005nA using a beam of gallium ions for milling. Specimens were air-dried or critical-point dried and sputter-coated with Ir (5-7\u2005nm deep) before milling with FIB. At least three tarsi on each of three bugs were milled in the claw and tarsal subsegments to allow estimation of cuticle thickness from SEM images recorded while milling. The images (1024\u00d7943 pixels, tiff format) were imported into Canvas 15 (ACDSee, Seattle, WA, USA), the scale determined by the scale bar on the image, and the cuticle thickness measured from the image, rounded to the nearest tenth of a micron. The cut cuticle was viewed at a known angle relative to the milling plane; this angle was typically between 10 and 55\u00b0, because it was not possible to view it at a 90\u00b0 angle normal to the milling plane. The corrected cuticle thickness was calculated by dividing the thickness measured from image by the sine of the angle relative to milling plane to correct for the foreshortening caused by the viewing angle, and rounded to the nearest micron. Statistics Statistical tests were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA). The Proc GLM (General Linear Models) procedure was used for two-way ANOVAs, the interaction terms were included except when noted otherwise, and Type III results are reported. In the Type III model, the order of the parameters does not matter because each effect is adjusted for all other effects ( SAS Institute Inc., 2008 ). The Proc GLM was also used for one-way ANCOVAs. The Proc FREQ procedure was used for chi-square testing. For multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was applied to the significance level by dividing by the number of comparisons (e.g. Sokal and Rohlf, 1995 ; Whitlock and Schluter, 2015 ).

Grazing by domestic animals can facilitate woody encroachment by reducing competition from herbaceous plants and fire frequency. Herbivorous insects and parasitic plants can each exert forces that result in the natural biological control of encroaching woody plants through reducing seeding of their host woody plants. However, the interplay of grazing and dynamics of herbivorous insects or parasitic plants, and its effects on the potential biological control of woody encroachment in grasslands remains unclear. We investigated the flower and pod damage by herbivorous insects, and the infection rates of a parasitic plant on the shrub Caragana microphylla , which is currently encroaching in Inner Mongolia Steppe, under different grazing management treatments (33-year non-grazed, 7-year non-grazed, currently grazed). Our results showed that Caragana biomass was highest at the currently grazed site, and lowest at the 33-year non-grazed site. Herbaceous plant biomass followed the opposite pattern, suggesting that grazing is indeed facilitating the encroachment of Caragana plants in Inner Mongolia Steppe. Grazing also reduced the abundance of herbivorous insects per Caragana flower, numbers of flowers and pods damaged by insect herbivores, and the infection rates of the parasitic plant on Caragana plants. Our results suggest that grazing may facilitate woody encroachment in grasslands not only through canonical mechanisms (e.g. competitive release via feeding on grasses, reductions in fires, etc.), but also by limiting natural biological controls of woody plants (herbivorous insects and parasitic plants). Thus, management efforts must focus on preventing overgrazing to better protect grassland ecosystems from woody encroachment. INTRODUCTION The encroachment of woody plants into grasslands has become one of the most significant biological phenomena globally over the last century ( Eldridge et al., 2011 ; Naito and Cairns, 2011 ). Woody encroachment can have important influences on grassland ecosystem structure and function ( Eldridge et al., 2011 ; Ratajczak et al., 2012 ). A better understanding of the mechanisms mediating woody encroachment is critical for better prediction of the potential alterations to plant community dynamics, and a better understanding of the consequences of such vegetation compositional shifts in grasslands ( Van Auken, 2009 ). Researchers have implicated many climatic and ecological factors mediating woody encroachment, such as changes in temperature, precipitation, CO 2 levels, fire regimes and overgrazing ( Archer et al., 1995 ; Morgan et al., 2007 ; Coetzee et al., 2008 ; Gordijn et al., 2013 ; Kulmatiski and Beard, 2013 ; Matson and Bart, 2013 ). The effects of grazing by mammalian animals on woody encroachment across different rangeland ecosystems are complex ( Van Auken, 2009 ; Sankaran et al., 2013 ). For example, studies in African savannas showed that browsing and trampling by mammalian animals can reduce establishment of woody seedlings ( Sankaran et al., 2008 , 2013 ; Staver et al., 2009 ), while studies in North American semi-arid grasslands showed that high and constant levels of grass herbivory by domestic animals can facilitate woody encroachment ( Scholes and Archer, 1997 ; Van Auken, 2000 , 2009 ). Grazing by domestic animals can reduce biomass of herbaceous plants, resulting in increased resource availability for the establishment of woody plants in grasslands ( Coetzee et al., 2008 ). Grazing by domestic animals also leads to reduction in fire frequency and intensity by reducing the biomass of herbaceous plants ( Oba et al., 2000 ; Roques et al., 2001 ), favoring woody encroachment in grasslands. Herbivorous insects and parasitic plants, on the other hand, can exert important control on plant communities, including the spread of species that are woody encroachers. Insect herbivores can strongly affect the establishment and performance of plant species ( McPherson, 1993 ; Prittinen et al., 2003 ), and thereby have important influence on plant community structure and dynamics ( Brown, 1985 ; Crawley, 1989 ; Brown and Gange, 1992 ; Carson and Root, 2000 ; Borer et al., 2014 ). Insect herbivores can especially reduce seeding rates of their host plants directly by feeding on, laying on, or developing in seeds, or indirectly by damaging the reproductive parts (e.g. flowers) of the plants, and thereby inhibiting seed formation ( Hoffmann and Moran, 1998 ; Hoffmann et al., 2002 ; van Klinken et al., 2003 ; Impson et al., 2011 ). Through these mechanisms, insect herbivores feeding on flowering plants, including woody plants, can act as natural biological controls on the growth and expansion of these plants. Similar to herbivore effects ( Pennings and Callaway, 2002 ; Pennings and Simpson, 2008 ), parasitic plants can also have strong impacts on plant community structure and dynamics by limiting the growth and development of their host plants ( Pennings and Callaway, 1996 ; Callaway and Pennings, 1998 ; Bardgett et al., 2006 ). Thus, parasitic plants on woody host plants can also function as natural biological controls on woody encroachment. Many previous studies have shown that grazing by large herbivorous animals can affect insect diversity and abundance ( Cagnolo et al., 2002 ; Kruess and Tscharntke, 2002 ; Hartley et al., 2003 ; Huntzinger et al., 2008 ; Zhu et al., 2012 ). However, the interplay of grazing and dynamics of herbivorous insects or parasitic plants, and its effects on the potential biological control of woody encroachment in grasslands remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether natural biological controls of woody encroachment in grasslands, herbivorous insects and parasitic plants on woody plants would be altered by different grazing management approaches. We hypothesized that grazing would negatively impact herbivorous insects and parasitic plants on woody plants, thereby limiting the roles that these natural biological controls play in limiting the expansion of woody plants under grazing, further facilitating woody encroachment in grasslands. To test this hypothesis, we examined how three different grazing management treatments affect the flower and pod damage by herbivorous insects, and the infection rates of a parasitic plant on the encroaching legume shrub, Caragana microphylla (hereafter referred to as \u2018 Caragana \u2019), in the semi-arid Inner Mongolia Steppe. RESULTS Aboveground biomass Caragana biomass was highest at the currently grazed site, and lowest at the 33-year non-grazed site ( F 2, 27 =13.10, P <0.01) ( Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the aboveground biomass of herbaceous plants was highest at the 33-year non-grazed site, and lower at the 7-year non-grazed and currently grazed sites ( F 2, 27 =23.72, P <0.01) ( Fig. 1 A). Caragana plants dominated plant communities in terms of biomass at the currently grazed site, but made up a low proportion of the plant community at the 7-year non-grazed and 33-year non-grazed sites ( F 2, 27 =42.12, P <0.01) ( Fig. 1 B).

The percentage of flowers and pods damaged by herbivorous insects on Caragana plants followed a similar pattern: the damaged percentage was greatest at the 33-year non-grazed site, intermediate at the 7-year non-grazed site, and lowest at the currently grazed site (flower damage: F 2,12 =363.04, P <0.01, Fig. 2 B; pod damage: F 2,12 =49.78, P <0.01, Fig. 2 C).

DISCUSSION As has been commonly found in studies of woody encroachment and grazing by domestic animals in arid and semi-arid grasslands ( Scholes and Archer, 1997 ; Van Auken, 2000 , 2009 ), we found that continuous stocking of grazing domestic animals enhanced the growth of Caragana plants, which are currently encroaching in the semi-arid Inner Mongolia Steppe. The facilitative effects of grazing on Caragana encroachment could partially be caused by the commonly recognized mechanisms of reduced competition from herbaceous plants ( Coetzee et al., 2008 ) and reduction in fire frequency under grazing ( Oba et al., 2000 ; Roques et al., 2001 ). Our results revealed that such facilitation of Caragana encroachment in Inner Mongolia Steppe could additionally be caused, in part, by the decreased natural biological controls of herbivorous insects and parasitic plants on Caragana encroachment by grazing. Although grazing by livestock at low intensity and frequency may have little effect on grassland plant communities, high levels of grazing by livestock can lead to reductions in biomass of herbaceous plants and changes in species composition of grasslands, facilitating the transition from grasslands to shrublands or woodlands ( Coetzee et al., 2008 ; Knapp et al., 2008 ; Good et al., 2013 ). Caragana plants are widely distributed in the semi-arid Inner Mongolia Steppe, and they are relatively resistant to grazing disturbance ( Zhang et al., 2006 ). High levels of grazing by livestock during recent decades in the semi-arid Inner Mongolia Steppe has significantly reduced the cover of herbaceous plants ( Li et al., 2013 ; Peng et al., 2013 ), which favored the establishment and growth of the relatively grazing-resistant Caragana plants, thereby promoting the encroachment of this shrub species in the semi-arid Inner Mongolia Steppe. Additionally, our results showed that the herbivorous insect abundance per flower, and flower and pod damage by herbivorous insects, in Caragana plants decreased from the 33-year non-grazed site to the 7-year non-grazed site, and to the currently grazed site, suggesting that grazing had a negative impact on the herbivorous insects on Caragana plants, thus limiting natural biological controls of herbivorous insects on the establishment and expansion of Caragana plants in Inner Mongolia Steppe. Many studies have shown that herbivorous insects can reduce seeding of woody host plants by damaging seeds and reproductive parts, or by inhibiting seed formation by debilitating the host plants, which limits the establishment and spread of woody host plants. For example, Hoffmann and Moran (1998) found that two insect species, a bud-feeder, Trichapion lativentre , and a seed-feeder, Rhyssomatus marginatus , together caused substantial reductions in seeding by the invasive South American tree Sesbania punicea in South Africa. Meiners et al. (2000) found that insect herbivory had strong negative effects on the establishment of four tree species in New Jersey, USA. Hoffmann et al. (2002) reported that gall-forming wasp Trichilogaster sp. could effectively reduce seed production of the invasive Australian tree Acacia pycnantha in South Africa. Chaneton et al. (2010) reported that herbivory by tenebrionid beetles was the main factor limiting the establishment of the woody plant Austrocedrus chilensis in a steppe-woodland ecotone in Argentina. Similarly, at the 33-year and 7-year non-grazed sites in our study, the insect herbivores targeting Caragana plants reduced the fecundity of Caragana plants more strongly by damaging more flowers and pods than at the currently grazed site, indicating relatively strong biological controls of the insect herbivores on the establishment and expansion of Caragana plants at the non-grazed sites versus the currently grazed site. In contrast, the herbivorous insects at the currently grazed site decreased in abundance under the impact of grazing disturbance. Studies in other ecosystems have shown that disturbances can cause local reductions in numbers of insects ( Anderson, 1992 ; Dennis et al., 2008 ; Schowalter, 2012 ); and in our case, insects may simply escape from the currently grazed site to avoid the disturbances from grazing by domestic animals and associated anthropogenic activities ( Braschler et al., 2009 ; Schowalter, 2012 ; Ben-Ari and Inbar, 2013 ). Thus, with lower abundance of herbivorous insects on Caragana plants under grazing disturbance, biological control effects of herbivorous insects on the encroachment of Caragana plants decreased at the currently grazed site. Our results also indicated that grazing also had negative impacts on the parasitic plant Cuscuta , thus decreasing the biological control effects of Cuscuta on the encroachment of Caragana plants in Inner Mongolia Steppe. Previous studies have shown that parasitic plants can have strong effects on the structure and dynamics of plant communities by selectively suppressing the growth of infected plants ( Pennings and Callaway, 1996 ; Callaway and Pennings, 1998 ; Bardgett et al., 2006 ). Additionally, parasitic plants often prefer legumes as host plants because of their relatively high nitrogen content ( Marvier, 1998 ; Pennings and Callaway, 2002 ). At our study sites, the parasitic plant Cuscuta mainly attacked Caragana plants (leguminous shrub species) and had negative effects on the growth of Caragana plants. As the infection rates of Cuscuta on Caragana plants were higher at the non-grazed sites than those at the currently grazed site, we expect that the growth-suppressing effects of the parasitic plant Cuscuta on Caragana plants would be stronger at the two non-grazed sites versus the currently grazed site. Cuscuta infection might contribute to the lower aboveground biomass of Caragana plants at the non-grazed sites versus the currently grazed site. Thus, at the non-grazed sites, the parasitic plant Cuscuta could exert a relatively strong biological control on the encroachment of Caragana plants, as it suppresses the growth, thereby limiting the reproduction of Caragana plants. At the currently grazed site, the infection rate of Cuscuta on Caragana plants was lower, probably due to grazing by domestic animals on Cuscuta plants or seeds ( Nicol et al., 2007 ). This indicated that the parasitic plant Cuscuta was negatively affected by grazing disturbance, thereby having limited biological control effects on the encroachment of Caragana plants at the currently grazed site. Conclusions Overall, our results demonstrated that grazing can negatively affect the herbivorous insects and the parasitic plant Cuscuta on Caragana plants, thus limiting the effectiveness of their natural biological control effects on the establishment and expansion of Caragana plants in the semi-arid Inner Mongolia Steppe. Grazing would release Caragana plants from the pressure of the herbivorous insects and the parasitic plant Cuscuta to some extent, which would, in turn, favour the further encroachment of Caragana plants in the semi-arid Inner Mongolia Steppe. These results indicated that overgrazing would facilitate woody encroachment at a faster rate than previously expected. Also, the relatively weaker biological control effects of the herbivorous insects and the parasitic plant Cuscuta on the expansion of Caragana plants at the 7-year non-grazed site versus the 33-year non-grazed site indicated that it might need a long period of time for grassland ecosystems to recover their functioning after overgrazing disturbance. Our results revealed that grazing facilitates woody encroachment in grasslands not only through the canonical mechanisms commonly known, but also by limiting natural biological controls (herbivorous insects and parasitic plants). Thus, management efforts should focus on preventing overgrazing to better protect grassland ecosystems from woody encroachment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study sites Field work was conducted at the Inner Mongolia Grassland Ecosystem Research Station, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMGERS), which is located in Xilinhaote area on the Inner Mongolia Plateau (43.95\u00b0N, 116.07\u00b0E). The mean annual temperature and precipitation of Xilinhaote area is \u223c2.3\u00b0C and \u223c286\u2005mm, respectively. The mean annual sunshine time and mean daily solar radiation intensity of Xilinhaote area is \u223c2970\u2005h and \u223c1.59\u2005kJ\u2005cm \u22122 day \u22121 , respectively. The vegetation in Xilinhaote area is typical semi-arid Inner Mongolia Steppe, and mainly consists of herbaceous plants, such as the grasses Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis . The woody plant, Caragana microphylla (referred to as \u2018 Caragana \u2019), is encroaching into these grasslands. Caragana plants are legume shrubs, which are relatively resistant to grazing animals ( Zhang et al., 2006 ). In the study area, the herbivorous insects on Caragana plants were mainly the beetle species Mylabris speciosa , Mylabris sibirica , Epicauta gorhami , Epicauta erythrocephala and Labidostomis bipunctata , which mainly prefer to feed on the flowers or pods of Caragana plants (H.G. and C.M., unpublished data), and thereby have strong negative effect on seeding of Caragana plants. In the study area, the parasitic plant on Caragana plants was Cuscuta chinensis (referred to as \u2018 Cuscuta \u2019), which generally prefers legume plants as hosts ( Marvier, 1998 ; Pennings and Callaway, 2002 ; H.G. and C.M., unpublished data), thereby debilitating Caragana plants. In 2012, we conducted field work at three adjacent sites with different grazing management treatments within the IMGERS: the first site (\u223c3\u2005hectares in size) was a mature grassland community that had been fenced to exclude grazing from large herbivorous animals for 33\u2005years (since 1979), following long-term grazing by local livestock (grazing intensity: \u223ctwo sheep unit ha \u22121 ; this site is referred to as the \u201833-year non-grazed site\u2019); the second site (\u223c3\u2005hectares in size) had been fenced to exclude grazing from large animals for 7 years (since 2005), following a long-term grazing by local livestock (grazing intensity: \u223ctwo sheep unit ha \u22121 ; this site is referred to as the \u20187-year non-grazed site\u2019); and the third site had been grazed by local livestock all the time (grazing intensity: \u223ctwo sheep unit ha \u22121 ; this site is referred to as the \u2018currently grazed site\u2019). The three study sites are geographically close to each other and have relatively uniform environmental conditions and plant species compositions, and experienced similar relatively high level grazing by domestic animals before applying the grazing management treatments ( Bai et al., 2010 ; Xie et al., 2016 ). No other management measures were applied to these study sites. Aboveground biomass At each study site, we surveyed the aboveground biomass of the herbaceous plants and Caragana plants, respectively. In August 2012, we randomly located 10 1\u00d71\u2005m sampling plots within each study site, with a distance of \u226520\u2005m between plots. In each plot, we harvested the aboveground biomass of the herbaceous plants and Caragana plants, respectively. Biomass was dried at 65\u00b0C to a constant weight and weighed. Flower and pod damage by herbivorous insects on Caragana plants In the flowering season, April 2012, we set up five parallel transects (120\u2005m each) with a distance of \u226520\u2005m between transects at each study site, and randomly chose six branches of Caragana plants (from six Caragana plants) along each transect (in total 30 branches for each site) to count the number of herbivorous insects on each flower in the field, and then calculated the average number of herbivorous insects per flower for each branch (30 averages per study site). We also randomly sampled 100 flowers from Caragana plants (\u223c30 Caragana plants) along each of the transects to count the number of flowers with damage by herbivorous insects, and then calculated the percentage of flowers damaged by herbivorous insects for each transect (five replicates per study site). We visited the study sites again in August 2012, when the pods of Caragana plants had matured. At each study site, we set up five parallel transects (120\u2005m each) with a distance of \u226520\u2005m between transects, and randomly sampled 100 pods from Caragana plants (\u223c30 Caragana plants) along each transect to count the number of pods with damage by herbivorous insects, and then calculated the percentage of pods damaged by herbivorous insects for each transect (five replicates per study site). Infection rates of the parasitic plant Cuscuta on Caragana plants At each study site, we studied the infection rates of the parasitic plant Cuscuta on Caragana plants. In August 2012, we set up five parallel transects (100\u2005m each) within each study site, with a distance of \u226520\u2005m between transects. Along each transect, we sampled Caragana plants approximately every 10\u2005m (10 Caragana plants sampled per transect), and counted the number of Caragana plants infected by Cuscuta , and then calculated the infection rate of Cuscuta plants on Caragana plants for each transect (five replicates per study site). Data analysis Data analyses were performed with JMP9 statistical software ( SAS Institute, 2010 ). We used ANOVAs to test the differences of means among the grazing management treatments for all variables (all data met the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances), and then performed post-hoc Tukey's HSD tests to explicitly compare the means between the grazing management treatments for all the variables.

from the sheet. Cell extrusion, which is required for maintenance of tissue integrity, is the consequence of contraction of actomyosin rings, as demonstrated by both molecular/cellular biological experimentation and numerical simulation. However, quantitative evaluation of actomyosin contraction has not been performed because of the lack of a suitable direct measurement system. In this study, we developed a new method using a femtosecond laser to quantify the contraction force of the actomyosin ring during cell extrusion in zebrafish embryonic epithelia. In this system, an epithelial cell in zebrafish embryo is first damaged by direct femtosecond laser irradiation. Next, a femtosecond laser-induced impulsive force is loaded onto the actomyosin ring, and the contraction force is quantified to be on the order of kPa as a unit of pressure. We found that cell extrusion was delayed when the contraction force was slightly attenuated, suggesting that a relatively small force is sufficient to drive cell extrusion. Thus, our method is suitable for the relative quantitative evaluation of mechanical dynamics in the process of cell extrusion, and in principle the method is applicable to similar phenomena in different tissues and organs of various species. INTRODUCTION The internal and external surfaces of the body are covered with epithelial sheets, and the primary role of these sheets is to provide a protective barrier against physical damage and infections. The integrity of the epithelial sheet is maintained throughout the lifespan of the organism ( Madison, 2003 ), and turnover of epithelial cells occurs over short timescales (e.g. 5\u2005days in intestine, and 26\u201328\u2005days in skin) ( Barker, 2014 ; Weinstein and Van Scott, 1965 ). If dying or dead cells remain in the epithelial sheet, epithelial integrity is disrupted, leading to disorders such as abnormal morphogenesis, inflammation, and cancer ( Eisenhoffer et al., 2012 ; Igaki et al., 2009 ; Martin, 1997 ). Thus, organisms from invertebrates to mammals have evolved a system called cell extrusion, which removes dying/dead cells from the sheet without damaging neighboring healthy cells or disrupting barrier function ( Eisenhoffer and Rosenblatt, 2013 ; Katoh and Fujita, 2012 ; Rosenblatt et al., 2001 ). Previous studies reported critical roles for actin filaments and myosin motor proteins in the process of cell extrusion ( Eisenhoffer and Rosenblatt, 2013 ; Katoh and Fujita, 2012 ; Rosenblatt et al., 2001 ; Tamada et al., 2007 ). When cell death in an epithelial cell is induced, filamentous actins (F-actins) in the surrounding cells accumulate, generating an actin ring. Subsequently, the Rho and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway is activated in the surrounding cells, leading to phosphorylation of myosin II and contraction of actomyosin ( Kuipers et al., 2014 ; Rosenblatt et al., 2001 ; Tamada et al., 2007 ). As a result, the actomyosin ring shrinks at the basal side, pushing the dying cell out of the sheet. However, it remains unknown how much force is generated by the contraction of the actomyosin ring during cell extrusion, largely due to the lack of a system for direct measurement of such forces in epithelial sheets in vivo . The mechanical forces generated by living cells have been measured in vitro for some biological processes, including cell migration and cell\u2013cell or cell\u2013matrix interactions. For instance, both traction force microscopy (TFM) and the micropillar assay track the deformation of synthetic elastic polymer substrates during cell migration, yielding an estimate of the magnitude of the traction force at leading edges of single cells during cell migration ( Balaban et al., 2001 ; Discher et al., 2005 ; Fu et al., 2010 ; Munevar et al., 2001 ; Roca-Cusachs et al., 2017 ). In single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS), varying magnitudes of tensional forces are loaded onto the interface between two cells, and the adhesive force between them is measured ( Benoit et al., 2000 ; Krieg et al., 2008 ). However, these strategies require that the cells be removed from the organism and manipulated under specific experimental conditions that differ from the physiological environment. Therefore, such methods cannot measure the force generated in the process of cell extrusion, which occurs in the epithelial sheets of living organisms. Previously, we developed a method using a femtosecond laser to generate impulsive force, allowing quantification of cell adhesion between cultured cells (e.g. leukocytes and endothelial cells), epithelial cells with one another, and neurons and mast cells ( Hosokawa et al., 2011 ; Iino et al., 2016 ; Kaji et al., 2007 ). When a femtosecond laser is focused through an objective lens, a stress wave is generated at the laser focal point. The stress wave propagates spherically from the focal point, and acts to cells as an impulsive force. Consequently, when the laser is focused near a site of cell\u2013cell contact, the adhesion is disrupted without damaging the cell. Furthermore, by measuring the magnitude of the impulsive force using an atomic force microscope (AFM), we succeeded in quantifying the force of cell adhesion in vitro ( Hosokawa et al., 2011 ; Iino and Hosokawa, 2010 ). In a recent study, we used the femtosecond laser to directly irradiate a specific type of cell within living zebrafish embryos, and succeeded in establishing a single-cell ablation technique in vivo (H.I., R.A., S.Y., Y.B., Y.H. and T.M., unpublished data). Our in vivo and in vitro results from that work inspired us to develop a new methodology for measuring the force generated by actomyosin ring contraction during cell extrusion from epithelial sheets in living organisms. In this study, we used the femtosecond laser as a loader of the external force, and the enveloping layer (an epithelial cell sheet of zebrafish embryos) as an in vivo model system for cell extrusion. Our results confirmed that force is generated by contraction of the actomyosin ring during cell extrusion. We also quantified the magnitude of the force by counter-balancing it with a calibrated impulsive force. Based on this measurement, we conclude that a relatively small force produced by actomyosin ring contraction is capable of driving cell extrusion. RESULTS Observation of dynamic changes in the actomyosin ring during cell extrusion in living zebrafish embryos First, we developed a system for observing the dynamics of the actomyosin ring during cell extrusion in living zebrafish embryos. To visualize the actomyosin ring, we overexpressed either Lifeact-GFP or MRLC-GFP, which labels F-actin or myosin II, respectively. In a parallel study, we established a single-cell ablation technique in living zebrafish embryos (H.I., R.A., S.Y., Y.B., Y.H. and T.M., unpublished data), and we used this method to induce cell death in epithelial sheets. When the center of an epithelial cell at mid-gastrulation stage was irradiated with the femtosecond laser, the dying cell was pushed out of the epithelial sheet ( Fig. 1 A). Both F-actin and myosin II accumulated at the membranes of surrounding cells within approximately 120\u2005s after laser irradiation, leading to formation of an actomyosin ring ( Fig. 1 A,B; Movies 1 and 2 ). Subsequently, the actomyosin ring tightened until cell extrusion was complete ( Fig. 1 A,B; Movies 1 and 2 ). Thus, we succeeded in establishing a system for observing actomyosin dynamics during cell extrusion in vivo . Download powerpoint Fig. 1.

The targeted cell is marked by dotted white lines. (B) Dynamic changes of myosin II during cell extrusion in a MRLC\u2013GFP-overexpressing embryo.

Scale bars: 10\u2005\u00b5m. Measurement of the mechanical force generated by contraction of the actomyosin ring during cell extrusion To measure the contractile force during cell extrusion, we first induced cell extrusion in zebrafish embryos via direct irradiation with the femtosecond laser ( Fig. 2 A, left panel, see also Fig. 1 ). Next, when the actomyosin ring was formed and started to contract (as noted above, approximately 120\u2005s after laser irradiation), a series of impulsive forces was loaded (50 times at 1\u2005s intervals) at the center of the actomyosin ring ( Fig. 2 A, right panel). At the beginning of force loading, the actomyosin ring did not contract, but instead expanded ( Fig. 2 B,C; Movie 3 ). After the expansion, contraction was interrupted during the period of force loading ( Fig. 2 B,C; Movie 3 ); however, when force loading was stopped, the ring contraction restarted ( Fig. 2 B,C; Movie 3 ). This observation suggests that, when the impulsive force was loaded at the center of the actomyosin ring, the force generated by actomyosin ring contraction was counter-balanced by the impulsive force.

Left panel: To induce cell extrusion, the center of the targeted cell was irradiated with 15\u2005nJ/pulse femtosecond laser at time 0\u2005s (a red bar at time 0\u2005s in lower panel). Right panel: After the actomyosin ring was generated and started to tighten, a series of laser pulses (10\u201360\u2005nJ/pulse) was loaded every 1\u2005s at the center of the actomyosin ring (red bars in lower panel). (B,C) Representative results of the impulsive force loading experiment in a Lifeact\u2013GFP-overexpressing embryo. Still images (B) were extracted from Movie 3 . Yellow dotted line in the panel at 170\u2005s marks the size of the actomyosin ring at 138\u2005s (before loading of impulsive force). Scale bar: 10 \u00b5m. Asterisks at 0 s and 138 s indicate the focal points of femtosecond laser. (C) To characterize actomyosin ring contraction, the size of the actomyosin ring was measured at each time point and plotted over time. Because the actomyosin ring contracts in a concentric fashion, from outside to inside, the force generated by the actomyosin ring contraction can be estimated from a relationship between the counter-balanced radius R and the incident laser pulse energy L . The impulsive force can be calibrated by using AFM as reported previously ( Iino and Hosokawa, 2010 ). When the femtosecond laser is focused in the vicinity of the AFM cantilever, the total force F 0 generated at the laser focal point is estimated from the bending movement of the cantilever. From the plot shown in Fig. S1A , the relationship between L and F 0 can be expressed as: (1) The total force F 0 generated at the center of the actomyosin ring is calculated from L by Eqn 1. We investigated the relationship between the square of the ring radius R 2 and L in Lifeact\u2013GFP-overexpressing embryos, in which L varied from 10 to 60\u2005nJ/pulse and R 2 was evaluated as a function of L ( Fig. S1B ). When L was converted to F 0 by Eqn 1, we observed a linear correlation between R 2 and F 0 ( Fig. 3 A, Control). This result clearly indicates that the impulsive force is counter-balanced by the contractile force of the actomyosin ring during laser irradiation. Download powerpoint Fig. 3. Myosin II activity is required for force generation during cell extrusion. (A) Square of radius R 2 is proportional to total force F 0 in Control (black dots), Y27632- (red dots), and Blebbistatin-treated embryos (blue dots) (correlation coefficient, R 2 =0.77, 0.68, and 0.70 in Control, Y27632-, and Blebbistatin-treated embryos). Magnitude of contractile force produced during cell extrusion in Control, Y27632-, or Blebbistatin-treated embryos was estimated, and is shown in Table 1 . (B) Representative images of actomyosin ring before (left panels) and after (right panels) loading of impulsive force. Upper panels: Control embryo; middle panels: Y27632-treated embryo; lower panels: Blebbistatin-treated embryo. Upon treatment with 10\u2005\u00b5M of Y27632 or 50\u2005\u00b5M of Blebbistatin, the actomyosin ring was still formed. (C,D) Representative images of dynamics of F-actin during cell extrusion in a Lifeact\u2013GFP-overexpressing embryo treated with Y27632 (C) or Blebbistatin (D). Still images were extracted from Movies 4 and 5 . The x-z views of images (lower panels) were obtained by the cross-section at the white line in x-y views (upper panels). At time 0\u2005s, the focal point marked by asterisks was irradiated with the femtosecond laser. Scale bars: 10\u2005\u00b5m. From the linear correlation, we can estimate the pressure loaded on the actomyosin ring as a constant value. Assuming that F 0 propagates spherically as a volume wave in the vicinity of the laser focal point, the pressure P at distance R from the laser focal point is expressed by: (2) As the laser is focused at the center of the actomyosin ring, when the radius of the actomyosin ring is R , P corresponds to pressure loaded on the actomyosin ring. The data in Fig. 3 A are least-squares fitted by: (3) and the linear factor a is converted to the pressure P by: (4) which is derived from Eqn 2. Accordingly, the force of contraction of the actomyosin ring is estimated to be 3.71\u2005kPa ( Table 1 , Control). This represents the first in vivo measurement result of the mechanical force required for cell extrusion. View this table: Estimated force and extrusion time in Control, Y27632-, and Blebbistatin-treated embryos Relative quantitative evaluation of contraction force generated by the actomyosin ring Our quantitative analysis of the contraction force (this study) suggested that cell extrusion is driven by a force of relatively small magnitude produced by actomyosin ring contraction. To confirm this conclusion, we partially inhibited actomyosin contraction by treatment with Y27632 (a ROCK inhibitor) or Blebbistatin (a myosin II inhibitor) and investigated the effects on the mechanical dynamics of the actomyosin ring. We measured the mechanical force generated by actomyosin ring contraction in Y27632- or Blebbistatin-treated embryos by loading impulsive forces onto the ring ( Fig. 3 B). Under these conditions, the force was estimated to be 2.58 or 2.40\u2005kPa, smaller than in the control (3.71\u2005kPa) ( Fig. 3 A, Table 1 ). An actomyosin ring was still formed in the manipulated embryos following direct femtosecond laser irradiation, but cell extrusion was delayed for approximately 100\u2005s ( Fig. 3 C,D, Table 1 ; Movies 4 and 5 ). These results suggest that the dynamics of cell extrusion are drastically affected by slight modulation of the contraction force. Taking all results together, we conclude that contraction of the actomyosin ring can generate a mechanical force on the order of kPa, and that this force of relatively small magnitude is capable of properly removing the targeted cell during cell extrusion in zebrafish. DISCUSSION Based on technical advances in mechano-biology, mechanical forces generated by living cells have been measured using AFM, TFM, micropillar assay, and SCFS ( Balaban et al., 2001 ; Krieg et al., 2008 ; Munevar et al., 2001 ; Stewart et al., 2011 ). However, in these systems, cells must be dissected from the tissues and organs of living organisms. Consequently, it has been difficult to measure a mechanical force under physiological conditions (e.g. within tissues or organs of living organisms). In this study, we sought to devise a system for measuring such forces during the process of cell extrusion in living zebrafish epithelia, and succeeded in measuring this force under physiological conditions. Our results revealed that a relatively small force generated by surrounding cells is sufficient to drive cell extrusion, highlighting the importance of mechanical regulation of this physiological phenomenon. Using femotosecond laser-induced impulsive force, we estimated that a mechanical force on the order of kPa is generated during cell extrusion. Since nanosecond ultra-violet laser has been mainly used as a light source for the laser ablation ( Behrndt et al., 2012 ; Campinho et al., 2013 ), nanosecond laser seems to be applicable for the force measurement during cell extrusion. However, in fact, nanosecond laser is not suitable for the force measurement because nanosecond laser is absorbed in the light pass and the absorbed light energy is mainly converted to heat, but not to impulsive force. Because no system has been developed that is capable of measuring mechanical force in vivo , it is very difficult to judge the accuracy of our measurement system. However, our estimates of the magnitude of this force are comparable to those of the traction force generated by cell\u2013matrix interactions in vitro ( Fu et al., 2010 ; Geiger et al., 2001 ). These findings thus support the accuracy of our measurement system. In our system, we load a series of impulsive forces at the center of the actomyosin ring and estimate the force resulting from contraction of the actomyosin ring. Thus, we consider that actomyosin ring contraction produces extrusion force. However, actomyosin ring contraction is not the only source of the extrusion force: other force factors (e.g. circumferential contraction of the extruding cell, protrusive forces from surrounding cells and pushing forces from deep cell underneath) may also contribute to cell extrusion. Accordingly, in the near future, it would be of interest to investigate how the magnitude of the force is changed upon manipulation of other force generating processes by applying anisotropic tension for epithelial cells, and removing deep cells ( Campinho et al., 2013 ; Morita et al., 2017 ) and/or upon loading of the impulsive force at different places, including cell protrusions. Physiological phenomena, including epiboly, dorsal closure, cell competition, and wound healing, which occur in different tissues and organs in different species, use mechanisms similar to those of cell extrusion ( Kajita et al., 2010 ; Schwayer et al., 2016 ). Due to the lack of appropriate experimental systems, their mechanical features have not yet been characterized. Therefore, our measurement system represents a powerful tool for measuring the forces involved in these physiological phenomena, and provides an understanding of how mechanical force contributes to the regulation of these phenomena. We are currently applying our system to studies of cell competition and wound healing in both cultured MDCK cells and zebrafish embryos, with the goal of elucidating the mechanical properties underlying these processes. MATERIAL AND METHODS Zebrafish experiments Wild-type zebrafish were used in this study. All zebrafish experiments were performed with the approval of the Nara Institute of Science and Technology's Animal Studies Committee. Synthesis of mRNA and injection pCS2- Lifeact-GFP and pCS2- MRLC-GFP [gifts from Drs Noriyuki Kinoshita (National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan) and Yasuyuki Fujita (The University of Hokkaido, Japan), respectively] were used as templates for mRNA synthesis. Lifeact-GFP and MRLC-GFP mRNAs were synthesized using the SP6 mMessage mMachine System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lifeact-GFP mRNA (100\u2005pg) or Myosin II regulatory light chain-GFP ( MRLC-GFP ) mRNA (200\u2005pg) were injected into the yolk of one-cell-stage zebrafish embryos, as described previously ( Matsui et al., 2005 ). Inhibitor treatment Injected embryos were developed until 5\u2005h post-fertilization (hpf), treated with 10\u2005\u00b5M Y27632 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) or 50\u2005\u00b5M Blebbistatin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60\u2005min, and then used for experiments. Non-treated or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle)-treated embryos were used as negative controls. Induction of cell extrusion in zebrafish embryonic epithelia and observation of dynamics of actomyosin Injected embryos were developed at around 6\u2005hpf, dechorionated, and mounted in the holes of a gel made with 1% low-melting-point agarose (Nacalai Tesque) on 35\u2005mm glass bottom dishes (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan). A single shot of 800\u2005nm laser pulse (15\u2005nJ/pulse), generated by a titanium-sapphire femtosecond laser system (Solstice Ace, Spectra-Physics, California, USA), was focused through a 100\u00d7/1.25 objective lens (Olympus) into the center of epithelial cells located near the animal poles of embryos at 6\u2005hpf. Dynamic changes of the actomyosin ring were observed with a confocal microscope (FV300, Olympus) for 5\u201310\u2005min at 1\u201315\u2005s intervals. Z -stack images of the embryos (8\u201317 planes at 1 or 2\u2005\u03bcm intervals) were obtained. Actomyosin ring size (\u00b5m 2 ) in each time point was measured by Image J software (NIH). Quantification of mechanical force generated by actomyosin ring contraction Single shot of the femtosecond laser (15\u2005nJ/pulse) was focused into the center of epithelial cell. Next, when the actomyosin ring was formed and started to contract (approximately 120\u2005s after laser irradiation), a series of impulsive forces (10\u201360\u2005nJ/pulse) was loaded (50 times at 1\u2005s intervals) at the center of the actomyosin ring. Dynamic changes of the actomyosin ring were observed with a confocal microscope (FV300, Olympus) for 5\u2005min at 1\u2005s intervals. Actomyosin ring size (\u00b5m 2 ) in each time point was measured by Image J. In addition, counter-balanced radius R (\u00b5m) of the ring was measured. Using the measurement results and Eqns 1\u20134, force generated by actomyosin ring contraction was estimated as described in the Results. Statistical analysis Differences in means were analyzed by one-tailed Student's t -test. The results of t -tests were considered significant when P <0.01. Acknowledgements We are grateful to Drs N.

Haines PDF Abstract Ram suspension-feeding fishes swim with an open mouth to force water through the oral cavity and extract prey items that are too small to be pursued individually. Recent research has indicated that, rather than using a dead-end mechanical sieve, American paddlefish ( Polyodon spathula Walbaum) employ vortical cross-step filtration. In this filtration mechanism, vortical flow that is generated posterior to the branchial arches organizes crossflow filtration processes into a spatial structure across the gill rakers. Despite the known impact of locomotor kinematics on fluid flow around the bodies of swimming fish, the effects of locomotor kinematics on filtration mechanisms in ram suspension feeders are unknown. Potential temporal organization of filtration mechanisms in ram suspension-feeding fish has not been studied previously. We investigated the effects of locomotor kinematics associated with undulatory swimming on intra-oral flow patterns and food particle transport. A mechanized model of the oral cavity was used to simulate the swimming kinematics of suspension-feeding paddlefish. We recorded fluctuations of flow speed and pressure within the model, which occurred at a frequency that corresponded with the frequency of the model's strides. Using the mechanized model in a flow tank seeded with Artemia cysts, we also showed that swimming kinematics aided the transport of this simulated food to the posterior margins of the gill slots, although the time scale of this transport is expected to vary with prey parameters such as size and concentration. Dye stream experiments revealed that, while stable vortical flow formed due to flow separation downstream of backward-facing steps in control trials, vortical flow structures in mechanized trials repeatedly formed and shed. These findings suggest strong integration between locomotor and feeding systems in ram suspension-feeding fishes.

The ability to respond to human gestures and language, and the hypersocial behaviours of dogs are considered key factors that have led them to become man's best friend. Free-ranging dogs provide an excellent model system for understanding the dog-human relationship in various social contexts. In India, free-ranging dogs occur in all possible human habitations. They scavenge among garbage, beg for food from humans, give birth in dens close to human habitations, and establish social bonds with people. However, there is ample dog-human conflict on streets, leading to morbidity and mortality of dogs. Hence the ability to assess an unfamiliar human before establishing physical contact could be adaptive for dogs especially in the urban environment. We tested a total of 103 adult dogs to investigate their response to immediate social and long-term food and social rewards. The dogs were provided a choice of obtaining a food either from experimenter's hand or the ground. The dogs avoided making physical contact with the unfamiliar human. While immediate social reward was not effective in changing this response, the long-term test showed a strong effect of social contact.

Substrates composed of granular media, such as sand and gravel, are extremely common in nature, and vary tremendously in particle size and shape. Despite many studies of the properties of granular media and comparisons of locomotion between granular and solid substrates, the effects of systematically manipulating these media on locomotion is poorly understood. We studied granular media ranging over four orders of magnitude in particle size, and differing in the amount of particle shape variation, to determine how these factors affected substrate physical properties and sprinting in the generalist lizard Eremias arguta . We found that media with intermediate particle sizes had high bulk densities, low angles of stability and low load-bearing capacities. Rock substrates with high shape variation had higher values for all three properties than glass bead substrates with low shape variation. We found that E. arguta had the highest maximum velocities and accelerations on intermediate size particles, and higher velocities on rock than glass beads. Lizards had higher stride frequencies and lower duty factors on intermediate particle size substrates, but their stride lengths did not change with substrate. Our findings suggest that sand and gravel may represent different locomotor challenges for animals. Sand substrates provide animals with an even surface for running, but particles shift underfoot. In contrast, gravel particles are heavy, so move far less underfoot, yet provide the animal with an uneven substrate. FOOTNOTES The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

All inner cells coexpress lineage markers such as Nanog and Gata6 at embryonic day (E) 3.25, and the EPI and PrE precursor cells eventually segregate to exclusively express Nanog and Gata6 , respectively. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)\u2013extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling is involved in segregation of the EPI and PrE lineages; however, the mechanism involved in Fgf4 regulation is poorly understood. Here, we identified Klf5 as an upstream repressor of Fgf4 . Fgf4 was markedly upregulated in Klf5 knockout (KO) embryos at E3.0, and was downregulated in embryos overexpressing Klf5 . Furthermore, Klf5 KO and overexpressing blastocysts showed skewed lineage specification phenotypes, similar to FGF4-treated preimplantation embryos and Fgf4 KO embryos, respectively. Inhibitors of the FGF receptor (Fgfr) and ERK pathways reversed the skewed lineage specification of Klf5 KO blastocysts. These data demonstrate that Klf5 suppresses Fgf4-Fgfr-ERK signalling, thus preventing precocious activation of the PrE specification programme.

B\u00edcego Department of Animal Morphology and Physiology, College of Agricultural and Veterinarian Sciences, S\u00e3o Paulo State University, Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil National Institute of Science and Technology on Comparative Physiology (INCT- Fisiologia Comparada), Brazil PDF Abstract Many adult mammals and birds respond to heat with thermal tachypnea, an increase in breathing frequency with shallow tidal volume, with minimal increase in oxygen consumption (V\u0307 O 2 ). This pattern favors heat dissipation by evaporative water loss (EWL) through the respiratory tract. We asked to what extent this response was apparent at the earliest stages of development, when pulmonary ventilation (V\u0307 E ) initiates. Measurements of V\u0307 E (barometric technique), V\u0307 O 2 (open-flow methodology) and EWL (water scrubbers) were performed on chicken embryos at the earliest appearance of V\u0307 E , during the internal pipping stage. Data were collected, first, at the normal incubation temperature (37.5\u00b0C); then, ambient and egg temperatures were increased to approximately 44\u00b0C over a 2 h period. Other embryos of the same developmental stage (controls) were maintained in normothermia for the whole duration of the experiment. During heat exposure, the embryo's V\u0307 O 2 and carbon dioxide production increased little. In contrast, V\u0307 E more than doubled (\u223c128% increase) entirely because of the large rise in breathing frequency (\u223c132% increase), with no change in tidal volume. EWL did not change significantly, probably because within the egg the thermal and water vapor gradients are almost non-existent. We conclude that chicken embryos respond to a major heat load with tachypnea, like many adult mammals and birds do. The appearance so early in development, although ineffective for heat loss, signifies that thermal tachypnea represents an important breathing response necessary to be functional since hatching.

During breeding, king penguins fast voluntarily for up to 1.5 months in the colony, after which they replenish their energy stores at sea. However, at sea, birds might encounter periods of low foraging profitability, forcing them to draw from previously stored energy (e.g. subcutaneous fat). Accessing peripheral fat stores requires perfusion, increasing heat loss and thermoregulatory costs. Hence, how these birds balance the conflicting demands of nutritional needs and thermoregulation is unclear. We investigated the physiological responses of king penguins to fasting in cold water by (1) monitoring tissue temperatures, as a proxy of tissue perfusion, at four distinct sites (deep and peripheral) and (2) recording their oxygen consumption rate, while birds floated inside a water tank. Despite frequent oscillations, temperatures of all tissues often reached near normothermic levels, indicating that birds maintained perfusion to peripheral tissues throughout their fasting period in water. The oxygen consumption rate of birds increased with fasting duration in water, while it was also higher when the flank tissue was warmer, indicating greater perfusion. Hence, fasting king penguins in water maintained peripheral perfusion, despite the associated greater heat loss and, therefore, thermoregulatory costs, probably to access subcutaneous fat stores. Hence, the observed normothermia in peripheral tissues of king penguins at sea, upon completion of a foraging bout, is likely explained by their nutritional needs: depositing FFA in subcutaneous tissues after profitable foraging or mobilizing FFA to fuel metabolism, when foraging success was insufficient.

At the same time, one of their fundamental roles is to facilitate metabolic processes to accommodate changes in energetic demands. While the metabolic function of GCs is thought to be ubiquitous across vertebrates, we are not aware of experiments which tested this directly, i.e., in which metabolic rate was manipulated and measured together with GCs. We therefore tested for a relationship between plasma corticosterone (CORT, ln transformed) and metabolic rate (MR, measured using indirect calorimetry) in a between- and within-individual design in captive zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata ) of both sexes. In each individual, CORT and MR were measured at two different temperature levels: \u2018warm\u2019 (22\u00b0C) and \u2018cold\u2019 (12 \u00b0C). CORT and MR were both increased in colder compared to warmer conditions, within individuals, but also across individuals. At the between-individual level, we found a positive relationship between CORT and MR, with an accelerating slope towards higher MR and CORT values. In contrast, the within individual changes in CORT and MR in response to colder conditions were linearly correlated between individuals. The CORT-MR relationship did not differ between the sexes. Our results illustrate the importance of including variation at different levels to better understand physiological modulation. Furthermore, our findings support the interpretation of CORT variation as indicator of metabolic needs.

The group dynamics of hierarchy formation are not characterized in the Norway lobsters ( Nephrops norvegicus ). Lobsters spend most of the day in burrows and forage outside of them according to a diel (i.e. 24-h based) activity rhythm. Here, we use a linear and generalized mixed model approach to analyse, in 7 groups of 4 male lobsters, the formation of dominance hierarchies and rank related changes in burrowing behaviour. We show that hierarchies emerge within 1 to 3 days and increase in steepness over a period of 5 days, while rank changes and number of fights gradually decrease over a 5 day period. The rank position determined by open area fights predicts the outcome of fights over burrows, the time spent in burrows, and the locomotor activity levels. Dominant lobsters are more likely to evict subordinate lobsters from their burrows and more successful in defending their own burrows. They spend more time in burrows and display lower levels of locomotor activity outside the burrow. Lobsters do not change their diel activity rhythms as a result of a change in rank, and all tested individuals showed higher activity at night and dusk compared to dawn and day. We discuss how behavioural changes in burrowing behaviour could lead to rank related benefits such a reduced exposure to predators and energy savings.

Photo credit: Florian Muijres. Stealth and haste are often at the heart of most successful raids, and the forays of famished female mosquitoes are no different. \u2018Female mosquitoes need a blood meal to develop their eggs\u2019, explains Florian Muijres, from Wageningen University, The Netherlands, adding that zipping in and out after a quick sip without attracting the attention of the unfortunate victim is essential if the insect is to survive. \u2018One critical manoeuvre is the escape take-off after blood-feeding\u2019, says Muijres. The fully loaded insect should push off quickly from the surface of its victim to get away swiftly, but a softer and gentler take-off would be less likely to arouse the attention of a disgruntled host. Knowing that humans are particularly vulnerable to mosquito bites, which can transmit deadly disease, Muijres, Jeroen Spitzen (Wageningen University) and Sofia Chang (University of California, Berkeley, USA) scrutinised the voracious insect's escape technique to find out how it manages to evade scrutiny when fully laden. \u2018The experimental setup was rather complex\u2019, admits Muijres, describing how Chang had to ensure that the insects were well fed on human blood before take-off trials, in addition to coordinating three cameras trained on the insect's launch pad to capture every aspect of the departure in minute detail. \u2018To get everything to work properly required a lot of preparation, precise work and a steady hand\u2019, chuckles Muijres. As most insects simply hurl themselves into the air with a hefty push of the legs, Chang, Muijres and Wouter van Veen were surprised to find that the mosquitoes began beating their wings about 30 ms before the final push-off, using an extraordinarily high wingbeat frequency of \u223c600 beats s \u20131 compared with \u223c200 beats s \u20131 used by other similarly sized insects. And when the team calculated how hard the mosquitoes pushed down on their victim over the course of a take-off, they realised that the insects took advantage of their exceptionally long legs, extending them gently while pushing down slowly over the 30 ms take-off, leaving the unsuspecting injured party none the wiser of the departure. In addition, when Chang and Muijres calculated the wings\u2019 contribution to the take-off, they were impressed that they contributed 60% of the force needed to lift a well-fed mosquito off its victim. Next, the team compared the mosquitoes\u2019 take-off performance with that of more stocky fruit flies to find out whether the mosquitoes had compromised the speed of their evasive action for a light-footed getaway. Calculating the take-off force generated by a sturdy fruit fly, the team was surprised that the take-offs weighed in at almost four times the forces exerted by the nimble mosquitoes; sufficient to attract the attention of a human. However, when the team compared the two insects\u2019 take-off speeds, the mosquitoes were every bit as speedy (\u223c0.24 m s \u22121 ) as their heavy-footed counterparts. Mosquitoes are not penalised by their softly-softly strategy, and are every bit as swift as less subtle insects. And when Bart Biemans compared the size of the mosquito and fruit fly leg muscles, the mosquito leg muscles were smaller, \u2018because they need to produce a lower force at push-off\u2019, says Muijres. Having discovered the secret behind the mosquito's stealthy departure, Muijres and his colleagues are keen to find out whether other blood-sucking pests use the same strategy to outwit their victims and whether the irritating insects\u2019 landings are as graceful as their departures. \u00a9 2017.

Photo credit: Andy Turko. There is a very good reason why the largest creatures reside in our oceans. \u2018The buoyant support of water can explain why whales are so much larger than elephants\u2019, says Andy Turko, from the University of Guelph, Canada. In contrast, the skeletons of terrestrial animals are moulded by the effects of gravity: they can detect and adjust to changes as they gain or lose weight. Which begs the question: can fish skeletons also detect and respond to gravity? \u2018Some researchers have assumed that they would never have needed to evolve the ability to sense or respond to gravity\u2019, says Turko; terrestrial animals \u2013 including the whale's ancestors \u2013 were believed to have evolved the sense only after they left their fish cousins in the water. However, Turko and his colleagues Patricia Wright and Doug Fudge wondered whether the ability to sense gravity is more ancient. Knowing that amphibious fish, such as the mangrove rivulus ( Kryptolebias marmoratus ), routinely experience the effects of gravity when they clamber onto land, Wright, Fudge and Turko wondered whether the tiny fish can stiffen their skeletons when their weight increases after leaving the water. Fixing on the 1 mm long gill arch as the most suitable bone in the fish's body to test, Turko and Fudge kept some of the fish on dry land for 1 and 2 weeks, while another group of fish was allowed to remain in water, before comparing the stiffness of their gill arches. Impressively, the gill arch bones of the fish that were out of water were 60% stiffer than those of the submerged fish after 1 week and the effects of gravity persisted for more than 2 weeks after the fish's return to water. However, the team wasn't entirely convinced that they could attribute the bone's increased stiffness to the effect of gravity alone: were they becoming stiffer as a result of drying? Turko and Wright realised that they would have to simulate weightless conditions while the fish were out of water before they could be convinced that gravity was the culprit. Recalling that Roger Croll, Frank Smith and Matthew Stoyek, from Dalhousie University, used a random positioning machine to simulate the effects of low gravity on developing zebrafish embryos, Wright sent Turko to Dalhousie to test whether the fish's bones became stiffer when they were effectively weightless while out of water. After a week of gyrating the air-exposed fish in microgravity \u2013 to simulate weightlessness out of water \u2013 and measuring the stiffness of their gill arches, the bones were as flexible as those of the fish that were swimming free. So the bones had not become stiffer because they were drying out. Fish that climb out of water onto land are able to sense the effects of gravity and increase the stiffness of their bones to bear the extra weight. But how were the high-and-dry fish modifying their bones to increase their stiffness? Extracting proteins from the bones of fish that had spent 2 weeks out of water, Dietmar K\u00fcltz, from the University of California, Davis, USA, was impressed to see an extraordinary (ninefold) increase in one protein, type X collagen, which is known to be involved in bone growth. \u2018To see such a dramatic increase was exciting evidence that gravity exposure causes bone growth\u2019, says Turko. Having found that fish are able to sense the effects of gravity, Turko suspects that this ability may help fish to adapt their skeletons to withstand the stresses and strains of swimming. He also suggests that our ancient fish ancestors may have been able to stiffen their skeletons in response to weight gains when they first pulled themselves out of the water. \u2018This may mean that something considered a major challenge during the invasion of land by vertebrates (supporting their own body weight) may not actually have been that challenging of an evolutionary problem\u2019, says Turko. \u00a9 2017.

Photo credit: Philip Bergmann. Many animals take the surfaces across which they move in their stride: some slow down if a surface is less to their liking, while others relish the same material and surge forward. \u2018Species sometimes use different approaches for dealing with changes in the surfaces that they are running on\u2019, says Philip Bergmann, from Clark University, USA, who was intrigued by how steppe-runner lizards cope when running on surfaces ranging from fine sand to gravel. However, he adds, \u2018No one had really taken a systematic approach, looking at substrates composed of different particle sizes\u2026 and no one had studied the effects of the shape of the particles on locomotion\u2019. As steppe-runner lizards have no specialised adaptions that allow them to favour one surface over another and they encounter a wide range of surfaces in their natural homes, Bergmann and Kyle Pettinelli decided to test the lizards\u2019 sprinting prowess on surfaces ranging from 25 \u03bcm fine glass beads and sand to coarse gravel and 4 cm pebbles to find out how this running Jack of all trades adapts to different conditions. Filming the lizards as they scampered along flat sand and gravel runways, Bergmann saw that some lizards were less enthusiastic athletes than others and required more encouragement to pull out their fastest performances. However, when he compared the lizards\u2019 highest speed sprints, they ran fastest on the coarse sand (\u223c1.1 m s \u22121 ), increasing their stride rate rather than taking longer strides, in contrast to the lizards that sprinted on silt and pebbles, which ran at speeds just below 1 m s \u22121 . The lizards also seemed to prefer running on natural surfaces rather than similarly sized smooth glass beads, and rarely recorded speeds of over 0.75 m s \u22121 when running on the glass beads. Wondering why the lizards were more competent on the less uniform natural surfaces, Marian Crockett and Erika Schaper compared the density of the glass beads, sand and gravel, and the stability of the surfaces that they produce, and found that the coarse sand should shift least beneath the lizards\u2019 feet as they sprinted over it. \u2018Substrate particle size affects both how fast the lizards can run on them and how they move\u2019, says Bergmann, who admits that he was surprised that the lizards performed so much better on coarse sand when they were thought to run competently on most surfaces. However, he suspects that the stable and even surface that is provided by the coarse sand may allow the lizards to produce their top performances, \u2018unlike gravel, which makes for a bumpy and uneven surface\u2019. Having shown that particle size matters, even for an animal that does not seem to have any specialised adaptions for one particular surface over another, Bergmann is now keen to discover how sprinting lizards cope on more realistic terrains where sand, silt and gravel are mixed, and how they adapt when running up sand and gravel hills. \u00a9 2017.

However, Aoki and her colleagues had a hunch that pilot whales may buck this trend. While other toothed whales opt for a leisurely low-cost descent and ascent in order to conserve oxygen supplies for use while foraging at depth, short-finned pilot whales have been reported to prefer a fast-dash approach. Intrigued by the seemingly profligate strategy of the short-finned pilot whales, Aoki and Patrick Miller attached depth and motion tags to 18 long-finned pilot whales off the coast of Norway to learn more about the animals\u2019 antics beneath the waves. Recording over 150 h of data and analysing 140 dives exceeding 250 m, Aoki and colleagues found that, on average, the whales reached depths of 444 m in dives lasting approximately 9 min, with one whale descending 617 m and the longest dive lasting over 13.5 min. And when the team calculated the average speed of the whales\u2019 ascent, Aoki and her colleagues were surprised that it was significantly higher (2.7 m s \u22121 ) than the expected speed (1.2\u20131.5 m s \u22121 based on the animals\u2019 estimated masses). Wondering whether the whales were taking advantage of a slick skin to accelerate their rapid ascent or were swimming particularly hard, the team calculated the whales\u2019 drag coefficient and found that it was no different from that of other species: the whales must be swimming harder and consuming more energy during their ascent. In addition, the team noticed that the whales\u2019 ascent slowed as they became increasingly buoyant near the end of their return to the surface, slightly reducing their most efficient swimming speed. \u2018Our results indicate that long-finned pilot whales maintain high diving metabolic rates during deep foraging dives\u2019, says Aoki, who suggests that animals might be using a \u2018spend more, gain more\u2019 hunting strategy, where they expend more energy swimming faster in order to consume more calories than other cetacean species. \u00a9 2017.

She received her Bachelor's degree in Marine Biology and her Master\u2019s degree from the University of West Florida, USA. Rummer then moved to the University of British Columbia, Canada, for her PhD in Zoology with Colin Brauner, after which she completed a short postdoc with Dave Randall at the City University of Hong Kong. She has been recognised with a L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO For Women in Science Fellowship and was one of the Australia Broadcasting Corporation's Top Five Scientists under 40 in 2016. Where did you go to university and how did you choose the subject that you studied? I stayed in my hometown for my first two years of university. Initially, I studied at a small college, Lincoln Land College in Springfield, Illinois, and I earned an Associate's Degree in Biology knowing that I was going to go on to a bigger university. Staying in Springfield was great, because I could live at home, keep a part-time job waiting tables, and save a lot of money. All the cool kids were going away to university, living in dorms and going to parties, but I did really well in my first two years of university. I also connected with one of my biology professors, Warren Martin, who organised a field course on the coral reefs in Jamaica, and I was invited along. I had gone to the ocean with my parents on holiday when I was 8, but this trip was my first fieldwork experience and my first field trip to a coral reef. While looking at sea urchin populations and coral reef fishes, I decided marine biology was my path, so I started looking into transferring to the University of West Florida, USA, to finish my Bachelor's degree. Back then, the University of West Florida was one of the few institutions with an undergraduate degree in marine biology. It was right on the coast, so we had estuaries, wetlands and marine ecosystems to study during weekly field trips: basically a lot of our laboratory experiences were in the field. That is when I learned that I loved physiology \u2013 it is a combination of all of the sciences that I really like, including math \u2013 and I had really cool comparative physiology and ecological physiology classes, which solidified my career path. I remember learning about fish and thinking, \u2018There are so many species and they are all doing different things\u2019, so fish physiology was where I started focusing. I also got to do some small research projects and to work with some of the graduate students, so I got a taste of real research right away. Can you tell us about your career progression through graduate school? I had already done a couple of projects on the coral reef ecosystems in the Dry Tortugas National Park, southwest of the Florida Keys, doing some high temperature and low oxygen studies on fish, but I was really interested in working on oxygen transport in fish. Fish have an amazing capacity for transporting oxygen and delivering it to tissues and they also use it to control buoyancy. My Master's research with Wayne Bennett at the University of West Florida looked at oxygen delivery in fish, but in a very applied way because they use that mechanism to fill and empty the swim bladder. However, this buoyancy mechanism can be detrimental for catch and release fisheries. When a fish is brought up very quickly from depth, the swim bladder can over expand and compress the internal organs, causing a lot of damage; when the fish is subsequently released, it can suffer injuries and may not survive. That was my first taste of conservation physiology. The Master's project worked out well for me because the mechanism that I was studying was also of interest to Colin Brauner at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. We put some ideas together for a PhD and I started with Colin in June 2004. That was a really big move for me. I became part of the UBC community, which is still important to me. It has shaped my career and a lot of the research that I do now was sparked by the work that I did with Colin. Toward the end of my PhD, I also did some work with Dave Randall, who was Colin's PhD supervisor. I didn't have a postdoc lined up and he said, \u2018Why don't you come and do a fellowship with me for a year in Hong Kong?\u2019 I spent a little under a year with him, which was great. I had a lot of freedom to explore additional ideas that I had had after finishing my PhD. Dave has been an important mentor of mine. Why did you move to Australia for your first research position? After deciding to go to Dave's lab for my postdoc and while I was still in Vancouver, G\u00f6ran Nilsson came to UBC to give a seminar. A bunch of us went out to dinner and he asked me about my next step. I told him that I wanted to combine the mechanistic physiology that I had done during my PhD with the coral reef fish research from my Master's and he told me about Phil Munday at James Cook University, Australia. The next morning, I googled Phil and when I got the courage to email him, he responded immediately: G\u00f6ran had just emailed Phil and told him that he thought it would be great if we could collaborate. So, during my time in Hong Kong, I interviewed for an Australian Research Council Super Science Fellowship (the equivalent of an Assistant Professor position) and I got it. I started my 3-year position at James Cook University in August 2011. During that time I was able to build my own research programme and lab \u2013 literally from an empty room with just a \u221280\u00b0C freezer \u2013 with a lot of freedom and autonomy. I worked with Phil quite a bit, and we started co-supervising some Honour's and PhD students. In my mind, I was going to get the most out of the 3-year position, build collaborations and let the experience catalyse my career. I thought that my wife, Kim, and I would be moving back to North America at some point, so I kept an eye out for faculty positions and interviewed for a few. But then I was promoted at James Cook and encouraged to apply for another fellowship, a Discovery Fellowship, to stay. Currently I am finishing that fellowship and have been offered a permanent position at the university as an Associate Professor. In 2015 you were awarded a L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO For Women in Science Fellowship; can you tell us about the scheme and your experience? The L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO For Women in Science Fellowships are designed to catalyse something in a female scientist's career, such as a research project or organising a conference or a workshop. In France, L'Or\u00e9al is the most famous and oldest cosmetic company and, maybe 20 years ago, the senior management realised that they had a lot of scientists working for the company, but they were not holding on to their female scientists and they did not know what the problem was. So, in 2000, they teamed up with UNESCO to do something about it. They decided to raise the visibility of women in science and offer a fellowship programme to highlight their careers at the early- to mid-career transition point where we seem to lose them. In the year that I won, I was one of three from Australia, but it is a global award and there are about 200 recipients annually across the world. The more that I learned about the programme, the more I appreciated it and respected what it does. They decided to raise the visibility of women in science and offer a fellowship programme to highlight their careers at the early- to mid-career transition point where we seem to lose them I used the money to catalyse my shark work in French Polynesia, which is now in its fourth year and is another example of a combination of physiology with a big conservation problem. The aquatic conditions in the shallow water nursery areas around the island of Moorea are really challenging. The sharks are born and reside there for several months in the summer when the water conditions are most challenging. They have to grow, swim, eat and avoid predators, but they may be caught accidentally in the fisheries and conditions are getting worse because of climate change, other anthropogenic stressors and increases in the island's human population. I started this project to try to understand the physiological limits of these baby sharks and how we can predict what ongoing and future conditions might do to shark populations in French Polynesia. The L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO fellowship catalysed the project and it continues to be a huge part of my ongoing research programme. How does an understanding of physiology empower conservation? In some cases, physiological data can tell us which areas we need to designate as \u2018off limits\u2019 for development, boat traffic, etc. For example, some of our work in Moorea has shown that jet skis are really stressful to spotted eagle rays. They are already stressed from other factors due to climate change, so let's avoid extra stressors. Conservation physiology helps us to identify what the limits of an animal are so that we can alleviate any other stressors and maybe start to look at larger scale changes that can be made to these areas to prevent them from getting extra disturbances. For example, if the water is shallow, let's maintain the natural mangroves that protect these coastal areas from storm surges and other stressors. French Polynesia is off limits for shark fishing but it still happens, so knowing that it takes a shark at least 4 h to recover \u2013 perhaps even longer if the water is warm \u2013 allows us to raise awareness with local communities. Conservation physiology helps us to identify what the limits of an animal are so that we can alleviate any other stressors How has the JEB Travelling Fellowship scheme helped to develop your career? I have received two and I used the most recent one for research at Lizard Island Research Station in the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef to understand local adaptation in fish populations. The Great Barrier Reef is 2300 km long and spans a latitudinal gradient, so there are species that live close to the equator in the north and further from the equator in the more southern regions of the reef. From these distinct populations we can learn what the warmer water populations might be doing that is different from the cooler water populations to help us to understand what might happen to them as the climate changes. Could we see geographical redistributions of these populations to more forgiving thermal habitats? That fellowship catalysed a lot of the work that I have been able to do at Lizard Island. I have gone back almost every year since, sent students, and we have produced some amazing papers out of that research facility. That fellowship catalysed a lot of the work that I have been able to do How do you use social media to promote science? I use social media to give scientists a face and voice, to show what it means to be a scientist today: what we get up to, how we cope with today's challenges \u2013 from an academic perspective, but also from a political perspective, raising visibility. Social media is also great for networking: I have made amazing connections through it and formed a lot of collaborations. I have also made connections with the media in general through social media to raise awareness of my research with the general public. I believe that science is not just for scientists, it is for everyone. Taxpayers pay for science, so they deserve to know what we are up to and what we are discovering in a way that is accessible to them. I use social media to give scientists a face and voice, to show what it means to be a scientist today You wrote for Outside JEB when you were a graduate student; how did that experience contribute to your development? I learned so much when I was writing for Outside JEB. It was hard, but it shaped a lot of the way in which I communicate science today. The experience also allowed me to launch the new Conservation Physiology in Action section in Conservation Physiology, so now I am an editor training young writers and teaching them how to tell the story. As an editor of an Open Access journal and an Editorial Board member of another, what are your views on Open Access publication? I think that the journal model is starting to change, but we still have a way to go. I believe that scientific information should be freely available, probably now more than ever with climate change. A lot of my work is based on coral reef ecosystems around small island nations that depend heavily on the health of their reefs for ecotourism and food. Island communities don't usually have access to high profile journals where our work is published, so they are not getting the scientific information that they need. I try to publish my research Open Access, but it is so expensive, so I have to trade off whether I can afford the cost. Publishing Open Access gives hope that the people that need the information will be able to obtain it. But even if a paper is published Open Access, the end users may not be able to read it and understand how the information is valuable, so it is also important to issue press releases and engage with social media to get information out to the general public and stakeholders, so that it can be used in a meaningful and dynamic way. Can you tell us about your experiences of living and working in other countries where you have dealt with the immigration system? Dealing with the immigration systems in Hong Kong and Canada was pretty easy. Kim and I were both granted permanent residency in Australia within months of moving here and we are working on our citizenship right now, but that has been a challenge for me. Australia has two rules when you are applying for citizenship. The first is that you cannot have been away from the country for more than 90 days in the past year, which I have because I travel a lot with my research. Also, you can't have been out of the country for more than a year in the past 4 years, which I have. Initially, the authorities said that I would have to wait until I could satisfy the requirement, but my answer was \u2018Until when? Do I just stop travelling?\u2019 This has been a challenging problem to resolve, as I have to travel. I have provided letters of support stating that I travel for work and confirming that I am not living in other countries, which we hope will resolve the problem. What has been the most exciting moment in your career to date? Publishing in Science was pretty amazing; it was a dream but I never expected it to happen. The entire issue was about oxygen delivery. Other colleagues, including Michael Berenbrink and Roy Weber, had papers in the same issue; it was a real win for comparative physiology. Winning the L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO award was also very exciting. The company made videos about our research, they had big screens at the presentation and produced huge posters about us; it was quite humbling. We also had the full wardrobe and make-up treatment. It was like being a rock star. What has been your experience of working with the media? I enjoy it, and I always learn a lot from the experience. Last year I was recognised as one of Australia's Top Five Scientists under 40 by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Radio National (RN). Part of that prize was to go to work with the ABC/RN for 2 weeks and to learn from the best science presenters and journalists. We were their scientists in residence, so we also gave them stories \u2013 not only our own research but I also had a couple of colleagues that were coming out with amazing studies at the time, so I was able to bring them in too. In return, we learned about broadcasting technology and the most effective ways that we can talk about science. What do you most like doing outside of the lab? I enjoy practising yoga, running, climbing \u2013 mountains and in the gym \u2013 eating good food and enjoying wine with friends. I co-own a climbing gym in Townsville with Kim and a couple of other people. It's a full-time job for Kim. She is their programme director and organises all of the kids\u2019 programmes. Kim is also the coach for the local and national climbing teams, which compete nationally and on an international basis. They are planning for the 2020 Olympics in Japan, which is very exciting. Regarding the gym, I joke that I am the silent partner, but I put in my two cents when I can. FOOTNOTES Jodie Rummer was interviewed by Kathryn Knight.

Alternating movements of contralateral limbs are also typical during swimming gaits for most freshwater turtles. Here, we report a novel gait in turtles, in which the pleurodire Emydura subglobosa swims using a bounding gait that coordinates bilateral protraction of both forelimbs with bilateral retraction of both hindlimbs. Use of this bounding gait is correlated with increased limb excursion and decreased stride frequency, but not increased velocity when compared with standard swimming strokes. Bounding by E. subglobosa provides a second example of a non-mammalian lineage that can use bounding gaits, and may give insight into the evolution of aquatic flapping. Parallels in limb muscle fascicle properties between bounding turtles and crocodylids suggest a possible musculoskeletal mechanism underlying the use of bounding gaits in particular lineages.

Deer mice from high- and low-altitude populations were born and raised in captivity to adulthood, and then acclimated to normoxia or hypobaric hypoxia (simulating hypoxia at \u223c4300\u2005m). Thermogenic capacity [maximal O 2 consumption ( V\u0307 O 2 ,max ), during cold exposure] was measured in hypoxia, along with arterial O 2 saturation ( S a O 2 ) and heart rate ( f H ). Hypoxia acclimation increased V\u0307 O 2 ,max by a greater magnitude in highlanders than in lowlanders. Highlanders also had higher S a O 2 and extracted more O 2 from the blood per heartbeat (O 2 pulse= V\u0307 O 2 ,max / f H ). Hypoxia acclimation increased f H , O 2 pulse and capillary density in the left ventricle of the heart. Our results suggest that adaptive increases in thermogenic capacity involve integrated functional changes across the O 2 cascade that augment O 2 circulation and extraction from the blood.

Given this evolutionary history of minimal gravitational loading of fishes in water, it has been hypothesized that weight-responsive musculoskeletal systems evolved during the tetrapod invasion of land and are thus absent in fishes. Amphibious fishes, however, experience increased effective weight when out of water \u2013 are these fishes responsive to gravitational loading? Contrary to the tetrapod-origin hypothesis, we found that terrestrial acclimation reversibly increased gill arch stiffness (\u223c60% increase) in the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus when loaded normally by gravity, but not under simulated microgravity. Quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that this change in mechanical properties occurred via increased abundance of proteins responsible for bone mineralization in other fishes as well as in tetrapods. Type X collagen, associated with endochondral bone growth, increased in abundance almost ninefold after terrestrial acclimation. Collagen isoforms known to promote extracellular matrix cross-linking and cause tissue stiffening, such as types IX and XII collagen, also increased in abundance. Finally, more densely packed collagen fibrils in both gill arches and filaments were observed microscopically in terrestrially acclimated fish. Our results demonstrate that the mechanical properties of the fish musculoskeletal system can be fine-tuned in response to changes in effective body weight using biochemical pathways similar to those in mammals, suggesting that weight sensing is an ancestral vertebrate trait rather than a tetrapod innovation.

Donatelli PDF ABSTRACT Fish live in a complex world and must actively adapt their swimming behavior to a range of environments. Most studies of swimming kinematics focus on two-dimensional properties related to the bending wave that passes from head to tail. However, fish also twist their bodies three dimensionally around their longitudinal axis as the bending wave passes down the body. We measured and characterized this movement, which we call \u2018wobble\u2019, in six species of elongate fishes ( Anoplarchus insignis , Xiphister mucosus , Lumpenus sagitta , Pholis laeta , Apodichthys flavidus and Ronquilus jordani ) from three different habitats (intertidal, nearshore and subtidal) using custom video analysis software. Wobble and bending are synchronized, with a phase shift between the wobble wave and bending wave. We found that species from the same habitats swim in similar ways, even if they are more closely related to species from different habitats. In nearshore species, the tail wobbles the most but, in subtidal and intertidal species, the head wobbles more than or the same as the tail. We also wanted to understand the relationship between wobble and the passive mechanics of the fish bodies. Therefore, we measured torsional stiffness and modulus along the body and found that modulus increases from head to tail in all six species. As wobble does not correlate with the passive properties of the body, it may play a different role in swimming behavior of fishes from different habitats.

However, studies investigating the impact of such structures on locomotory costs have produced inconsistent results. Male fiddler crabs possess a large sexually selected claw and are ideal for assessing the impact of a sexually selected trait on the cost of locomotion. Here, we measured the energy expenditure of clawed, declawed and artificially loaded crabs during sustained exercise by measuring oxygen consumption and blood lactate levels. We also measured blood lactate levels of clawed and declawed crabs following a sprint and forced walk to assess energy expenditure during non-sustainable, strenuous locomotion. Clawed and declawed crabs consumed the same amount of oxygen and had the same blood lactate concentration during sustained locomotion, suggesting that the large claw does not increase energetic costs during sustainable locomotion. Following non-sustainable, strenuous locomotion, however, there was a trend for clawed crabs to have higher concentrations of lactate in their blood than declawed crabs, suggesting that bearing a large claw may increase energetic costs during strenuous locomotion and lengthen recovery time. Artificially loaded crabs produced more lactic acid than clawed and declawed crabs during sustainable locomotion, suggesting that compensatory traits help mitigate the energetic cost of carrying the large claw. Overall, our results show that the impact of exaggerated structures on energy expenditure may depend on exercise intensity and highlight the need to examine various locomotory intensities when attempting to assess the costs of bearing a sexually selected trait.

Whilst airborne, flying organisms face unavoidable wing wear and wing area loss. Many studies have tried to quantify the consequences of wing area loss to flight performance with varied results, suggesting that not all types of damage are equal and different species may have different means to compensate for some forms of wing damage with little to no cost. Here, we investigated the cost of control during hovering flight with damaged wings, specifically wings with asymmetric and symmetric reductions in area, by measuring maximum load lifting capacity and the metabolic power of hovering flight in hawkmoths ( Manduca sexta ). We found that while asymmetric and symmetric reductions are both costly in terms of maximum load lifting and hovering efficiency, asymmetric reductions are approximately twice as costly in terms of wing area lost. The moths also did not modulate flapping frequency and amplitude as predicted by a hovering flight model, suggesting that the ability to do so, possibly tied to asynchronous versus synchronous flight muscles, underlies the varied responses found in different wing clipping experiments.

Two occludin isoforms (designated Ocln and Ocln-a) and a tricellulin (Tric) were identified. Transcripts encoding ocln , ocln-a and tric were broadly expressed in larval lamprey, with the greatest abundance of ocln in the gut, liver and kidney, ocln-a in the gill and skin, and tric in the kidney. Ocln and Ocln-a resolved as \u223c63\u2005kDa and \u223c35\u2005kDa MW proteins, respectively, while Tric resolved as a \u223c50\u2005kDa protein. Ocln immunolocalized to the gill vasculature and in gill mucous cells while Ocln-a localized to the gill pouch and gill epithelium. Both Ocln and Ocln-a localized in the nephron, the epidermis and the luminal side of the gut. In branchial tissue, Tric exhibited punctate localization, consistent with its presence at regions of tricellular contact. Following ion-poor water (IPW) acclimation of ammocoetes, serum [Na + ] and [Cl \u2212 ] decreased, but not [Ca 2+ ], and carcass moisture content increased. In association, Ocln abundance increased in the skin and kidney, but reduced in the gill of IPW-acclimated ammocoetes while Ocln-a abundance reduced in the kidney only. Tric abundance increased in the gill. Region-specific alterations in ocln , ocln-a and tric mRNA abundance were also observed in the gut. Data support a role for Ocln, Ocln-a and Tric in the osmoregulatory strategies of a basal vertebrate. FOOTNOTES The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

Here, the possible induction of an immune response by long dsRNA was tested in a marine bivalve ( Crassostrea gigas ), as well as the specific role of the subunit 2 of the nuclear factor \u03baB inhibitor ( I\u03baB2 ). This gene is a candidate of particular interest for functional investigations in the context of oyster mass mortality events, as Cg-I\u03baB2 mRNA levels exhibited significant variation depending on the amount of ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) DNA detected. In the present study, dsRNAs targeting Cg-I\u03baB2 and green fluorescent protein genes were injected in vivo into oysters before being challenged by OsHV-1. Survival appeared close to 100% in both dsRNA-injected conditions associated with a low detection of viral DNA and a low expression of a panel of 39 OsHV-1 genes as compared with infected control. Long dsRNA molecules, both Cg-I\u03baB2- and GFP-dsRNA, may have induced an anti-viral state controlling the OsHV-1 replication and precluding the understanding of the specific role of Cg-I\u03baB2 . Immune-related genes including Cg-I\u03baB1 , Cg-Rel1 , Cg-IFI44 , Cg-PKR and Cg-IAP appeared activated in the dsRNA-injected condition, potentially hampering viral replication and thus conferring a better resistance to OsHV-1 infection. We revealed that long dsRNA-mediated genetic interference triggered an anti-viral state in the oyster, emphasizing the need for new reverse genetics tools for assessing immune gene function and avoiding off-target effects in bivalves.

The present study investigated whether hypoxia exposure [for 24\u2005h: 2.5\u2005mg\u2005O 2 l \u22121 (20% dissolved O 2 )] during the embryonic stage alone (hypoxic history) or combined with a 5-day high-carbohydrate (60%) diet stimulus at first feeding (HC dietary history) can affect glucose metabolism later in life, i.e. in juvenile fish. After 19\u2005weeks of growth, we observed a decrease in final body mass in fish with an HC dietary history. Feed efficiency was significantly affected by both hypoxic and HC dietary histories. After a short challenge test (5\u2005days) performed with a 30% carbohydrate diet in juvenile trout, our results also showed that, in trout that experienced hypoxic history, mRNA levels of gluconeogenic genes in liver and glucose transport genes in both liver and muscle were significantly increased at the juvenile stage. Besides, mRNA levels of glycolytic genes were decreased in fish with an HC dietary history. Both hypoxic and dietary histories barely affected plasma metabolites or global epigenetic modifications in juvenile fish after the challenge test. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that an acute hypoxic stimulus during early development alone or combined with a hyperglucidic stimulus at first feeding can modify growth performance and glucose metabolism at the molecular level in juvenile trout.

We have previously shown that chronic uptake of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid affects the behavior of honey bees in the field. Foraging behavior, homing success, navigation performance and social communication were impaired. Thiacloprid collected at a feeding site at low doses accumulates in foragers over time. Here, we applied a laboratory standard procedure (the proboscis-extension response conditioning) in order to assess which processes, acquisition, memory consolidation and/or memory retrieval were compromised after bees were fed either with thiacloprid or the formulation of thiacloprid named Calypso \u00ae at different sublethal doses. Extinction and generalization tests allowed us to investigate whether bees respond to a learned stimulus, and how selectively. We showed that thiacloprid, as active substance and as formulation, poses a substantial risk to honey bees by disrupting learning and memory functions. These data support and specify the data collected in the field. FOOTNOTES The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

Tag sites can show persistent regional swellings or depressions. Fibroelastic blubber grips a tag, so if muscle shears relative to blubber during locomotion, the tag tip could cavitate the muscle within overall shearing distance. We modeled shearing of blubber relative to muscle, within the dorsal-ventral peduncular movement range of four common dolphin ( Delphinus delphis ) cadavers (mean length 186\u2005cm). The net change in angle and hence tip distance moved was calculated with dorsal and ventral flexion, and compared between 1.5\u2005mm diameter needles inserted into blubber only and through blubber into muscle. The greatest shearing value was 3.6 cm, and shearing was most pronounced in the areas ventral and caudal to the dorsal fin. Scaled dummy tags were also inserted and the animal cyclically flexed dorsally and ventrally for 18\u2005h. Tag sites were dissected and cavities around the tag tips documented. If this shearing is comparable in large whales, depressions and regional swellings observed with intramuscular tracking tags are likely the result of tissue loss and repair, respectively. Placing tags para-sagittally anterior to the dorsal fin would cause the least trauma, but pain from such tags remains a concern. FOOTNOTES The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

This implies a finely tuned interaction with the host immune response in order to avoid infection clearance. Although a number of immune interference mechanisms have been described in nematodes, how parasites adapt to the immune environment provided by their hosts remains largely unexplored. Here, we used the gastrointestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus to investigate the plasticity of life history traits and immunomodulatory mechanisms in response to intestinal inflammation. We adopted an experimental model of induced colitis and exposed worms to intestinal inflammation at two different developmental stages (larvae and adults). We found that H. polygyrus responded to intestinal inflammation by up-regulating the expression of a candidate gene involved in the interference with the host immune response. Worms infecting mice with colitis also had better infectivity (earlier adult emergence in the intestinal lumen and higher survival) compared with worms infecting control hosts, suggesting that H. polygyrus adjusted its life history schedule in response to intestinal inflammation.

Increased physical activity is a widely prescribed method of reducing the detrimental effects of ageing on skeletal muscle contractility. The present study used isometric and work loop testing protocols to uniquely investigate the effects of 8\u2005weeks of voluntary wheel running on the contractile performance of isolated dynapenic soleus and diaphragm muscles of 38-week-old CD1 mice. When compared with untrained controls, voluntary wheel running induced significant improvements in maximal isometric stress and work loop power, a reduced resistance to fatigue, but greater cumulative work during fatiguing work loop contractions in isolated muscle. These differences occurred without appreciable changes in lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase or myosin heavy chain expression synonymous with this form of training in younger rodent models. Despite the given improvement in contractile performance, the average running distance significantly declined over the course of the training period, indicating that this form of training may not be sufficient to fully counteract the longer-term ageing-induced decline in skeletal muscle contractile performance. Although these results indicate that regular low-intensity physical activity may be beneficial in offsetting the age-related decline in skeletal muscle contractility, future work focusing on the maintenance of a healthy body mass with increasing age and its effects on myosin-actin cross-bridge kinetics and Ca 2+ handling is needed to clarify the mechanisms causing the improved contractile performance in trained dynapenic skeletal muscle.

Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) in the hypothalamus has been reported to act as neuroendocrine integrator of photoperiodic cues. In this study, both captive and field investigations were carried out to understand the effects of photoperiod and seasonality on GnIH expression in subtropical tree sparrows. Monthly observations of GnIH mRNA and peptide expression in wild birds over a year revealed a significant increase in GnIH mRNA level and number of GnIH-ir neurons during the non-breeding season when compared with their expression in the breeding season. GnIH-ir neurons were found primarily in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) with their fibers projecting into the median eminence and some other areas of the brain. In an 8 month-long experiment, birds exposed to short days had higher GnIH expression compared with birds exposed to long days regardless of sampling month. Long-day birds with regressed testes had similar GnIH levels to short-day birds. Though the number of GnIH peptide-expressing neurons ran almost parallel to the levels of GnIH mRNA, they were inversely related to gonadal size in both sexes under natural and artificial photoperiodic conditions. These results clearly indicate an inhibitory role of GnIH in photoperiodic regulation of seasonal reproduction in the tree sparrow. FOOTNOTES The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

Muijres PDF ABSTRACT To escape after taking a blood meal, a mosquito must exert forces sufficiently high to take off when carrying a load roughly equal to its body weight, while simultaneously avoiding detection by minimizing tactile signals exerted on the host's skin. We studied this trade-off between escape speed and stealth in the malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii using 3D motion analysis of high-speed stereoscopic videos of mosquito take-offs and aerodynamic modeling. We found that during the push-off phase, mosquitoes enhanced take-off speed using aerodynamic forces generated by the beating wings in addition to leg-based push-off forces, whereby wing forces contributed 61% of the total push-off force. Exchanging leg-derived push-off forces for wing-derived aerodynamic forces allows the animal to reduce peak force production on the host's skin. By slowly extending their long legs throughout the push-off, mosquitoes spread push-off forces over a longer time window than insects with short legs, thereby further reducing peak leg forces. Using this specialized take-off behavior, mosquitoes are capable of reaching take-off speeds comparable to those of similarly sized fruit flies, but with weight-normalized peak leg forces that were only 27% of those of the fruit flies. By limiting peak leg forces, mosquitoes possibly reduce the chance of being detected by the host. The resulting combination of high take-off speed and low tactile signals on the host might help increase the mosquito's success in escaping from blood-hosts, which consequently also increases the chance of transmitting vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, to future hosts. INTRODUCTION To reproduce, a gravid female malaria mosquito needs a blood meal for egg development ( Clements, 2011 ). To acquire this meal, the mosquito must approach a host, feed, and then escape without being detected. Host searching and the bite dynamics of malaria mosquitoes have been well studied ( Clements, 2011 ; Krenn and Asp\u00f6ck, 2012 ; Takken, 1991 ), but little is known about the escape dynamics of blood-feeding insects ( Roitberg et al., 2003 ). A robust strategy for a mosquito to successfully escape from a host would simultaneously comprise a sufficiently high escape speed and a low chance of being detected. Escape speed and consequent survival of blood-fed mosquitoes scale inversely with meal size ( Roitberg et al., 2003 ), thus escape performance is constrained by the blood load carried. Blood loads in fed mosquitoes can double to triple the animals' total weight ( Roitberg et al., 2003 ), and thus despite their reduced escape speed, blood-fed mosquitoes are expected to generate higher push-off forces than unfed individuals. This outcome might increase tactile signaling to the host, potentially reducing mosquito survivability, and consequently the chance that the mosquito transmits pathogens (such as Plasmodium parasites) to future hosts ( Takken and Knols, 1999 ). Mechanosensory hairs of mammals have a mechanical load detection threshold of less than 0.07\u2005mN ( Li et al., 2011 ). This threshold was determined using the von Frey assay, whereby nylon threads with varying thickness are used to test a rodent's sensitivity to mechanical stimulation ( Mogil et al., 2001 ). This type of stimulus can be expected to be similar to the push-off forces produced by the legs of an escaping insect. Therefore, a hematophagous animal escaping from a mammalian host could avoid detection by exerting ground reaction forces below the detection threshold of 0.07\u2005mN. However, such reduction in push-off forces might lead to a decrease in take-off speed, suggesting that there is a trade-off between stealth and speed in post-feeding escape take-offs of hematophagous insects. Fruit flies, which, like mosquitoes, belong to the order Diptera and are similar in mass, use two distinct take-off maneuvers that are controlled by different neural pathways: (1) a slow voluntary take-off and (2) a fast escape in response to looming stimuli ( Card and Dickinson, 2008b ). During slow voluntary take-offs, the fly combines leg-derived push-off forces with wing-derived aerodynamic forces. In contrast, during the fast escape, all forces produced during the initial push-off phase are generated by the middle pair of legs, which are powered by a large specialized tergal depressor of the trochanter (TDT) muscle; no wing motion is involved ( Card and Dickinson, 2008b ). Unlike fruit flies, blood-feeding tsetse flies do not possess this TDT muscle, suggesting that escaping tsetse flies cannot produce the high leg forces found in fruit flies ( King, 1983 ). Blood-feeders such as mosquitoes and tsetse flies might thus reduce the tactile signals transmitted to the skin of their host by exerting low leg push-off forces. Mosquitoes differ from fruit flies and tsetse flies in two important ways that might affect take-off performance: (1) mosquitoes, like other culicids, generally have longer legs than other flies, and (2) mosquitoes use strikingly different wingbeat kinematics than flies. A recent study on the flight dynamics and aerodynamics of Culex mosquitoes ( Bomphrey et al., 2017 ) showed that mosquitoes operate at extremely low wingbeat amplitudes (\u223c40 deg) and high wingbeat frequencies (\u223c700\u2005Hz). To achieve this, mosquitoes make use of specialized aerodynamic mechanisms controlled by spanwise wing rotations, but the functional reason for using these extreme wingbeat kinematics is unknown ( Bomphrey et al., 2017 ). Honeybees, which need to be able to carry large nectar and pollen loads, also use wing kinematics with relatively low stroke amplitudes and high wingbeat frequencies ( Altshuler et al., 2005 ). These kinematics have been shown to be aerodynamically less efficient than the more conventional low-frequency, high-amplitude kinematics typical of fruit flies, but may be related to the large load-carrying capacity required of honeybees ( Altshuler et al., 2005 ), and possibly of mosquitoes. We examine here the take-off and flight dynamics of unfed and blood-fed malaria mosquitoes, Anopheles coluzzii Coetzee & Wilkerson, to determine how flying mosquitoes are capable of taking off while carrying such high blood loads, and what the potential trade-off might be between escape stealth and speed when taking off from a blood host. Using a stereoscopic high-speed camera system ( Fig. 1 A) we filmed the take-off dynamics of 63 malaria mosquitoes ( Fig. 2 , Movies 1\u20134 ), and using computational models we estimated their leg push-off dynamics and wingbeat-based aerodynamics. From \u00b5CT scans of the thorax of a female mosquito, we also reconstructed the 3D morphology of the legs and flight power muscles ( Fig. 1 D). Comparing these results with data from fruit flies ( Card and Dickinson, 2008a , b ) shows that throughout the take-off mosquitoes produce tactile forces on the substrate that are much lower than those produced by fruit flies. In contrast, take-off speeds are surprisingly similar between the mosquitoes and fruit flies. This suggests that mosquitoes have optimized their take-off dynamics to balance the stealth and speed requirements of post-ingestion escape. Download powerpoint Fig. 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental animal Experiments were performed on 5- to 10-day-old female malaria mosquitoes, A. coluzzii , from a laboratory stock kept at Wageningen University, The Netherlands. The colony originates from Liberia in 1987, and are being reared on blood obtained from the blood bank (Sanquin, The Netherlands) using a Hemotek membrane feeding system (Discovery Workshops, Accrington, UK). Because malaria mosquitoes are nocturnally active, they were reared in a clock-shifted 12 h:12\u2005h light:dark cycle, and experiments were performed during the late-night period of the mosquitoes, which coincided with morning office hours. Prior to the experiments, a subset of mosquitoes was blood-fed on a human arm or a Hemotek membrane feeding system. Mosquitoes were then placed in custom storage containers made from a silicone tube and gauze. After an acclimatization period of 10\u201360\u2005min, the take-off experiments were performed. We only used female mosquitoes that did not receive a blood meal prior to the experiments, and were therefore free of malaria parasites ( Clements, 2011 ). For this reason, the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Wageningen University concluded that our experimental procedure did not require ethical approval according to the Dutch \u2018Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act\u2019. Experimental setup and procedure The experimental setup ( Fig. 1 A) consisted of a rectangular enclosure (20\u00d720\u00d730\u2005cm, width\u00d7depth\u00d7height) with transparent acrylic walls. At one corner of the arena was positioned a transparent horizontal take-off platform (3\u00d71\u2005cm, width\u00d7length), and on the opposite corner a damp black cloth functioned as a shelter for the mosquitoes within the brightly lit flight chamber. A single mosquito was placed on the platform directly from its storage container, after which it would take off and fly towards the shelter, land and rest. Because we wanted to compare dynamics of voluntary take-offs and elicited escapes, we tried various types of stimuli to trigger escape take-offs. In sharp contrast to fruit flies ( Card and Dickinson, 2008b ), visual looming stimuli did not robustly trigger escape responses in these mosquitoes, possibly because malaria mosquitoes are active at night, when visual cues may not be as important for detecting danger as they are for insects active during daylight ( Takken, 1991 ). Also, the fact that we used white lights to illuminate the experimental setup might have negatively affected the response dynamics of the mosquitoes to visual stimuli. By contrast, manually tapping the take-off platform with the silicone storage container reliably triggered take-off responses, suggesting that the mosquitoes respond more robustly to substratum vibrations than to visual looming stimuli. Therefore, we used only the tapping technique to trigger escape responses. When a mosquito took off voluntarily or in response to platform vibrations, we manually triggered a high-speed stereoscopic video recording system to film the maneuver. The recording system consisted of three gray-scale (12 bits) high-speed cameras (Photron Fastcam SA-X2 with Nikkor Micro 200\u2005m AF f/4D lenses at aperture F11), operating at a frame rate of 13,500 frames s \u22121 , an exposure time of 1/13,688\u2005s and an image resolution of 1024\u00d71000 pixels. The experimental arena was backlit using LED panels (36 W, 300\u00d7300\u2005m, white light CCT 5000\u20135500\u2005K) such that the mosquitoes were visualized as a dark shadow in front of a bright background. The LED panels increase the temperature in the enclosure, and therefore we used an air conditioning system to blow cooled air around the outside of the flight arena to cool the air inside to 28.5\u00b11.08\u00b0C (mean\u00b1s.d.). During experiments, cameras continuously recorded in end-trigger mode, until the manually triggered signal prompted each camera to store 1.66\u2005s of video data prior to the trigger point. After each experiment, the mosquito was collected and killed. Experiments were performed for 10 consecutive working days. At the start of each experimental day, the camera system was calibrated by imaging a 70\u00d770\u2005mm checkerboard calibration plate (square size 5\u2005mm) placed at two known positions in the field of view of all cameras. Based on these images, we then used a direct linear transformation method for stereoscopic camera calibration ( Hatze, 1988 ). Body mass estimation We estimated body mass of each experimental animal (blood-fed and unfed) based on their thoraco-abdominal longitudinal length and maximum abdominal width, which we estimated from the videography images. For this, we first correlated body dimensions with body mass based on a separate set of measurements on 44 female malaria mosquitoes from the same population as the experimental animals. Each mosquito was placed in a rectangular test tube, photographed from the dorsal view and weighed using an analytical balance (Mettler Toledo AG204). We then blood-fed the same mosquito and repeated the size and mass measurements. From each photograph, we measured the longitudinal length of the thorax plus abdomen ( l ) and the maximum abdomen width ( w ), whereby image pixel size was calibrated based on the known size of the test tube. From these measurements, we calculated the volumetric parameter: (1) which represents a cylindrical volume with length equal to the thoraco-abdominal length l and diameter equal to the maximum abdominal width w . Body mass m (in mg) was then correlated with V cy linder (in mm 3 ) using the linear fit ( Fig. S1 ): (2) whereby a and b are the linear fit coefficients [ a =0.501 (0.447 0.555); b =0.827 (0.680 0.973), mean (95% confidence interval), r 2 =0.826]. This fit was used to estimate body mass from measured body dimensions in our experiments. For every take-off sequence, we selected a top-view video image in which the mosquito body was positioned as horizontally as possible. This video image was then calibrated using the corresponding image of the calibration checkerboard, after which the mosquito's thoraco-abdominal longitudinal length l and maximum abdominal width w were determined. From these measurements, we estimated body mass using the aforementioned linear fit between cylindrical volume and body mass ( Fig. S1 , Fig. 1 C). We then determined the animal's mass ratio as: (3) where m unfed is the mean mass of all unfed experimental mosquitoes. Analyzing body and wing movements throughout the take-off We used a combination of automatic and manual tracking to determine body and wingbeat kinematics throughout the take-off maneuvers of blood-fed and unfed mosquitoes. The automatic tracker was an adaptation of a machine-vision-based tracker developed for studying flight dynamics of fruit flies ( Fontaine et al., 2009 ). For this adaptation, we developed a new wing geometry model, a new wing movement model and two new body geometry models (one for a blood-fed mosquito and another for an unfed mosquito) ( Movies 5 and 6 ). The wing model was based on cubic smoothing spline fits of the outline of 20 female mosquito wings. The wing movement model was made by manually tracking three consecutive wingbeats of both a blood-fed and an unfed mosquito in free flight ( Fontaine et al., 2009 ). The automatic tracker performance was poor when tracking initial wing movements at the start of the take-off, and therefore we used a manual tracker to determine wing positions during this phase of the take-off ( Fontaine et al., 2009 ). At each consecutive video frame, both trackers provided us with a time stamp t , a body position ( X ={ x , y , z }) and orientation (expressed by a body quaternion q b ) in the global reference frame, and the angular orientations of the wings within the body reference frame (expressed as quaternions q L and q R for the left and right wing, respectively) ( Fontaine et al., 2009 ). The z -axis of the global reference coordinate system was oriented vertically upwards, and the origin of the coordinate system was set at the body position at the start of the maneuver ( X start ={0,0,0}), defined as the moment that the mosquito started moving its wings. Maneuvers were aligned in time such that lift-off occurred at t =0\u2005s, whereby lift-off was defined as the point in time when the last leg left the platform. We then separated each take-off maneuver into a push-off phase ( t <0\u2005s) and a flight phase ( t >0\u2005s). The body positions throughout each take-off sequence were post-processed using a linear Kalman filter ( Muijres et al., 2014 ), which provided us with the time series of body position X ( t ), velocity U ( t ) and acceleration vectors a ( t ). From the body positions, we determined the body-length-normalized displacements at lift-off, X lift-off / l body , whereby l body is body length. From the velocity vectors, we determined flight speed U ( t ), ascent angle \u03b3( t ) and flight heading through time ( Fig. 3 C). From the body accelerations and the gravitational acceleration vector ( g ={0,0,g}), we determined the weight-normalized external forces on the animal as: (4) Download powerpoint Fig. 3.

(G\u2013J) Effect of body mass on speed and ascent angle at lift-off (G,H), and average normalized force during the push-off phase and aerial phase (I and J, respectively). In A, B and G\u2013J, data for each mosquito are color-coded by mass ratio R m , as indicated by the color bar in B. By multiplying F / mg with the mass ratio of the animal, we determined the unfed-weight normalized external force on the animal as: (5) The first parameter ( F / mg ) indicates the amount of g -force that an animal produced throughout the take-off, whereas the second parameter ( F / mg unfed ) shows how forces varied with both body acceleration and the weight increase as a result of blood feeding. Body orientations ( q b ) were post-processed using an extended Kalman filter ( Muijres et al., 2014 ), and were converted into body pitch angle \u03b2 and body orientation angle \u03c8 throughout the take-off ( Fig. 3 E). The quaternions of wing orientation ( q L and q R ) were Kalman filtered and converted into the three Euler angles within the stroke-plane reference frame ( Fig. 1 B) ( Muijres et al., 2014 ): stroke angle \u03c6( t ), deviation angle \u03b8( t ) and wing rotation angle \u03b7( t ). The stroke-plane reference frame was fixed relative to the body at a 47.5 deg pitch-down angle with respect to the longitudinal body axis. Like fruit flies ( Muijres et al., 2014 ), steadily flying unfed mosquitoes have a body pitch angle of approximately 47.5 deg, and thus for steady flight the stroke plane defined here is oriented nearly horizontally. Note that blood-fed mosquitoes and unfed mosquitoes during take-off maneuvers can operate at very different body angles ( Fig. 3 E). Based on the stroke angle, we separated each flight sequence into separate wingbeats, whereby the start of each wingbeat is defined as the moment at which the stroke angle is maximal (the wing is positioned at its dorsal extreme, Fig. 1 B). Each wingbeat was then divided into a downstroke and an upstroke, whereby the former is defined as a wing movement from the dorsal to the ventral side of the body, and the latter proceeds in the opposite direction. Note that during steady flight, when the stroke plane is oriented horizontally, these are actually forward and backward wing movements, but to remain consistent with existing literature, we termed them downstroke and upstroke, respectively. For each wingbeat, we determined the flapping frequency f =1/\u0394 t , where \u0394 t is the time window between the start of two consecutive wingbeats. Stroke amplitude was defined as A stroke =\u03c6 max \u2013\u03c6 min , and wing rotation amplitude was defined as A rotation =\u03b7 max \u2013\u03b7 min . To study the effect of changes in body pitch on the wingbeat kinematics, we defined the stroke-plane pitch angle adjustment as the difference in pitch angle between the real stroke plane and the body-fixed stroke-plane reference frame ( Fig. 1 B). The real stroke plane is the curved surface that follows the wing tip path throughout the wingbeat ( Fig. 4 K). Thus, the adjustment of the stroke-plane pitch angle is calculated by: (6) where A deviation is the deviation angle amplitude, defined as the difference between the deviation angle at the start of the downstroke and at the start of the upstroke ( Fig. 4 B,K).

(M) Wingbeat-averaged vertical force production for a series of steadily flying hypothetical mosquitoes with a range of blood loads (expressed by F z /mg unfed ), and whereby we systematically replaced steady flight wingbeat parameters with that of their modified kinematics (Eqn 9). Modeling aerodynamic force production based on wingbeat kinematics Based on the measured wing morphology and wingbeat kinematics, we modeled the aerodynamics of the take-off maneuvers using a computational quasi-steady blade-element aerodynamic model that simulates both translational and rotational aerodynamic forces generated by flapping insect wings ( Muijres et al., 2014 ; Sane and Dickinson, 2002 ). For this, we divided the mosquito wing into 20 spanwise segments, and each wingbeat into 200 time steps. For each combination of wing segment and time step, we calculated the angle of attack, translational velocity and rotational velocity (i.e. the rotational angle flux). Based on the chord length, wing velocity and angle of attack of each wing section and time segment, we calculated its lift and drag production using the translational force model; based on chord length, the translational velocity and the angular velocity about the wing rotation axis, we determined rotational lift production. For the model, we used the functions of lift and drag coefficients versus angle of attack [ C L (\u03b1) and C D (\u03b1), respectively] and the rotational lift coefficients ( C rot =1.55) determined using a robotic insect wing model, as mosquitoes operate at a Reynolds number similar to that used in the robot ( Sane and Dickinson, 2002 ). This quasi-steady model captures aerodynamic force production remarkably well in flapping fruit fly wings ( Dickinson and Muijres, 2016 ; Sane and Dickinson, 2002 ), but it does not simulate unsteady aerodynamic effects, such as wake capture, added mass or the trailing-edge vortex lift that was recently identified as an important lift generator in flying mosquitoes ( Bomphrey et al., 2017 ). This recent study on the aerodynamics of male Culex mosquitoes also developed a quasi-steady aerodynamic model ( Bomphrey et al., 2017 ). This model produced different estimates for C L (\u03b1) and C D (\u03b1), which might be because it is based on computational fluid dynamics simulations rather than robotic model experiments, or (more likely) because it was based on simulations of high-aspect ratio mosquito wings. Analyzing time-derived kinematics and force dynamics throughout the take-off During the push-off phase of the take-off maneuver ( t< 0\u2005s), mosquitoes can combine leg-derived push-off forces with wing-derived aerodynamic forces, whereas during the flight phase of the maneuver ( t >0\u2005s), wingbeat-averaged external forces consist only of aerodynamic forces, primarily produced by the beating wings. To estimate the relative contribution of these forces, we analyzed the time-derived kinematics and force dynamics throughout the take-off maneuver in detail ( Fig. 5 ). Because this required labor-intensive manual tracking, we performed this analysis on a random subset of eight blood-fed and eight unfed mosquitoes. For each mosquito, we estimated aerodynamic forces throughout the take-off ( F aero ) using our aerodynamic model, and total forces were calculated from body accelerations ( F total , Eqns 4\u20135). During the flight phase of the maneuver ( t >0\u2005s), total forces and aerodynamic forces should be equal, whereas during the push-off phase ( t <0\u2005s), the difference between total force and aerodynamic force should be equal to the leg-induced forces ( F leg = F total \u2013F aero ). To compare aerodynamic forces with total forces, we calculated the wingbeat-average aerodynamic forces using a low-pass Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency half that of the mean wingbeat frequency of our mosquitoes. For each tested mosquito, we then calculated the ratio between the mean aerodynamic forces and leg force throughout the push-off phase as F aero / F leg . Download powerpoint Fig. 5.

Statistical aerodynamic force control model for blood-load-carrying mosquitoes We studied how mosquitoes change their wing movement pattern and aerodynamic force production to carry a blood load. For this, we focused on the flight phase of the take-off because wingbeat-averaged aerodynamic forces in this case should equal forces estimated from body accelerations. We used two complementary approaches. First, for each wingbeat-tracked mosquito, we determined the average stroke amplitude, wing rotation amplitude, stroke-plane pitch adjustment angle and wingbeat frequency throughout the flight maneuver. And we correlated these parameters with the average unfed-weight normalized aerodynamic force produced during the flight phase ( F / mg unfed ; Eqns 4, 5). Second, to more systematically determine how the changes in wingbeat kinematics affect aerodynamic force production, we used an analysis method similar to that used to study evasive dynamics of free-flying fruit flies ( Muijres et al., 2014 ). We first parsed the complete dataset of free-flight tracked wingbeats into three subsets: wingbeats of blood-fed mosquitoes, wingbeats of unfed mosquitoes flying steadily and wingbeats of unfed mosquitoes when maneuvering. Wingbeats were characterized as steady when wingbeat-averaged body accelerations were less than 0.25 g , where g is gravitational acceleration ( Muijres et al., 2014 ). By fitting a Fourier series through the subset of all unfed steady-flight wingbeats, we determined the average wingbeat kinematics of a steadily flying unfed malaria mosquitoes. The Fourier series were fitted using a Levenberg\u2013Marquardt algorithm, and are defined as: (7) where k steady is the steady-flight wing kinematics variable (\u03c6 steady , \u03b8 steady or \u03b7 steady ), \u03c4 is normalized time (\u03c4= ft ), and a n and b n are the coefficients of the n th order Fourier series. For the stroke angle, we fitted a fourth order Fourier series, whereas for the deviation and rotation angles we fitted a sixth order series because of higher harmonics in their temporal dynamics. Based on the dataset of wingbeats tracked from blood-fed mosquitoes, we determined how mosquitoes adjust their wing movement in order to carry the extra load of a blood meal. For this, we used a linear model that correlated changes in wingbeat kinematics (with respect to the above-derived steady kinematics, k steady ) with changes in force production (relative to steady flight force production, F / mg unfed,steady ). Thus, for every kinematics parameter k =\u03c6, \u03b8 or \u03b7 of wingbeat number i , we calculated the wing kinematic modification: (8) We determined the average modification parameters (MOD k ) for each kinematics variable k by fitting sixth order Fourier series through the temporal distributions of the complete mod k,i dataset (Eqn 7). From the resulting set of modification parameters (MOD \u03c6 , MOD \u03b8 , MOD \u03b7 ), we then could reproduce the set of wingbeat kinematics that a hypothetical mosquito would generate to carry its body weight plus a blood load with a combined normalized weight of F / mg unfed , from: (9) Using this model, we derived wing kinematics of nine hypothetical mosquitoes carrying a load of \u221225% to 175% of the average blood load of all fed mosquitoes (with a step size of 25%). Note that a mosquito with a 0% load equals the average unfed mosquito, and at 100% the hypothetical mosquito has a blood load equal to that of the average blood-fed mosquito, and thus this distribution of body masses encompasses the full mass range of our experimental mosquitoes. Based on the wing kinematics of each hypothetical mosquito, we estimated aerodynamic forces using our aerodynamic model, and we also compared the wingbeat-averaged values with the required forces based on body mass and blood load. To determine the effect of the various wingbeat kinematics parameters on aerodynamic force production, we performed a second set of aerodynamic model simulations. For each hypothetical mosquito, we incrementally replaced the steady-flight wingbeat kinematics with its modified kinematics in the following order: first, we ran each case with the full steady kinematics k steady ; second, we allowed each hypothetical mosquito to adjust only the stroke angle; third, deviation angle was also varied; and finally, variations in wing rotation angle were added, resulting in completely modified kinematics (changes in wingbeat frequency were not modeled because these did not change significantly with blood load). For each combination of kinematics and blood load, we calculated the wingbeat-average aerodynamic forces using the quasi-steady aerodynamic model. Statistical analysis of flight dynamics throughout the take-off maneuvers We performed four sets of statistical tests ( Tables S1\u2013S4 ). First, we tested whether take-off dynamics differed significantly between mosquitoes that performed either a voluntary take-off or a take-off triggered by substrate vibrations ( Table S1 ). Because these did not differ significantly from one another ( Table S1 ), we combined voluntary and triggered individuals in all subsequent analyses. Second, we tested the effect of feeding condition (unfed versus blood-fed) on kinematics and force production throughout the take-off ( Table S2 ), and third, on the wingbeat kinematics during the aerial phase of the take-off ( Table S3 ). For the fourth test, we compared the relative contribution of leg-derived push-off forces and wing-derived aerodynamic forces to total force production during the push-off phase of the take-off ( Table S4 ). For all statistical tests, we used a Shapiro\u2013Wilk test to determine whether the different groups were normally distributed. Because the majority of groups were not normally distributed, we used the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U -test for all consecutive statistical tests. We report results both as means\u00b1s.d. and as medians (first quartile \u2013 third quartile) ( Tables S1\u2013S4 ). Leg and flight muscle morphology in malaria mosquitoes Using our mosquitoes, we were unable to trigger those escape responses described in fruit flies, for which 100% of the push-off forces are produced by the middle pair of legs ( Card and Dickinson, 2008b ). Fruit flies perform such escape take-offs in response to visual looming stimuli, as mediated by the giant axon that triggers the large TDT muscle between the middle leg and the top of the thorax ( Card and Dickinson, 2008b ). Tsetse flies have been shown to have lost the giant axon and TDT muscle, and therefore are not thought to be able to perform this dedicated leg-based take-off ( King, 1983 ). We made \u00b5CT scans of the thorax of a female malaria mosquito using the Tomographic Microscopy and Coherent Radiology beamline (TOMCAT) of the Swiss Light Source at the Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland ( Stampanoni et al., 2010 ), from which we reconstructed the 3D morphology of the leg and flight muscles. To prepare the specimen, we used a staining method developed for increasing contrast of non-mineralized tissues ( Metscher, 2009 ). For this, we first fixed the specimen with Bouin solution for 1 day, followed by several rinsing steps with decreasing ethanol concentrations (70%\u201350%\u201330%). After an additional series of rinsing steps with demineralized water with 0.05% Tween \u00ae 20 (VWR Int. BV), the specimen was stained with a 10% IKI (Lugol's iodine) solution. The thorax was preserved in this IKI solution during transportation to the Swiss Light Source. Using the TOMCAT beamline, we scanned the thorax at 18\u2005keV, with an exposure time of 10\u2005\u00b5s at 10 times magnification. The resulting stack of image slices was further processed using the software program for medical image processing and visualization MeVisLab (MeVis Medical Solutions AG, Bremen, Germany), allowing us to individually segment different muscles within the thorax of the mosquito ( Figs 1 D, 6 ). We identified the indirect flight power muscles, the dorso-ventral muscles (DVMs) and the dorso-longitudinal muscles (DLMs), and the extracoxal depressor muscles of the trochanter of the front, middle and hind leg (EDT1, EDT2 and EDT3, respectively). Three-dimensional reconstructions of these muscles were visualized using the medical imaging programs MeVisLab and Meshlab ( Cignoni et al., 2008 ). Note that the EDT2 muscle is homologous to the TDT found in several fly species and used to power escape take-offs ( Card and Dickinson, 2008a , b ). Download powerpoint Fig. 6. Three-dimensional \u00b5CT reconstruction of the muscular system within the left half of the thorax of a female malaria mosquito. The indirect flight power muscles (blue) consist of the dorso-ventral and dorso-longitudinal muscles (DVMs and DLMs, respectively). The leg muscles that mostly power push-off (yellow) are the extracoxal depressor muscles of the trochanter of the front, middle and hind leg (EDT1, EDT2 and EDT3, respectively). Surrounding material that was stained but did not belong to the segmented muscles was visualized in transparent gray. RESULTS Maneuver dynamics throughout the take-off In total, we filmed and analyzed the take-off dynamics of 32 blood-fed and 31 unfed female mosquitoes performing either voluntary (17 blood-fed and 15 unfed individuals) or escape (15 blood-fed and 16 unfed individuals) take-offs from the experimental platform ( Fig. 3 A,B, Movie 7 ; see database S1 in Muijres et al., 2017 ). Based on morphological measurements, we estimated that the blood-fed mosquitoes averaged twice the mass of unfed mosquitoes (ratio of the total mass of blood-fed animals to the mass of unfed animals, R m = m bloodfed / m unfed =1.93\u00b10.32, n =32, where m unfed =1.23\u00b10.08\u2005mg, n =31; Fig. 1 C). Each take-off consisted of a push-off phase and an aerial phase, separated by lift-off ( t =0\u2005s) when the last leg leaves the platform ( Fig. 3 A\u2013F). This occurred in 21%, 57% and 22% of the cases for the front, middle and hind legs, respectively. During the push-off, mosquitoes combined aerodynamic forces produced by the beating wings with push-off forces from the legs to boost body accelerations ( Fig. 2 , Movies 1\u20134 ), yielding the highest forces, accelerations and ascent angles ( Fig. 3 C\u2013F). During the aerial phase, the animal necessarily used only wing-derived aerodynamic forces, which were lower and more constant through time ( Fig. 3 F). None of the calculated take-off parameters differed significantly between voluntary and escape take-offs ( Table S1 ); therefore, we combined the voluntary and triggered individuals in all subsequent analyses. In contrast, most of the take-off parameters did differ between the take-offs of blood-fed and unfed mosquitoes ( Table S2 ): during the push-off phase, unfed mosquitoes attained higher accelerations, speeds and ascent angles than did those carrying the additional load of a blood meal ( Fig. 3 C,D,G,H). Although absolute forces produced during the push-off phase were higher for the blood-fed mosquitoes, the ratio of peak force produced relative to body weight was 2.03 for unfed mosquitoes, but only 1.56 for blood-fed animals ( Fig. 3 F,I, Table S2 ). In contrast, during the aerial phase, the ratio of mean aerodynamic force to body weight did not differ between blood-fed and unfed animals ( Fig. 3 J, Table S2 ). Thus, malaria mosquitoes enhanced aerodynamic forces proportionally to their weight increase from blood feeding, suggesting that aerodynamic force production was not limited within the range of tested blood loads. During the push-off phase, body pitch angles of blood-fed mosquitoes carrying this extra abdominal load were higher than those of unfed individuals ( Fig. 3 E, Table S2 ). Aerodynamic force control for carrying blood loads Our analysis of wingbeat kinematics during the aerial phase ( Fig. 4 ) shows that, similar to Culex mosquitoes ( Bomphrey et al., 2017 ), steadily flying unfed malaria mosquitoes operate at exceptionally low wingbeat amplitudes ( A stroke =42 deg) and high wingbeat frequencies ( f =579\u2005Hz; Fig. 4 I,L, Table S3 ). To carry a blood load, blood-fed mosquitoes adjust their wing movement pattern ( Fig. 4 A\u2013C) by increasing their stroke amplitude, rotation amplitude and stroke-plane pitch adjustment angle ( Fig. 4 I\u2013K, respectively). But strikingly, wingbeat frequency did not change significantly with force production ( Fig. 4 L, Table S3 ). In total, we tracked 1620 wingbeats during the areal phase of the 63 take-off maneuvers, based on which we tested how changes in wingbeat kinematics affect aerodynamic force production ( Fig. 4 A\u2013C; see database S2 in Muijres et al., 2017 ). The pooled dataset of 1620 wingbeats consisted of 264 wingbeats of steady flying unfed mosquitoes, 840 wingbeats of maneuvering unfed mosquitoes and 516 wingbeats of blood-fed mosquitoes. By fitting Fourier series onto the 264 wingbeats of steadily flying unfed mosquitoes (Eqn 7), we determined the mean wingbeat kinematics of steady-flying unfed malaria mosquitoes ( Fig. 4 A\u2013C; see database S2 in Muijres et al., 2017 ). The corresponding average wingbeat frequency of the steadily flying unfed mosquitoes was f steady =577\u00b141\u2005Hz ( n =264). Based on the body kinematics, we estimated the concomitant aerodynamic force production at F / mg unfed,steady =1.05\u00b10.11, a flight speed of U steady =0.23\u00b110\u2005m\u2005s \u22121 and a body pitch angle of \u03b2 steady =48\u00b19 deg. By applying our statistical model for aerodynamic force control (Eqn 8) to the 516 wingbeats of the blood-fed mosquitoes, we expressed how mosquitoes adjust their wingbeat kinematics for load-carrying, which resulted in a set of three Fourier series (for stroke angle, pitch angle and wing rotation angle, see database S2 in Muijres et al., 2017 ). The associated wingbeat-average force production for the 516 wingbeats of the blood-fed mosquitoes was estimated at F / mg unfed =2.21 (Eqns 4 and 5). We reconstructed the wingbeat kinematics for a mosquito that would produce this normalized force (Eqn 9 with F / mg unfed =2.21) and compared this with the 516 original wingbeats ( Fig. 4 A\u2013C). The reconstructed kinematics for the average blood-fed mosquito (dark red traces in Fig. 4 A\u2013C) overlay well onto the traces of all tracked wingbeats (red heat map in Fig. 4 A\u2013C), suggesting that the linear statistical model for force enhancement accurately captures the dynamics found in real blood-fed mosquitoes. To study how aerodynamic forces differed between steady flight of unfed mosquitoes and flight of the average blood-fed mosquito, we replayed the wingbeat kinematics for both cases (blue and red traces in Fig. 4 A\u2013C, respectively) in our aerodynamic model and determined the temporal dynamics of the aerodynamic forces (blue and red traces in Fig. 4 D\u2013H, respectively). We then compared the wingbeat-average aerodynamic force F aero with the force prediction from body acceleration and weight ( F total , Eqns 4\u20135) by calculating the ratio F aero / F total . For the unfed mosquito case, F aero / F total =0.97, while for the average blood-fed mosquito, F aero / F total =0.83. Thus, for the unfed mosquitoes, the quasi-steady model captures the required aerodynamic forces remarkably well, whereas for the average blood-fed mosquito, aerodynamic forces were underestimated by 17%. Our systematic study whereby we reconstructed kinematic patterns for the nine hypothetical mosquitoes with varying blood loads (Eqn 9) and then modeled their aerodynamic force production confirms this dynamics ( Fig. 4 M): for an unfed mosquito the quasi-steady model predicts aerodynamic forces rather well, but with increasing body weight the model increasingly underestimates total force production. The set of nine hypothetical mosquitoes was also used to test how adjustments of the different kinematics parameters with variations in blood load affect aerodynamic force production ( Fig. 4 M). The increased force production for carrying a blood load was almost fully explained by the variations in stroke angle kinematics, whereby an increase in stroke amplitude results in an enhancement of the aerodynamic force. The changes in deviation angle also slightly increased force production, but this was fully negated by concomitant changes in wing rotation angle. Leg-based and wing-derived forces throughout the push-off For a random subset of eight blood-fed and eight unfed mosquitoes, we tracked the transient wingbeat kinematics throughout the complete take-off, including the push-off phase and the aerial phase ( Fig. 5 A\u2013C,F\u2013H). We then calculated total external force production based on body accelerations (Eqns 4-5), and wing-derived aerodynamic forces using our aerodynamic model ( Fig. 5 D,I). To determine relative contributions of legs and wings to force production during the push-off phase, we compared instantaneous total external force (due to both legs and wings, F / mg total ) with the wingbeat-average aerodynamic forces ( F / mg aero , Fig. 5 E). During the aerial phase, total force and aerodynamic force were not significantly different ( Table S4 ), suggesting that it is valid to estimate leg forces during the push-off phase as the difference between total forces and the aerodynamic forces ( F / mg leg , Fig. 5 E). From these results, we then calculated the ratio between aerodynamic force and leg forces ( F aero / F leg , Fig. 5 J). These did not differ significantly between unfed and blood-fed mosquitoes ( Table S4 ), suggesting that blood-fed mosquitoes do not change their take-off behavior relative to unfed mosquitoes, and that they increased force production proportionally with their weight increase after blood-feeding. Combining F aero / F leg from blood-fed and unfed mosquitoes shows that during the push-off phase, mosquitoes produced aerodynamic forces that were, on average, \u223c50% higher than the leg-produced forces ( F aero / F leg =1.55\u00b11.29, n =16; Table S4 ). The effect of push-off force production on tactile detection by the host To avoid detection by a mammalian blood-host, an escaping blood-fed mosquito should reduce ground reaction forces to at least less than 0.07\u2005mN ( Li et al., 2011 ). Based on the momentum equation, the lift-off speed of a flying animal depends on the push-off force and push-off duration as follows: (10) Therefore, a reduction in force production directly leads to a decrease in take-off speed. Based on our take-off dynamics data, we tested how mosquitoes negate this apparent trade-off between stealth and speed during take-off. Take-off speed also depends on the duration of the push-off phase, \u0394 t push-off (see Eqn. 10), and thus, by extending the push-off phase, a mosquito can reduce push-off force without affecting take-off speed. Mosquitoes have relatively long legs (the average length of the front, middle and hind legs of our mosquitoes equaled 109%, 138% and 169% of their body length, respectively), which they almost fully extending throughout the push-off phase ( Fig. 2 , Movies 1\u20134 ). As a result, our mosquitoes traveled, on average, 88% of their body length away from the substratum while continuing to push off with their legs ( X lift-off / l body =0.88\u00b10.37, n =63). The resulting push-off duration was \u0394 t push-off =26.3\u00b111.5\u2005ms, and their lift-off speed was U lift-off =0.23\u00b10.05\u2005m\u2005s \u22121 . Exchanging leg-derived push-off forces for wing-derived aerodynamic forces might further reduce peak force production on the host's skin. Wing-derived aerodynamic forces produced by a flying animal generate forces on the substrate in the form of pressure waves ( Anderson, 1991 ; Lentink et al., 2015 ). According to actuator disk theory, these forces are distributed across a circular area with a radius comparable to the animal's wing span, or a sub-section of this disk for low-amplitude flapping wings ( Ellington, 1984 ). In both cases, the aerodynamic pressure waves will be distributed across several mechanosensors. In contrast, point-load forces produced by a mosquito leg can potentially trigger a single hair sensor, and thus leg forces have a much higher likelihood to be detected. We estimated peak forces during the push-off phase in our blood-fed mosquitoes by: (11) With F / mg push-off,max =2.01 and R m =1.93 for the average blood-fed mosquito, this results in a peak push-off force of F push-off,max =0.05 mN. The leg-based force component of this peak force is estimated by: (12) where the ratio of leg and total forces is F leg / F total =0.39, as determined in the analysis of the force dynamics during the push-off phase ( Fig. 5 ). This leads to a peak leg push-off force for the average blood-fed mosquito of F leg,max =0.02\u2005mN. Both the total peak push-off force and the leg-based peak force are below the 0.07\u2005mN threshold for mechanosensory hairs of mammals ( Li et al., 2011 ), suggesting that mammals cannot detect push-off forces of blood-fed malaria mosquitoes. Leg and wing muscle morphology of malaria mosquitoes Push-off forces and aerodynamic forces required for take-off are generated by the leg muscles and the indirect flight power muscles, respectively. Based on the \u00b5CT scans, we reconstructed the most important muscles of these systems ( Figs 1 D, 6 , Movie 8; see database S3 in Muijres et al., 2017 ). We identified flight power muscles (DVMs and DLMs, respectively), and the leg muscles that mostly power push-off: EDT1, EDT2 and EDT. The EDT2 muscle is homologous to the TDT found in several fly species, and these flies use to power escape take-offs ( Card and Dickinson, 2008a , b ). In flies, this TDT muscle is similar in size and orientation to the DVMs. But, as in tsetse flies ( King, 1983 ), the EDT2 muscle in the female malaria mosquito is much smaller than the DVMs, and is not attached to the tergal side of the thorax ( Fig. 6 , Movie 8 ). Thus, as in tsetse flies, mosquitoes lack a TDT muscle specialized for performing take-off escape maneuvers. DISCUSSION Kinematics and aerodynamics of blood-load carrying in malaria mosquitoes Our blood-fed mosquitoes were carrying a blood load roughly equal to their body weight, and were still capable of performing rapid take-off maneuvers ( Fig. 3 , Movies 3 , 4 ). The adjustments to wing and leg kinematics that enable mosquitoes to carry this extra weight are surprisingly simple ( Fig. 4 ). To boost aerodynamic force production for carrying a blood meal, mosquitoes relied almost completely on an increase in wing stroke amplitude ( Fig. 4 A,I,M), whereas wingbeat frequency was not altered ( Fig. 4 L). Mosquitoes also adjusted both the wing deviation angle and rotation angle ( Fig. 4 B,C,J,K), but these changes had only small effects on force production ( Fig. 4 M). Instead, changes in deviation and rotation angles were associated with changes in body pitch: mosquitoes with abdominal blood loads were oriented more vertically than unfed animals ( Fig. 3 E), and thus a concomitant nose-down rotation of the stroke plane was required to continue alignment of the aerodynamic lift vector with the vertical body weight vector ( Fig. 4 K). For a series of hypothetical mosquitoes with a range of blood loads, we compared wingbeat-averaged aerodynamic forces with their body weight, showing that aerodynamic forces were similar to the forces required for weight support ( Fig. 4 M). However, with increasing blood loads, the difference between required force and the aerodynamically modeled force increasingly differed ( Fig. 4 M). This is most likely because of the limitations of our quasi-steady aerodynamic model which did not include several unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms, such as wake capture and added mass ( Dickinson and Muijres, 2016 ). These unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms might thus become increasingly more important with greater force production; in particular, trailing-edge vortex lift, which was recently described in flying mosquitoes, might play an important role here ( Bomphrey et al., 2017 ). Future research into the detailed aerodynamics of mosquito flight is required to answer this question. The hovering kinematics of our malaria mosquitoes are similar to those of Culex mosquitoes ( Bomphrey et al., 2017 ), but differ substantially from those of most other insect flyers that operate at much higher stroke amplitudes and correspondingly lower wingbeat frequencies ( Alexander, 2004 ; Dudley, 2002 ). For example, a fruit fly of comparable mass beats its wings at an amplitude of 160 deg and frequency of 190\u2005Hz ( Muijres et al., 2014 ), which are four times and one-third the values for mosquitoes, respectively. The simple stroke-amplitude-based method that our mosquitoes use to increase force production when carrying a load is also very different from that of other flying insects and vertebrates, which exhibit more complex kinematic adjustments to increase force production, including changes in stroke amplitude, wingbeat frequency and angle of attack ( Alexander, 2004 ; Dudley, 2002 ; Muijres et al., 2014 ). By contrast, honeybees, which carry large nectar and pollen loads, use kinematic patterns similar to those of mosquitoes, with high operating frequencies and low amplitudes, and also alter only stroke amplitude to adjust aerodynamic force production ( Altshuler et al., 2005 ). Honeybee flight is aerodynamically less efficient (higher aerodynamic power costs) than that of fruit flies ( Altshuler et al., 2005 ), and thus the low-amplitude wingbeats of mosquitoes might similarly be energetically suboptimal in normal hovering. Instead, the low-amplitude flight style used by mosquitoes and honeybees enables sustained flight with substantial loads by only increasing stroke amplitude, thereby allowing the insects to continue operating at the natural frequency of the oscillatory neuro-mechanical system ( Pringle, 1957 ). In contrast, flyers that use high-amplitude wingbeats have no such capacity because stroke amplitude is anatomically limited to 180 deg, at which point the left and right wings collide at the end of each stroke ( Lehmann and Dickinson, 1997 ). Take-off speed and stealth in escaping malaria mosquitoes We studied the voluntary and escape take-offs by blood-fed and unfed mosquitoes ( Fig. 3 ). Compared with unfed individuals, blood-fed mosquitoes on average had take-off speeds that were 18% lower, and ascent angles that were 28% lower than those of unfed mosquitoes ( Fig. 3 G,H, Table S2 ). A reduction in the escape speed of mosquitoes when carrying a blood load increases the risk of being captured by jumping spiders ( Roitberg et al., 2003 ), and likewise might make mosquitoes more vulnerable to being killed by a host. If slow take-offs increase the risk of being killed by a host, mosquitoes should perform faster take-offs when escaping from a vibratory stimulus than when performing a voluntary take-off, as is the case in fruit flies responding to looming stimuli ( Card and Dickinson, 2008a ). But surprisingly, we found no significant differences between voluntary and escape take-offs ( Table S1 ). Our vibratory stimulus may have been insufficient to trigger escape dynamics, but the mosquitoes did respond robustly to the stimulus. In addition, the apparent inability of mosquitoes to perform the specialized escape take-offs that have been described in fruit flies ( Card and Dickinson, 2008b ) is also supported anatomically by leg muscle reconstructions ( Figs 1 D, 5 ). The extracoxal depressor of the trochanter of the middle mosquito leg is much smaller than that of the fruit fly and does not attach to the tergal/dorsal side of the thorax. Thus, as in tsetse flies, mosquitoes lack a TDT muscle specialized for performing rapid and forceful leg extensions required for powerful leg push-offs ( King, 1983 ). The fact that mosquitoes never evolved a specialized TDT muscle might be because mechanical constraints of long slender legs prevent mosquitoes from performing high-speed take-offs, or that the selection pressure for a fast escape take-off was not sufficiently strong. However, the chance of survival in mosquitoes escaping from jumping spiders correlates positively with take-off speed ( Roitberg et al., 2003 ), suggesting that successful evasion from predators, and possibly irritated hosts, requires fast take-offs. We therefore interpret the absence of more robust legs with specialized TDT muscles in mosquitoes, and the consequent inability to perform rapid take-offs, as the result of a trade-off between escape speed and stealth. When taking off from a host, blood-feeding insects need to simultaneously maximize escape speed and minimize pressure forces excreted on the host, which are conflicting requirements. To test this notion, we compared the take-off dynamics between malaria mosquitoes that must escape from a host with those of similarly sized fruit flies ( Card and Dickinson, 2008a ). Lift-off speeds in our mosquitoes are strikingly similar to those of fruit flies performing a voluntary take-off (mosquitoes: U lift-off =0.23\u00b10.05\u2005m\u2005s \u22121 , n =63; fruit flies: U lift-off =0.24 m s \u22121 ; Card and Dickinson, 2008a ). In contrast, the weight-normalized peak push-off forces produced by mosquitoes were only 27% of those of fruit flies (mosquitoes: F / mg max =2.23\u00b10.47, n =63; fruit flies: F / mg max =8.27). Thus, mosquitoes are capable of reaching take-off speeds comparable to those of fruit flies, but with much lower push-off forces, which might possibly reduce the chance of being detected by the host. Mosquitoes achieve this by fully extending their relatively long legs throughout the push-off phase, allowing them to travel on average 88% of their body length away from the substratum while continuing to push off with their legs ( X lift-off / l body =0.88\u00b10.37, n =63; Fig. 2 , Movies 1\u20134 ); fruit flies, with their much shorter legs, travel only 25% of their body length during push-off ( Card and Dickinson, 2008a ). This process also extends the leg push-off duration in mosquitoes to 4.8 times the push-off duration of fruit flies (mosquitoes: \u0394 t push-off =26.3\u00b111.5\u2005ms, n =63; fruit flies: \u0394 t push-off =5.5\u2005ms). Because lift-off speed depends directly on the change in momentum during the push-off phase (Eqn 10), a longer push-off duration allows the mosquito to reach lift-off speeds similar to those of fruit flies, despite much lower peak forces imposed on the substratum. Because the vertebrate integument is highly sensitive to imposed pressures ( Li et al., 2011 ), leg push-off forces with their imposed point loads can be more easily detected than the much more broadly distributed pressure waves produced by flapping wings ( Anderson, 1991 ; Lentink et al., 2015 ). Mosquitoes thus further reduce the chance of being detected by having wings produce 61% of the force during push-off ( Fig. 4 , Table S4 ), rather than relying solely on forces generated by the legs pushing on the host, as is the case for escaping fruit flies ( Card and Dickinson, 2008b ). As a result, blood-fed mosquitoes produce peak leg forces ( F leg,max \u223c0.02\u2005mN) that were below the detection threshold of mechanosensory hairs of mammals (0.07\u2005mN; Li et al., 2011 ), whereas peak leg force of escaping fruit flies ( F leg,max \u223c0.15\u2005mN) were above this threshold. Thus, mosquitoes that escape from a host after blood feeding can achieve relatively high take-off speeds while generating peak forces imposed on the host that are below the detection threshold, despite the fact that they need to carry a blood meal that can double to triple the animals' total weight. Mosquitoes achieve this using wing-generated aerodynamic forces during push-off rather than relying just on forces produced by the legs, and by carrying out a precisely controlled extension of their relatively long legs. Reduction in tactile detection by the host following a blood meal, and possibly during landings, may be a general locomotor feature of blood-feeding insects.

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of different temperatures (15, 25 and 30\u00b0C) on the cardiorespiratory rates and cardiac autonomic tonus of premetamorphic tadpoles of the bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus . To this end, a non-invasive method was developed to permit measurements of electrocardiogram (ECG) and buccal movements ( f B ; surface electromyography of the buccal floor). For evaluation of autonomic regulation, intraperitoneal injections of Ringer solution (control), atropine (cholinergic muscarinic antagonist) and sotalol (\u03b2-adrenergic antagonist) were performed. Ringer solution injections did not affect heart rate ( f H ) or f B across temperatures. Cardiorespiratory parameters were significantly augmented by temperature ( f H : 24.5\u00b11.0, 54.5\u00b12.0 and 75.8\u00b12.8 beats min \u22121 at 15, 25 and 30\u00b0C, respectively; f B : 30.3\u00b11.1, 73.1\u00b14.0 and 100.6\u00b13.7 movements min \u22121 at 15, 25 and 30\u00b0C, respectively). A predominant vagal tone was observed at 15\u00b0C (32.0\u00b13.2%) and 25\u00b0C (27.2\u00b16.7%) relative to the adrenergic tone. At 30\u00b0C, the adrenergic tone increased relative to the lower temperature. In conclusion, the cholinergic and adrenergic tones seem to be independent of temperature for colder thermal intervals (15\u201325\u00b0C), while exposure to a hotter ambient temperature (30\u00b0C) seems to be followed by a significant increase in adrenergic tone and may reflect cardiovascular adjustments made to match oxygen delivery to demand. Furthermore, while excluding the use of implantable electrodes or cannulae, this study provides a suitable non-invasive method for investigating cardiorespiratory function (cardiac and respiratory rates) in water-breathing animals such as the tadpole.

In each abdominal segment, the medial giant axons make synaptic connections with paired myelinated motor giant axons that excite the abdominal deep flexor muscles and drive the tailflips that constitute the escape behavior. I examined (1) anatomical features of the abdominal motor giant fibers and (2) electrical properties of both the medial and motor giant axons in the pink shrimp, Farfantepenaeus duorarum . The motor giant axons in the paired third roots of shrimp abdominal ganglia emerge from a single fused neurite that originates from two clusters of cell bodies within the ganglion. Injection of large positive currents into the abdominal medial giant fibers generates action potentials that are transmitted to the opposite medial giant axon through putative collateral synapses within the ganglia. Transmission across the medial-to-motor giant synapse is fast and resistant to fatigue, with synaptic delays equal to or less than those previously documented at the lateral-to-motor giant electrical synapse in crayfish. Transmission was found to be extremely reliable even with presynaptic spike frequencies as high as 250\u2005Hz. While action potentials within the medial giant fibers are transmitted across the medial-to-motor giant synapse with a large safety factor, neither prolonged positive nor prolonged negative currents pass through the synaptic nexus, irrespective of the site of injection. The lack of DC current passage along with the inability of neurobiotin or biocytin to spread through the synaptic nexus raises the possibility that the synaptic mechanism may be capacitative.

Nyboer PDF ABSTRACT Increasing water temperatures owing to anthropogenic climate change are predicted to negatively impact the aerobic metabolic performance of aquatic ectotherms. Specifically, it has been hypothesized that thermal increases result in reductions in aerobic scope (AS), which lead to decreases in energy available for essential fitness and performance functions. Consequences of warming are anticipated to be especially severe for warm-adapted tropical species as they are thought to have narrow thermal windows and limited plasticity for coping with elevated temperatures. In this study we test how predicted warming may affect the aerobic performance of Nile perch ( Lates niloticus ), a commercially harvested fish species in the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa. We measured critical thermal maxima (CT max ) and key metabolic variables such as AS and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) across a range of temperatures, and compared responses between acute (3-day) exposures and 3-week acclimations. CT max increased with acclimation temperature; however, 3-week-acclimated fish had higher overall CT max than acutely exposed individuals. Nile perch also showed the capacity to increase or maintain high AS even at temperatures well beyond their current range; however, acclimated Nile perch had lower AS compared with acutely exposed fish. These changes were accompanied by lower EPOC, suggesting that drops in AS may reflect improved energy utilization after acclimation, a finding that is supported by improvements in growth at high temperatures over the acclimation period. Overall, the results challenge predictions that tropical species have limited thermal plasticity, and that high temperatures will be detrimental because of limitations in AS.

Kapheim PDF ABSTRACT Eusocial insect colonies are defined by extreme variation in reproductive activity among castes, but the ancestral conditions from which this variation arose are unknown. Investigating the factors that contribute to variation in reproductive physiology among solitary insects that are closely related to social species can help to fill this gap. We experimentally tested the role of nutrition, juvenile hormone (JH) and social cues on reproductive maturation in solitary alkali bees (Halictidae: Nomia melanderi ). We found that alkali bee females emerge from overwintering with small Dufour's glands and small ovaries, containing oocytes in the early stages of development. Oocyte maturation occurs rapidly, and is staggered between the two ovaries. Lab-reared females reached reproductive maturity without access to mates or nesting opportunities, and many had resorbed oocytes. Initial activation of these reproductive structures does not depend on pollen consumption, though dietary protein or lipids may be necessary for long-term reproductive activity. JH is likely to be a limiting factor in alkali bee reproductive activation, as females treated with JH were more likely to develop mature oocytes and Dufour's glands. Unlike for related social bees, the effects of JH were not suppressed by the presence of older, reproductive females. These results provide valuable insight into the factors that influence reproductive activity in an important native pollinator, and those that may have been particularly influential in the evolution of reproductive castes.

Here, we outfitted 18 deep-diving long-finned pilot whales with multi-sensor data loggers and found indications that their diving strategy is associated with higher costs than those of other deep-diving toothed whales . Theoretical models predict that optimal speed is proportional to (basal metabolic rate/drag) 1/3 and therefore to body mass 0.05 . The transit speed of tagged animals (2.7\u00b10.3\u2005m\u2005s \u22121 ) was substantially higher than the optimal speed predicted from body mass (1.4\u20131.7\u2005m\u2005s \u22121 ). According to the theoretical models, this choice of high transit speed, given a similar drag coefficient (median, 0.0035) to that in other cetaceans, indicated greater basal metabolic costs during diving than for other cetaceans. This could explain the comparatively short duration (8.9\u00b11.5\u2005min) of their deep dives (maximum depth, 444\u00b185\u2005m). Hydrodynamic gliding models indicated negative buoyancy of tissue body density (1038.8\u00b11.6\u2005kg\u2005m \u20133 , \u00b195% credible interval, CI) and similar diving gas volume (34.6\u00b10.6\u2005ml\u2005kg \u22121 , \u00b195% CI) to those in other deep-diving toothed whales. High diving metabolic rate and costly negative buoyancy imply a \u2018spend more, gain more\u2019 strategy of long-finned pilot whales, differing from that in other deep-diving toothed whales, which limits the costs of locomotion during foraging. We also found that net buoyancy affected the optimal speed: high transit speeds gradually decreased during ascent as the whales approached neutral buoyancy owing to gas expansion.

Which strategy is the most energy efficient? In Pteromalus puparum , 92% of take-offs by were propelled entirely by movements of the middle and hind legs, which were depressed at their coxo-trochanteral and extended at their femoro-tibial joints. The front legs left the ground first, followed by the hind legs, so that the middle legs provided the final propulsion. Second, in other species of a similar mass, Cotesia glomerata and Leptopilina boulardi , all take-offs were propelled by a mean of 2.8 and 3.8 wingbeats, respectively, with little or no contribution from the legs. The first strategy resulted in take-off times that were four times shorter (5 versus 22.8\u2005ms) and take-off velocities that were four times faster (0.8 versus 0.2\u2005m\u2005s \u22121 ). Calculations from the kinematics indicate that propulsion by the legs was the most energy-efficient strategy, because more energy is put into propulsion of the body, whereas in take-off propelled by repetitive wing movements energy is lost to generating these movements and moving the air. In heavier species such as Netelia testacea and Amblyteles armatorius , take-off was propelled by the combined movements of the middle and hind legs and wingbeats. In A. armatorius , this resulted in the longest mean take-off time of 33.8\u2005ms but an intermediate take-off velocity of 0.4\u2005m\u2005s \u22121 . In all three strategies the performance could be explained without invoking energy storage and power amplification mechanisms. FOOTNOTES The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

Melatonin is in the extraembryonic yolk sac of the avian egg; melatonin binds calmodulin. The aim of this study was to investigate the function of melatonin in the formation of the chick embryo optic cups and S-shaped heart, by pharmacological methods and immunoassays. Mel1a melatonin receptor immunofluorescence was distributed in the optic cups and rudimentary hearts. We separated embryonated chicken eggs at 48\u2005h of incubation into basal, control and drug-treated groups, with treatment applied in the egg air sac. At 66 h of incubation, embryos were excised from the eggs and analyzed. Embryos from the basal, control (distilled water), melatonin and 6-chloromelatonin (melatonin receptor agonist) groups had regular optic cups and an S-shaped heart, while those from the calmidazolium (calmodulin inhibitor) group did not. Embryos from the luzindole (melatonin receptor antagonist) and prazosin (Mel1c melatonin receptor antagonist) groups did not have regular optic cups. Embryos from the 4-P-PDOT (Mel1b melatonin receptor antagonist) group did not have an S-shaped heart. Previous application of the melatonin, 6-chloromelatonin or forskolin (adenylate cyclase enhancer) prevented the abnormal appearance of chick embryos from the calmidazolium, luzindole, prazosin and 4-P-PDOT groups. However, 6-chloromelatonin and forskolin only partially prevented the development of defective eye cups in embryos from the calmidazolium group. The results suggested that melatonin modulates chick embryo morphogenesis via calmodulin and membrane receptors. FOOTNOTES The authors declare no competing or financial interests.

Sensory input in situ is a mosaic of both enrichment and stress, yet little is known about how multiple environmental factors interact to affect brain anatomical structures, circuits, and cognitive function. In this study, we address these issues by testing the individual and combined effects of sub-adulthood thermal stress, larval density, and early-adulthood living spatial enrichment on brain anatomy and olfactory associative learning in adult Drosophila melanogaster . In response to heat stress, the mushroom bodies (MBs) were the most volumetrically impaired among all of the brain structures, an effect highly correlated with reduced odor learning performance. However, MBs were not sensitive to either larval culture densities or early-adulthood living conditions. Extreme larval crowding reduced the volume of antennal lobes, optic lobes, and central complex. Neither larval crowding nor early-adulthood spatial enrichment affected olfactory learning. These results illustrate that various brain structures react differently to environmental inputs, and that MB development and learning are highly sensitive to certain stressors (pre-adult hyperthermia) and resistant to others (larval crowding).

Here we address this issue by studying the neuromuscular origins of display behavior in a small tropical passerine bird called the golden-collared manakin ( Manacus vitellinus ). Males of this species court females by dancing around the forest floor and rapidly snapping their wings together above their back. Using radio-telemetry, we collected electromyographic (EMG) recordings from the three main muscles that control avian forelimb movement, and found how these different muscles are activated to generate various aspects of display behavior. The muscle that raises the wing ( supracoracoideus , SC) and the primary muscle that retracts the wing ( scapulohumeralis caudalis , SH) were activated during the wing-snap, whereas the pectoralis (PEC), the main wing depressor, was not. SC activation began before wing elevation commenced, with further activation occurring gradually. By contrast, SH activation was swift, starting soon after wing elevation and peaking shortly after the snap. The intensity of this SH activation was comparable to that which occurs during flapping, whereas the SC activation was much lower. Thus, light activation of the SC likely helps position the wings above the back, so that quick, robust SH activation can drive these appendages together to generate the firecracker-like snap sonation. This is one of the first looks at the neuromuscular mechanisms that underlie the actuation of a dynamic courtship display, and it demonstrates that even complex, whole-body display movements can be studied with transmitter-aided EMG techniques.

Rosen PDF Abstract Seemingly chaotic waves of spontaneous chromatophore activity occur in the ommastrephid squid, Dosidicus gigas , in the living state and immediately after surgical disruption of all known inputs from the central nervous system. Similar activity is apparent in the loliginid, Doryteuthis opalescens , but only after chronic denervation of chromatophores for 5-7 days. Electrically-stimulated, neurally-driven activity in intact individuals of both species is blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX), but TTX has no effect on spontaneous wave-activity in either Dosidicus or denervated D. opalescens . Spontaneous, TTX-resistant activity of this sort is therefore likely myogenic, and such activity is eliminated in both preparations by 5-HT, a known inhibitor of chromatophore activity. Immunohistochemical techniques reveal that individual axons containing L-glutamate (L-Glu) or 5-HT (and possibly both in a minority of processes) are associated with radial muscle fibers of chromatophores in intact individuals of both species, although the area of contact between both types of axons and muscle fibers is much smaller in Dosidicus . Glutamatergic and serotonergic axons degenerate completely following denervation in D. opalescens . Spontaneous waves of chromatophore activity in both species are thus associated with reduced (or no) serotonergic input in comparison to the situation in intact D. opalescens . Such differences in the level of serotonergic inhibition are consistent with natural chromogenic behaviours in these species. Our findings also suggest that such activity might propagate via the branching distal ends of radial muscle fibers.

Being expressed in the mesenchyme of trachea, lung and diaphragm, and in phrenic motoneurons HOXA5 is a key transcription factor regulating lung development and function. Consequently, most Hoxa5 \u2212/\u2212 mutants die at birth from respiratory failure. However, the extensive effect of the null mutation makes it difficult to identify the origins of respiratory dysfunction in newborns. To address the physiological impact of Hoxa5 tissue-specific roles, we used conditional gene targeting with the Dermo1 Cre and Olig2 Cre mouse lines to produce specific Hoxa5 deletions in mesenchyme and motoneurons, respectively. Hoxa5 expression in mesenchyme is critical for trachea development, whereas its expression in phrenic motoneurons is essential for diaphragm formation. Breathing measurements in adult mice with whole body plethysmography demonstrated that at rest, only the motoneuron deletion affects respiration due to higher breathing frequency and decreased tidal volume. But subsequent exposure to a moderate hypoxic challenge (F i O 2 =0.12; 10 min) revealed that both mutant mice hyperventilate more than controls. Hoxa5 flox/flox ; Dermo1 +/cre mice showed augmented tidal volume while Hoxa5 flox/flox ; Olig2 +/cre mice had the largest increase in breathing frequency. No significant differences were observed between medulla-spinal cord preparations from E18.5 control and Hoxa5 flox/flox ; Olig2 +/Cre mouse embryos that could support a role for Hoxa5 in fetal inspiratory motor command. According to our data, Hoxa5 expression in mesenchyme and phrenic motor neurons controls distinct aspects of respiratory development.

Field PDF Abstract Social animals must constantly assess their environment to make appropriate behavioral decisions. The use of various sensory modalities is imperative in this process and it is hypothesized that the highly conserved brain nuclei comprising the social decision making network (SDMN) integrates social information with an animal's internal state to elicit behavioral responses. Here, we used the highly social African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni , to investigate whether reproductively-receptive (gravid) females show contextual chemosensory signaling, social behaviors, and neural activation patterns within the SDMN. We exposed gravid females to different social contexts: 1) dominant male (inter-sexual reproductive); 2) mouth brooding (non-receptive) female, and 3) gravid female (intra-sexual aggressive); 4) juvenile fish (low social salience); and 5) empty compartment (control). By injecting females with a blue dye to visualize urine pulses, we found that gravid females show context-dependent urination, exhibiting higher urination rates in the presence of dominant males (reproductive context) and mouth brooding females (aggressive contexts). Further, gravid females show contextual aggression with increased aggressive displays toward mouth brooding females compared to other gravid females. Using in situ hybridization to quantify cells expressing the immediate early gene cfos as a measure of neural activation, we also show that certain regions of the SDMN in gravid females are differentially activated after exposure to high compared to low social salience contexts. Coupled with previous reports, these results demonstrate true chemosensory communication in both sexes of a single fish species, as well as reveal the neural substrates mediating intra- and inter-sexual social behaviors in females.

Although they are marine mammals, sea otters returned to the sea relatively recently and feed at the surface. Therefore, they represent a transitional stage of aquatic adaptation. Currently no feeding performance studies of sea otters have been conducted. The main objective of this study was to characterize the feeding kinematic profile in sea otters. It was hypothesized that sea otters would exhibit a terrestrial feeding behavior and that they forcefully crush hard prey at large gapes. As a result, biting kinematics would be congruent with biting behavior reported for their terrestrial ancestors, thus providing additional evidence that raptorial biting is a conserved behavior even in recently aquatic mammals. Sea otters consistently used a durophagous raptorial biting mode characterized by large gapes, large gape angles, and lack of lateral gape occlusion. The shorter skulls and mandibles of sea otters, along with increased mechanical advantages of the masseter and increased bite force, form a repertoire of functional traits for durophagy. Here we consider durophagy to be a specialized raptorial biting feeding mode. A comparison of feeding kinematics of wild vs captive sea otters showed no significant differences in lateral kinematic profiles and only minor differences in three frontal kinematic profiles, which included a slower maximum opening gape velocity, a slower maximum gape opening velocity, and a slower maximum closing gape velocity in captive sea otters. Data indicate functional innovations for producing large bite forces at wide gape and gape angles.

It has long been suggested that these traits co-vary, although their relationships are debated. In the present study, we investigated whether metabolism, behaviour, growth and the potential relationships among them vary with food availability in sterile triploid carp. In this experimental animal model, we investigated the standard metabolic rate (SMR), growth performance and personality traits (i.e., activity, exploration and boldness) of juvenile individuals before and after 25 days of rearing in which fish were fed either once or twice a day to satiation. Inter-individual differences in SMR in each group showed high repeatability across the experimental period, and twice-fed fish showed higher SMRs than did once-fed fish after 25 days of rearing. Compared with the once-fed group, the twice-fed group showed higher feeding rates (FRs) and lower feeding efficiencies (FEs) but similar specific growth rates (SGRs). None of the personality traits were affected by food availability. Furthermore, both boldness and exploration were highly repeatable throughout the experiment in the group fed twice a day, whereas only exploration showed repeatability in the group fed once a day. In the once-fed group, SMR and the personality traits were positively correlated with FR and negatively correlated with FE and (or) SGR; however, these relationships did not exist in the twice-fed group due to the surplus of food. These results suggest that food availability significantly affects physiological, behavioural and ecological processes in these fish by altering the trade-off between metabolism and growth.

The mRNA expression levels of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and Na + /K + /2Cl \u2212 cotransporter 1a (NKCC1a) in the gills rapidly decreased after transfer to FW, whereas Na + /H + exchanger 3 (NHE3) and Na + /Cl \u2212 cotransporter 2 (NCC2) expressions were upregulated following the transfer. By quadruple-color whole-mount immunofluorescence staining with anti-Na + /K + -ATPase, anti-NHE3, anti-CFTR and T4 (anti-NKCC1a/NCC2) antibodies, we classified ionocytes into one SW-type and two FW-types; NHE3 cell and NCC2 cell. Time-course observation after transfer revealed an intermediate type between SW-type and FW-type NHE3 ionocytes, suggesting functional plasticity of ionocytes. Finally, on the basis of the ionocyte classification of Japanese seabass, we observed the location of ionocyte subtypes on frozen sections of the gill filaments stained by triple-color immunofluorescence staining. Our observation indicated that SW-type ionocytes transformed into FW-type NHE3 ionocytes and at the same time shifted their distribution from filaments to lamellae. On the other hand, FW-specific NCC2 ionocytes appeared mainly in the filaments. Taken together, these findings indicated that ionocytes originated from undifferentiated cells in the filaments and expanded their distribution to the lamellae during FW acclimation.

A segment (\u223c1.5 mm long) of a skinned muscle fibre isolated from rabbit psoas muscle was held isometric (sarcomere length \u223c2.5\u00b5m) at 8-9 \u00b0C, maximally Ca-activated and a ramp shortening applied. The tension decline with a ramp shortening showed an early decrease of slope (the P 1 transition) followed by a slower decrease in slope (the P 2 transition) to the steady (isotonic) force. The tension level at the initial P 1 transition and the time t 1 to that transition decreased as the velocity is increased; the length change L 1 to this transition increased with shortening velocity to a steady value of \u223c8 nm / half-sarcomere. A small rapid temperature jump (3-4 \u00b0C, <0.2 ms, T-jump) applied coincident with the onset of ramp shortening showed force enhancement by T-jump and changed the tension decline markedly. Analyses showed that the rate of T-jump induced force rise increased linearly with increase of shortening velocity. The results provide crucial evidence that the strain-sensitive crossbridge force generation, or a step closely coupled to it, is endothermic.

We investigated anterior vena caval P O2 and S O2 during dives of an adult female sea lion to investigate two hypotheses: a) posterior vena caval S O2 is not representative of the entire venous oxygen store and b) a well-oxygenated (arterialized) central venous oxygen reservoir might account for maintenance of arterial S O2 during lung collapse. During deep dives, initial anterior vena caval S O2 was elevated at 83.6 + 8.4 % (n=102), presumably due to arteriovenous shunting. It remained high until the bottom phase of the dive and then decreased during ascent, whereas previously determined posterior vena caval S O2 declined during descent and then often increased during ascent. These divergent patterns confirmed that posterior vena caval S O2 was not representative of the entire venous oxygen store. Prior to, and early during descent of deep-dives, the high S O2 s of both the anterior and posterior venae cavae may enhance arterialization of a central venous oxygen store. However, anterior vena caval S O2 values at depths beyond lung collapse reached levels as low as 40%, making it unlikely that even a completely arterialized central venous oxygen store could account for maintenance of high arterial S O2 . These findings suggest that maintenance of high arterial S O2 during deep dives is due to persistence of some gas exchange at depths beyond presumed lung collapse.

In 1995, she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine, along with Eric Wieschaus and Edward Lewis, for her work on the genetic control of embryogenesis using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster . In the 1990s, she transitioned her lab to working with zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), using similar forward genetic approaches to those that had proved so successful in Drosophila to uncover key regulators of vertebrate development. We met with Christiane at the recent International Society for Developmental Biology (ISDB) meeting in Singapore, to talk about her research, the impact of the Nobel Prize and the challenges of being a \u2018woman in science\u2019. Let's start at the beginning: what got you interested in biology in the first place? I was interested in animals and plants from very early on. I can't remember having been taught it as a young child, but I was always curious, even before I went to school. I collected plants from the garden and so on, and I remember that a father of a school friend of mine collected butterflies \u2013 with which I was fascinated \u2013 and later I also joined a bird-watching club. I still love looking at nature like this \u2013 I have a big garden and I'm very interested in gardening and wild flowers. Once I got to secondary school, we had very good science teachers, and of course that helped as well. Your undergraduate and PhD degrees were in biochemistry and molecular biology, but you've said that you started to get bored with that field towards the end of your PhD thesis. What attracted you to developmental genetics and how did you transition into that field? I actually started my undergraduate studies with biology and I found the lectures rather boring, so I switched to physics, which at the time was fascinating and was taught by a very good professor. I also really enjoyed physical chemistry, and I moved into biochemistry \u2013 in which I eventually got my diploma \u2013 in order to get a solid background in basic science. My PhD was in molecular biology, but I'm not a molecular biologist or a biochemist. I went into this area because I was ambitious and at that time it was the field that was really moving forwards and was fashionable. But at the end I found I wanted to do more organismal biology. I think I went into developmental biology at least partly because Alfred Gierer's group in our institute was working with Hydra , trying to isolate the factors that would specify \u2018head\u2019 and so on. Being exposed to this work, I became interested in the question of morphogens. The Gierer-Meinhardt model on morphogen gradients had just been published, and though I didn't fully understand it, I could see that morphogens were becoming a big issue in the field. However, people were against gradients because they hadn't been identified. I thought that to identify morphogens you had to combine genetics and developmental biology: if you could make a mutation in a gene that encoded a gradient and see the consequences of its loss, you would be on the way to finding them. I wrote a proposal for an EMBO fellowship that spelt this idea out, and this was how I ended up in Walter Gehring's lab working with Drosophila . Gehring kept the strain of the only potential morphogen mutant (identified by Alice Bull in 1966) at the time, which had mirror image duplications of the posterior end that no one understood, although Meinhardt explained to me that it must be a gradient mutant. This was bicaudal , and I tried to understand it but it was the most difficult mutant I ever worked on. So instead I developed methods to make my own mutants and finally ended up at EMBL with Eric Wieschaus, where we started the large-scale screens. And this is probably the work you're best known for and that won you and Eric the Nobel Prize \u2013 the large-scale genetic screens in Drosophila embryos. Did you think in advance that this work would be so influential? Looking back, it is amazing how little was known about anything at the time. For example, no one knew anything about how segmentation could work, or about polarity \u2013 at least beyond the theoretical work. So it was a completely open area and whatever you touched would turn out to be interesting. For example, in the first half-year in Walter Gehring's lab I isolated the dorsal mutant, which is a gradient mutant. Lucky me \u2013 that was exactly what I'd been looking for! And then we started to find these segmentation mutants \u2013 they just popped up when you looked at large numbers of embryos. But strangely enough Eric and I seemed to be the only people who saw the potential in screening for mutants. Somehow, we were far ahead of everyone else \u2013 who all thought that screens were too much effort and that they might not work, or that you'd only find \u02bbmessy' things. As I've said before, there was also this idea that there were no gradients; many people at the time believed in specific localised determinants rather than gradients. Some groups that did do screens looking for particular kinds of mutants (maternal homeotic mutants) failed completely because they couldn't interpret the mutants they found \u2013 they didn't fit with their model for how development would work. So when we did our screen, we found things that people had isolated before but hadn't recognised for what they were. When we started, we had different research backgrounds and our own interests \u2013 I was pushing to do maternal screens to try and get at the morphogens, which was genetically very tricky, while Eric was particularly interested in oogenesis and sex determination. But we had a very small lab with just one technician between us and so we realised it would be better to do things together. So we decided to do the large-scale zygotic screens together, and we were amazingly successful. We were a good team: we had similar observational qualities and were both pushing hard. Three years of collaboration was enough \u2013 we were both strong characters \u2013 but it worked incredibly well for that time. One big question was: now we understand something about fly embryogenesis, what about vertebrates? Do they do things the same or completely differently? And what came out of the screen? Did you uncover genes that play key roles across evolution and did this in some way trigger your starting to work with zebrafish? Actually, the highlights in the fly screens aren't conserved at all. In the first evaluation we focussed on segmentation because this is easiest \u2013 you can cleanly count the segments and look at polarity and so on. This gave us the pair-rule genes and the gap genes, which were exciting because they told us a lot about an important developmental hierarchy, but these principles aren't conserved beyond insects. And then when I moved to T\u00fcbingen, we did the maternal screens to get the morphogens (which I wanted from the beginning) \u2013 we found genes such as bicoid and oskar , but again these are not conserved. So, one big question was: now we understand something about fly embryogenesis, what about vertebrates? Do they do things the same or completely differently? At the time, the people working with frogs (which were the main system for vertebrate developmental biology back then; the mouse was not that well developed) were a completely separate community from the fly people, and they thought that the fly couldn't tell them anything. The prevailing view was to explain everything with \u2018factors\u2019, and to approach developmental biology through embryological rather than genetic manipulation, while we explained everything with genes and genetics. And I was convinced that the genetic approach was the better one and that you needed to be able to do genetics in vertebrates. It was only around that time, beginning with the homeobox genes, that the homology between invertebrates and vertebrates slowly became apparent. But we had decided to start a screen in zebrafish before we fully appreciated the degree of conservation, and actually the screen turned up many of the same genes that had already been identified as key factors in frog, so we were perhaps a bit late with this. The biggest question in vertebrate development at the time was how gastrulation works and how the axes are organised, and Eddy De Robertis, Marc Kirschner, Jim Smith and others had already identified things like the critical BMP gradients, so when we identified and cloned the equivalent fish mutants they weren't a huge surprise. How difficult was it to transition your lab \u2013 which had had such success working with flies \u2013 to zebrafish? Well, by then the fly lab was not that big anymore. My lab style has always been that postdocs took their projects with them, and some of the graduate students too: Ruth Lehmann took oskar and a bunch of mutants with her, and Kathryn Anderson took most of the dorsal group genes. So people had gone away with some of the most interesting projects. When the screens were finished, we began to clone some mutants, which I found tedious and did not like too much, so I decided I wanted to move to fish. However, then the Bicoid gradient was discovered by Hans Georg Frohnh\u00f6fer and Wolfgang Driever and the Dorsal gradient by Siegfried Roth (all graduate students in the lab), and we were working very successfully with these projects and the transcription factor hierarchies, and doing lots of biochemistry, and this kept us busy for quite some time. Two graduate students, Stefan Schulte-Merker and Matthias Hammerschmidt, started working with fish on the side during this period, and when the fish screen really got started the fly lab was gradually coming to a natural end. Setting up a screen in a new organism is a lot of work, but I like this kind of work \u2013 developing devices and tools that make things easier and more efficient. This was also the secret of success in the fly screen. It's maybe my upbringing from home \u2013 we used to do handicrafts and make toys and I had quite some dexterity in this sense. Eric is also good at these things, so we invented a bunch of tools and tricks that made life much easier \u2013 little things like boxes with a grid for keeping fly stocks (rather than just holding them together with rubber bands as everyone did at the time), and a better system for collecting embryos on agar plates instead having to take them out of the food. And we found a particular type of oil that made embryos transparent so you could look through the chorion, which just made things so much easier and faster for screening. With the fish it was a similar situation: we needed to be able to make all the processes as efficient as possible to do a large-scale screen. I went to Oregon, where zebrafish were quite well established as a model system, but realised that we couldn't possibly do a screen with the way they raised fish \u2013 it was too laborious. So the first job \u2013 and it took two years or so \u2013 was to develop better aquarium and feeding systems and so on to streamline everything and allow us to scale up. Your work now focusses on pigment patterning in adult zebrafish, and in your talk here you introduced the topic as being about the \u2018evolution of beauty\u2019, discussing Darwin's interest in this problem. Did these aesthetic and historic aspects draw you to the problem? I think the Darwin link came later to be honest. Initially, I was just struck by the beauty of the fish, like I had been by the segmentation pattern of flies: it's always nicer to work on something you find beautiful. Working with fish, it's natural to wonder how the pattern is made, and we found a number of mutants with aberrant pigment patterns and started to work on those. To some extent, talking about it in terms of beauty is advertising \u2013 it's a way of explaining why you're working on this obscure problem. And the more you talk about it the more you think about it, and realise that the stripes must have a function \u2013 they must be important. Then I read Darwin's Descent of Man , which is a fascinating book. He thought about the issue of why humans look different across the world \u2013 skin colour, hair colour and so on. At Darwin's time, some people still thought that black and white people were different species (with the whites superior), and Darwin wondered about this \u2013 why are they different, and are they really separate species? He thought that they were too similar to be different species, and he argued that they look different because they have different standards of beauty. He even collected observations from travellers to look for physiological differences (like whether skin colour had a significant effect on heat resistance), but there was no really good biological explanation for why they looked different. So he came up with the idea that it was to do with attractiveness. And when you look around the animal kingdom you see the same thing. The book is partly about sexual dimorphism in the animal kingdom, and beauty is of course very important. When you look at animals like peacocks or birds of paradise, some evolutionary biologists have argued that they grow such extraordinary feathers to prove that they're strong enough to carry them around, or whatever, and of course that's rubbish \u2013 it's about beauty. I found this all very interesting, and now use it as a way of explaining why we're interested in stripes in zebrafish when writing reviews and giving talks. You're here in Singapore at the ISDB meeting giving one of the Nobel Prize lectures. You've said in the past that winning the Nobel Prize, while a great honour, was a distraction for you scientifically. But it must have given you opportunities you wouldn't otherwise have had. How do you feel about the prize now? Yes, I have mixed feelings. When I first won the prize I got carried away \u2013 I got invited to give many lectures, some of which I should have said \u2018no\u2019 to but didn't, and in the end I felt sucked dry. Then I was so exhausted that I said \u2018no\u2019 quite often, but that was also bad because it spoiled my reputation to some extent. It was just too much and it was hard to focus and to get the balance right. And in the lab, although I generally have very smart students and postdocs who work quite independently, I don't think I was there enough to give them proper feedback and advice. You also meet a lot of envy from colleagues, and this is painful sometimes. It has seemed to me that men can have a hard time accepting that women can be smarter, particularly when a woman points out mistakes that the man has made. Throughout my career, I often had difficulties in getting a point across because the men couldn't bear it that I might \u2018win\u2019, and in some cases this got even more difficult after the Nobel Prize. On the other hand, there were interesting opportunities. For example, I was elected onto the National Ethics Council of Germany. I had to learn a huge amount for this \u2013 for example, about mammalian embryology and stem cells \u2013 and this took a lot of time. It was very interesting but, to be honest, it was not fun. There was so much dispute about how to handle some of these issues, and many people were very old-fashioned and even hostile in some cases. And I lost most of the fights \u2013 I was on the liberal side and unfortunately the conservative side usually won. But it was a very interesting experience and I wouldn't have missed it. And of course you also have the opportunity to get in contact with really interesting people through membership of learned societies and academies, and this has been a real reward. You must have been one of only a very few women around when you started in research, and you've talked about how difficult you found this. How do you think the situation for women has changed over the years? It's much better now, though I think we're overshooting a bit in some areas \u2013 search committees run after women in some cases, and that's another danger \u2013 but still have discrimination in other situations. So things aren't yet where they should be. But, more broadly, science has also changed: it's more competitive now with many more scientists and more bad science than there used to be, and it's difficult to survive with an honest and ethical approach to science. I don't think we're in a good place at the moment: it's so hard for people to find jobs, and most scientists don't have permanent contracts. This means that people are forced to advertise and even exaggerate the impact of their work, and waste so much time applying for money \u2013 the funding rate is so low. I didn't have an easy time either when I was struggling to get a job in the early days \u2013 what Eric and I were doing was seen as quite obscure \u2013 but it's so much more difficult today. I find it quite ambiguous to talk people into doing science nowadays because I don't necessarily see it as a very nice or easy job. The important thing with the CNV Foundation is to teach women that it's okay to let people help you because you can't do everything yourself In 2004 you set up the CNV-Stiftung, a foundation that supports women in science with children. What drove you to set up the foundation, and what has it achieved? I have been on committees about women in science since before I was appointed as a Max Planck Director, and after my appointment I was just one of two women directors in the whole society. As I've said, it was very difficult at the time and I felt very awkward. People come up with all sorts of ideas to encourage women in science, and I thought that money is perhaps something that would really help. Women usually do the bulk of the housework and they often don't think it's okay to ask for help from outside \u2013 it took me years to decide to get a cleaner. In general, I find that men either get this stuff done by their wives or they hire someone, but women are more reluctant. So I thought it would be good to give women money to allow them to have an easier life around the house. The important thing with the CNV Foundation is to teach women that it's okay to let people help you because you can't do everything yourself and you need to have some free time. We support around 15 women working in Germany per year: we started out just funding students with children, because they really don't have the money, but now we also support postdocs. But the problem of women in science is very complicated, and while I think our foundation helps, it clearly doesn't solve things. Do you have any advice for young scientists? You really need to be genuinely interested in science and enjoy making discoveries. The job depends on achievements: making discoveries and publishing them. This means hard work, and if you are not rewarded by success it can be very frustrating. You should, as far as possible, avoid mainstream areas and change fields after your PhD in order to be able to develop an independent profile and work on an original, self-selected topic. Don't listen too much to mentors and teachers: they may not be honest but just polite. So it is important to self-critically assess your own abilities in comparison with others. It is your own responsibility. Finally, what might readers of Development be surprised to find out about you? I wrote a cook book, in German, which was published in 2006. I love to cook, and I think there are similarities with working in a lab: the organisation, the working with your hands and so on. I didn't do so much cooking when I actually worked in the lab (though I used to take a cake to the lab every weekend), but when I stopped doing things with my hands at work I started cooking and baking again, and I wrote this book. It is still on the market! And I love music \u2013 I play the flute and sing. I have taken lessons for the last ten years and love to sing German Kunstlieder, and I sometimes give concerts to my friends. \u00a9 2017.
